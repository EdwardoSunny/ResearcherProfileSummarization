        "Abstract": "Intestinal transplantation (ITx) is highly immunogenic, resulting in the need for high levels of immunosuppression, with frequent complications along with high rejection rates. Tolerance induction would provide a solution to these limitations. Detailed studies of alloreactive T cell clones as well as multiparameter flow cytometry in the graft and peripheral tissues have provided evidence for several tolerance mechanisms that occur spontaneously following ITx, which might provide targets for further interventions. These include the frequent occurrence of macrochimerism and engraftment in the recipient bone marrow of donor hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells carried in the allograft. These phenomena are seen most frequently in recipients of multivisceral transplants and are associated with reduced rejection rates. They reflect powerful graft-vs-host responses that enter the peripheral lymphoid system and bone marrow after expanding within and emigrating from the allograft. Several mechanisms of tolerance that may result from this lymphohematopoietic graft-vs-host response are discussed. Transcriptional profiling in quiescent allografts reveals tolerization of pre-existing host-vs-graft-reactive T cells that enter the allograft mucosa and become tissue-resident memory cells. Dissection of the pathways driving and maintaining this tolerant tissue-resident state among donor-reactive T cells will allow controlled tolerance induction through specific therapeutic approaches.",

        "Title": "Enhancing Kidney Transplantation and the Role of Xenografts: Report of a Scientific Workshop Sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation.",
        "Abstract": "Chronic kidney disease affects an estimated 37 million people in the United States; of these,>800,000 have end-stage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Despite efforts to increase the donor kidney supply, approximately 100,000 people are registered on the kidney transplant wait-list with no measurable decrease over the past 2 decades. The outcomes of kidney transplantation are significantly better than for chronic dialysis: kidney transplant recipients have lower rates of mortality and cardiovascular events and better quality of life, but wait-list time matters. Time on dialysis waiting for a deceased-donor kidney is a strong independent risk factor for outcomes after a kidney transplant. Deceased-donor recipients with wait-list times on dialysis of<6 months have graft survival rates equivalent to living-donor recipients with waitlist times on dialysis of>2 years. In 2021,>12,000 people had been on the kidney transplant waitlist for\u00a0\u22655 years. As the gap between the demand for and availability of donor kidneys for allotransplantation continues to widen, alternative strategies are needed to provide a stable, sufficient, and timely supply. A strategy that is gaining momentum toward clinical application is pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation. This report summarizes the proceedings of a meeting convened on April 11-12, 2022, by the National Kidney Foundation to review and assess the state of pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation as a potential cure for end-stage renal disease.",

        "Abstract": "Liver metastasis (LM) confers poor survival and therapy resistance across cancer types, but the mechanisms of liver-metastatic organotropism remain unknown. Here, through in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we found that Pip4k2c loss conferred LM but had no impact on lung metastasis or primary tumor growth. Pip4k2c-deficient cells were hypersensitized to insulin-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling and exploited the insulin-rich liver milieu for organ-specific metastasis. We observed concordant changes in PIP4K2C expression and distinct metabolic changes in 3,511 patient melanomas, including primary tumors, LMs and lung metastases. We found that systemic PI3K inhibition exacerbated LM burden in mice injected with Pip4k2c-deficient cancer cells through host-mediated increase in hepatic insulin levels; however, this circuit could be broken by concurrent administration of an SGLT2 inhibitor or feeding of a ketogenic diet. Thus, this work demonstrates a rare example of metastatic organotropism through co-optation of physiological metabolic cues and proposes therapeutic avenues to counteract these mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "The site of transition between tissue-resident memory (TRM) and circulating phenotypes of T cells is unknown. We integrated clonotype, alloreactivity, and gene expression profiles of graft-repopulating recipient T cells in the intestinal mucosa at the single-cell level after human intestinal transplantation. Host-versus-graft (HvG)-reactive T cells were mainly distributed to TRM, effector T (Teff)/TRM, and T follicular helper compartments. RNA velocity analysis demonstrated a trajectory from TRM to Teff/TRM clusters in association with rejection. By integrating pre- and post-transplantation (Tx) mixed lymphocyte reaction-determined alloreactive repertoires, we observed that pre-existing HvG-reactive T cells that demonstrated tolerance in the circulation were dominated by TRM profiles in quiescent allografts. Putative de novo HvG-reactive clones showed a transcriptional profile skewed to cytotoxic effectors in rejecting grafts. Inferred protein regulon network analysis revealed upstream regulators that accounted for the effector and tolerant T cell states. We demonstrate Teff/TRM interchangeability for individual T cell clones with known (allo)recognition in the human gut, providing novel insight into TRM biology.",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal transplantation is the definitive treatment for intestinal failure. However, tissue rejection and graft-versus-host disease are relatively common complications, necessitating aggressive immunosuppression that can itself pose further complications. Tracking intraluminal markers in ileal effluent from standard ileostomies may present a noninvasive and sensitive way to detect developing pathology within the intestinal graft. This would be an improvement compared to current assessments, which are limited by poor sensitivity and specificity, contributing to under or over-immunosuppression, respectively, and by the need for invasive biopsies. Herein, we report an approach to reproducibly analyze ileal fluid obtained through stoma sampling for antimicrobial peptide/protein concentrations, reasoning that these molecules may provide an assessment of intestinal homeostasis and levels of intestinal inflammation over time. Concentrations of lysozyme (LYZ), myeloperoxidase (MPO), calprotectin (S100A8/A9) and \u03b2-defensin 2 (DEFB2) were assessed using adaptations of commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The concentration of \u03b1-defensin 5 (DEFA5) was assessed using a newly developed sandwich ELISA. Our data support that with proper preparation of ileal effluent specimens, precise and replicable determination of antimicrobial peptide/protein concentrations can be achieved for each of these target molecules via ELISA. This approach may prove to be reliable as a clinically useful assessment of intestinal homeostasis over time for patients with ileostomies.",

        "Abstract": "It is unknown how intestinal B cell populations and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires are established and maintained over time in humans. Following intestinal transplantation (ITx), surveillance ileal mucosal biopsies provide a unique opportunity to map the dynamic establishment of gut lymphocyte populations. Using polychromatic flow cytometry that includes HLA allele group-specific mAbs distinguishing donor from recipient cells along with high throughput BCR sequencing, we tracked the establishment of recipient B cell populations and BCR repertoire in the allograft mucosa of ITx recipients. We confirm the early presence of na\u00efve donor B cells in the circulation and, for the first time, document the establishment of recipient B cell populations, including B resident memory cells, in the intestinal allograft mucosa. Recipient B cell repopulation of the allograft was most rapid in infant (<1 year old)-derived allografts and, unlike T cell repopulation, did not correlate with rejection rates. While recipient memory B cell populations were increased in graft mucosa compared to circulation, na\u00efve recipient B cells remained detectable in the graft mucosa for years. Comparisons of peripheral and intra-mucosal B cell repertoires in the absence of rejection revealed increased BCR mutation rates and clonal expansion in graft mucosa compared to circulating B cells, but these parameters did not increase markedly after the first year post-transplant. Furthermore, clonal mixing between the allograft mucosa and the circulation was significantly greater in ITx recipients, even years after transplantation, than in healthy control adults. Collectively, our data demonstrate intestinal mucosal B cell repertoire establishment from a circulating pool, a process that continues for years without evidence of establishment of a stable mucosal B cell repertoire.",

        "Abstract": "T cell immunity plays a central role in clinical outcomes of Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and T cell-focused vaccination or cellular immunotherapy might provide enhanced protection for some immunocompromised patients. Pre-existing T cell memory recognizing SARS-CoV-2 antigens antedating COVID-19 infection or vaccination, may have developed as an imprint of prior infections with endemic non-SARS human coronaviruses (hCoVs) OC43, HKU1, 229E, NL63, pathogens of \"common cold\". In turn, SARS-CoV-2-primed T cells may recognize emerging variants or other hCoV viruses and modulate the course of subsequent hCoV infections. Cross-immunity between hCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 has not been well characterized. Here, we systematically investigated T cell responses against the immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins and corresponding antigens from \u03b1- and \u03b2-hCoVs among vaccinated, convalescent, and unexposed subjects. Broad T cell immunity against all tested SARS-CoV-2 antigens emerged in COVID-19 survivors. In convalescent and in vaccinated individuals, SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cells reliably recognized most SARS-CoV-2 variants, however cross-reactivity against the ",

Regulatory dendritic cells (DCreg) are innate immune cells that down-regulate alloimmune responses in preclinical models. Here, we performed clinical monitoring and comprehensive assessment of peripheral and allograft tissue immune cell populations in DCreg-infused live-donor liver transplant (LDLT) recipients up to 12 months (M) after transplant. Thirteen patients were given a single infusion of donor-derived DCreg 1 week before transplant (STUDY) and were compared with 40 propensity-matched standard-of-care (SOC) patients. Donor-derived DCreg infusion was well tolerated in all STUDY patients. There were no differences in postoperative complications or biopsy-confirmed acute rejection compared with SOC patients up to 12M.

        "Abstract": "Mixed allogeneic chimerism has considerable potential to advance the achievement of immune tolerance to alloantigens for transplantation and the restoration of self-tolerance in patients with autoimmune disease. In this article, I review evidence that graft-versus-host (GVH) alloreactivity without graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), termed a lymphohematopoietic graft-vs-host reaction (LGVHR), can promote the induction of mixed chimerism with minimal toxicity. LGVHR was originally shown to occur in an animal model when non-tolerant donor lymphocytes were administered to mixed chimeras in the absence of inflammatory stimuli and was found to mediate powerful graft-vs-leukemia/lymphoma effects without GVHD. Recent large animal studies suggest a role for LGVHR in promoting durable mixed chimerism and the demonstration that LGVHR promotes chimerism in human intestinal allograft recipients has led to a pilot study aiming to achieve durable mixed chimerism.",

        "Abstract": "The cell-autonomous balance of immune-inhibitory and -stimulatory signals is a critical process in cancer immune evasion. Using patient-derived co-cultures, humanized mouse models, and single-cell RNA-sequencing of patient melanomas biopsied before and on immune checkpoint blockade, we find that intact cancer cell-intrinsic expression of CD58 and ligation to CD2 is required for anti-tumor immunity and is predictive of treatment response. Defects in this axis promote immune evasion through diminished T\u00a0cell activation, impaired intratumoral T\u00a0cell infiltration and proliferation, and concurrently increased PD-L1 protein stabilization. Through CRISPR-Cas9 and proteomics screens, we identify and validate CMTM6 as critical for CD58 stability and upregulation of PD-L1 upon CD58 loss. Competition between CD58 and PD-L1 for CMTM6 binding determines their rate of endosomal recycling over lysosomal degradation. Overall, we describe an underappreciated yet critical axis of cancer immunity and provide a molecular basis for how cancer cells balance immune inhibitory and stimulatory cues.",

        "Abstract": "Robust human immune system (HIS) mice are created using human fetal thymus tissue and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). A HIS mouse model using neonatal human thymus tissue and umbilical cord blood (CB) HSCs (NeoHu) was recently described. We improved the model by removing the native murine thymus, which can also generate human T cells, and demonstrated definitively the capacity of human T cells to develop in a grafted neonatal human thymus. Human T cells derived from the neonatal thymus tissue appeared in peripheral blood early post-transplantation and CB-derived T cells appeared later. Na\u00efve T cells were demonstrated in peripheral blood but effector memory and T peripheral helper phenotypes predominated later, in association with development of autoimmunity in some animals. Treatment of thymus grafts with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) increased the proportion of stem cells derived from injected HSCs, delayed onset of autoimmune disease, reduced early T cell reconstitution, and reduced effector/memory T cell conversion. Younger neonatal human thymus tissue was associated with improved T cell reconstitution. While the NeoHu model bypasses the need for fetal tissue, it has yet to demonstrate equivalent reconstitution to fetal tissue, though 2-DG can improve results by removing native thymocytes prior to transplantation.",

        "Abstract": "T cell immunity plays a central role in clinical outcomes of Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, T cell-focused vaccination or cellular immunotherapy might provide enhanced protection for immunocompromised patients. Pre-existing T cell memory recognizing SARS-CoV2 antigens antedating COVID-19 infection or vaccination, may have developed as an imprint of prior infections with endemic non-SARS human coronaviruses (hCoVs) OC43, HKU1, 229E, NL63, pathogens of \"common cold\". In turn, SARS-CoV2-primed T cells may recognize emerging variants or other hCoV viruses and modulate the course of subsequent hCoV infections. Cross-immunity between hCoVs and SARS-CoV2 has not been well characterized. Here, we systematically investigated T cell responses against the immunodominant SARS-CoV2 spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins and corresponding antigens from \u03b1- and \u03b2-hCoVs among vaccinated, convalescent, and unexposed subjects. Broad T cell immunity against all tested SARS-CoV2 antigens emerged in COVID-19 survivors. In convalescent and in vaccinated individuals, SARS-CoV2 spike-specific T cells reliably recognized most SARS-CoV2 variants, however cross-reactivity against the ",

        "Abstract": "Transgenic CD47 overexpression is an encouraging approach to ameliorating xenograft rejection and alloresponses to pluripotent stem cells, and the efficacy correlates with the level of CD47 expression. However, CD47, upon ligation, also transmits signals leading to cell dysfunction or death, raising a concern that overexpressing CD47 could be harmful. Here, we unveiled an alternative source of cell surface CD47. We showed that extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, released from normal or tumor cells overexpressing CD47 (transgenic or native) can induce efficient CD47 cross-dressing on pig or human cells. Like the autogenous CD47, CD47 cross-dressed on cell surfaces is capable of interacting with SIRP\u03b1 to inhibit phagocytosis. However, ligation of the autogenous, but not cross-dressed, CD47 induced cell death. Thus, CD47 cross-dressing provides an alternative source of cell surface CD47 that may elicit its anti-phagocytic function without transmitting harmful signals to the cells. CD47 cross-dressing also suggests a previously unidentified mechanism for tumor-induced immunosuppression. Our findings should help to further optimize the CD47 transgenic approach that may improve outcomes by minimizing the harmful effects of CD47 overexpression.",

        "Abstract": "A major limitation of organ allotransplantation is the insufficient supply of donor organs. Consequently, thousands of patients die every year while waiting for a transplant. Progress in xenotransplantation that has permitted pig organ graft survivals of years in non-human primates has led to renewed excitement about the potential of this approach to alleviate the organ shortage. In 2022, the first pig-to-human heart transplant was performed on a compassionate use basis, and xenotransplantation experiments using pig kidneys in deceased human recipients provided encouraging data. Many advances in xenotransplantation have resulted from improvements in the ability to genetically modify pigs using CRISPR-Cas9 and other methodologies. Gene editing has the capacity to generate pig organs that more closely resemble those of humans and are hence more physiologically compatible and less prone to rejection. Despite such modifications, immune responses to xenografts remain powerful and multi-faceted, involving innate immune components that do not attack allografts. Thus, the induction of innate and adaptive immune tolerance to prevent rejection while preserving the capacity of the immune system to protect the recipient and the graft from infection is desirable to enable clinical xenotransplantation.",

        "Abstract": "The authors of this article, all women who have been deeply committed to the Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies (FOCIS), performed a retrospective analysis of gender equality practices of FOCIS to identify areas for improvement and make recommendations accordingly. Gender data were obtained and analyzed for the period from January 2010 to July 2021. Outcome measures included numbers of men and women across the following categories: membership enrollment, meeting and course faculty and attendees, committee and leadership composition. FOCIS' past and present leaders, steering committee members, FCE directors, individual members, as well as education, annual meeting scientific program and FCE committee members and management staff of FOCIS were surveyed by email questionnaire for feedback on FOCIS policies and practice with respect to gender equality and inclusion. Although women represent 50% of the membership, they have been underrepresented in all leadership, educational, and committee roles within the FOCIS organization. Surveying FOCIS leadership and membership revealed a growing recognition of disparities in female leadership across all FOCIS missions, leading to significant improvement in multiple areas since 2016. We highlight these changes and propose a number of recommendations that can be used by FOCIS to improve gender equality.",

The codebase includes user-friendly default analyses with customizable parameters which greatly accelerate computational workflows and provide robust statistics comparing post-transplant specimens to pre-transplant baseline. It also includes helper functions for robust characterization of T-cell-repertoire diversity, sample-to-sample divergence, resolution of sample-of-origin ambiguity in pooled assays, and functions to output all sequences defined as alloreactive.",

        "Title": "Chimerism-Based Tolerance to Kidney Allografts in Humans: Novel Insights and Future Perspectives.",
        "Abstract": "Chronic rejection and immunosuppression-related toxicity severely affect long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation. The induction of transplantation tolerance - the lack of destructive immune responses to a transplanted organ in the absence of immunosuppression - could potentially overcome these limitations. Immune tolerance to kidney allografts from living donors has been successfully achieved in humans through clinical protocols based on chimerism induction with hematopoietic cell transplantation after non-myeloablative conditioning. Notably, two of these protocols have led to immune tolerance in a significant fraction of HLA-mismatched donor-recipient combinations, which represent the large majority of cases in clinical practice. Studies in mice and large animals have been critical in dissecting tolerance mechanisms and in selecting the most promising approaches for human translation. However, there are several key differences in tolerance induction between these models and humans, including the rate of success and stability of donor chimerism, as well as the relative contribution of different mechanisms in inducing donor-specific unresponsiveness. Kidney allograft tolerance achieved through durable full-donor chimerism may be due to central deletion of graft-reactive donor T cells, even though mechanistic data from patient series are lacking. On the other hand, immune tolerance attained with transient mixed chimerism-based protocols initially relies on Treg-mediated suppression, followed by peripheral deletion of donor-reactive recipient T-cell clones under antigenic pressure from the graft. These conclusions were supported by data deriving from novel high-throughput T-cell receptor sequencing approaches that allowed tracking of alloreactive repertoires over time. In this review, we summarize the most important mechanistic studies on tolerance induction with combined kidney-bone marrow transplantation in humans, discussing open issues that still need to be addressed and focusing on techniques developed in recent years to efficiently monitor the alloresponse in tolerance trials. These cutting-edge methods will be instrumental for the development of immune tolerance protocols with improved efficacy and to identify patients amenable to safe immunosuppression withdrawal.",

        "Abstract": "In this review, we summarize and discuss recent advances in understanding the characteristics of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) in the context of solid organ transplantation (SOT). We first introduce the traditionally understood noncirculating features of TRMs and the key phenotypic markers that define this population, then provide a detailed discussion of emerging concepts on the recirculation and plasticity of TRM in mice and humans. We comment on the potential heterogeneity of transient, temporary resident, and permanent resident T cells and potential interchangeable phenotypes between TRM and effector T cells in nonlymphoid tissues. We review the literature on the distribution of TRM in human nonlymphoid organs and association of clinical outcomes in different types of SOT, including intestine, lung, liver, kidney, and heart. We focus on both tissue-specific and organ-shared features of donor- and recipient-derived TRMs after transplantation whenever applicable. Studies with comprehensive sample collection, including longitudinal and cross-sectional controls, and applied advanced techniques such as multicolor flow cytometry to distinguish donor and recipient TRMs, bulk, and single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing to track clonotypes and define transcriptome profiles, and functional readouts to define alloreactivity and proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory activities are emphasized. We also discuss important findings on the tissue-resident features of regulatory \u03b1\u03b2 T cells and unconventional \u03b3\u03b4 T cells after transplantation. Understanding of TRM in SOT is a rapidly growing field that urges future studies to address unresolved questions regarding their heterogeneity, plasticity, longevity, alloreactivity, and roles in rejection and tolerance.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in high throughput sequencing (HTS) of T cell receptors (TCRs) and in transcriptomic analysis, particularly at the single cell level, have opened the door to a new level of understanding of human immunology and immune-related diseases. In this article, we discuss the use of HTS of TCRs to discern the factors controlling human T cell repertoire development and how this approach can be used in combination with human immune system (HIS) mouse models to understand human repertoire selection in an unprecedented manner. An exceptionally high proportion of human T cells has alloreactive potential, which can best be understood as a consequence of the processes governing thymic selection. High throughput TCR sequencing has allowed assessment of the development, magnitude and nature of the human alloresponse at a new level and has provided a tool for tracking the fate of pre-transplant-defined donor- and host-reactive TCRs following transplantation. New insights into human allograft rejection and tolerance obtained with this method in combination with single cell transcriptional analyses are reviewed here.",

        "Abstract": "Nephrotic syndrome is a common complication of pig-to-baboon kidney xenotransplantation (KXTx) that adversely affects outcomes. We have reported that upregulation of CD80 and down-regulation of SMPDL-3b in glomeruli have an important role in the development of proteinuria following pig-to-baboon KXTx. Recently we found induced expression of human CD47 (hCD47) on endothelial cells and podocytes isolated from hCD47 transgenic (Tg) swine markedly reduced phagocytosis by baboon and human macrophages. These observations led us to hypothesize that transplanting hCD47 Tg porcine kidneys could overcome the incompatibility of the porcine CD47-baboon SIRP\u03b1 interspecies ligand-receptor interaction and prevent the development of proteinuria following KXTx.",

        "Title": "Lymphohematopoietic graft-versus-host responses promote mixed chimerism in patients receiving intestinal transplantation.",
        "Abstract": "In humans receiving intestinal transplantation (ITx), long-term multilineage blood chimerism often develops. Donor T cell macrochimerism (\u22654%) frequently occurs without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and is associated with reduced rejection. Here we demonstrate that patients with macrochimerism had high graft-versus-host (GvH) to host-versus-graft (HvG) T cell clonal ratios in their allografts. These GvH clones entered the circulation, where their peak levels were associated with declines in HvG clones early after transplant, suggesting that GvH reactions may contribute to chimerism and control HvG responses without causing GVHD. Consistently, donor-derived T cells, including GvH clones, and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were simultaneously detected in the recipients' BM more than 100 days after transplant. Individual GvH clones appeared in ileal mucosa or PBMCs before detection in recipient BM, consistent with an intestinal mucosal origin, where donor GvH-reactive T cells expanded early upon entry of recipient APCs into the graft. These results, combined with cytotoxic single-cell transcriptional profiles of donor T cells in recipient BM, suggest that tissue-resident GvH-reactive donor T cells migrated into the recipient circulation and BM, where they destroyed recipient hematopoietic cells through cytolytic effector functions and promoted engraftment of graft-derived HSPCs that maintain chimerism. These mechanisms suggest an approach to achieving intestinal allograft tolerance.",

        "Abstract": "We evaluated the role of the thymus in development of multi-organ autoimmunity in human immune system (HIS) mice. T cells were essential for disease development and the same T cell clones with varying phenotypes infiltrated multiple tissues. De novo-generated hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-derived T cells were the major disease drivers, though thymocytes pre-existing in grafted human thymi contributed if not first depleted. HIS mice with a native mouse thymus developed disease earlier than thymectomized mice with a thymocyte-depleted human thymus graft. Defective structure in the native mouse thymus was associated with impaired negative selection of thymocytes expressing a transgenic TCR recognizing a self-antigen. Disease developed without direct recognition of antigens on recipient mouse MHC. While human thymus grafts had normal structure and negative selection, failure to tolerize human T cells recognizing mouse antigens presented on HLA molecules may explain eventual disease development. These new insights have implications for human autoimmunity and suggest methods of avoiding autoimmunity in next-generation HIS mice.",

        "Abstract": "T cells are implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), yet their clonality, specificity, and function are incompletely defined. Here we used T cell receptor \u03b2 chain (TCRB) sequencing to study the T cell repertoire in the coronary artery, endomyocardium, and peripheral blood at the time of retransplant in four cases of CAV and compared it to the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) repertoire from the same samples. High-dimensional flow cytometry coupled with single-cell PCR was also used to define the T cell phenotype. Extensive overlap was observed between intragraft and blood TCRBs in all cases, a finding supported by robust quantitative diversity metrics. In contrast, blood and graft IGHV repertoires from the same samples showed minimal overlap. Coronary infiltrates included CD4",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in gene editing technology have enabled the production of multi-knockout (KO) and transgenic pigs in order to overcome immunologic barriers in xenotransplantation (XTx). However, the genetic manipulations required to produce these changes may have the unintended consequence of producing or revealing neoantigens reactive with natural antibodies present in baboons. In this study, we examined whether the neoantigens that develop in multi-transgenic (mTg) GalT, Cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH), \u03b2-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 2 (B4) KO pigs can cause rejection of xenografts in baboons.",

        "Abstract": "During T cell development in mice, thymic negative selection deletes cells with the potential to recognize and react to self-antigens. In human T cell-dependent autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, T cells reactive to autoantigens are thought to escape negative selection, traffic to the periphery and attack self-tissues. However, physiological thymic negative selection of autoreactive human T cells has not been previously studied. We now describe a human T-cell receptor-transgenic humanized mouse model that permits the study of autoreactive T-cell development in a human thymus. Our studies demonstrate that thymocytes expressing the autoreactive Clone 5 TCR, which recognizes insulin B:9-23 presented by HLA-DQ8, are efficiently negatively selected at the double and single positive stage in human immune systems derived from HLA-DQ8",

        "Abstract": "Although short-term outcomes for liver transplantation have improved, patient and graft survival are limited by infection, cancer, and other complications of immunosuppression. Rapid induction of tolerance after liver transplantation would decrease these complications, improving survival and quality of life. Tolerance to kidneys, but not thoracic organs or islets, has been achieved in nonhuman primates and humans through the induction of transient donor chimerism. Since the liver is considered to be tolerogenic, we tested the hypothesis that the renal transplant transient chimerism protocol would induce liver tolerance.",

The Fourth International Workshop on Clinical Tolerance was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, September 5-6, 2019. This report is a summary of presentations on the status of clinical trials designed to minimize or withdraw immunosuppressive drugs in kidney, liver, and lung transplantation without subsequent evidence of rejection. All protocols had in common the use of donor or recipient cell therapy combined with organ transplantation. The workshop also included presentations of mechanistic studies designed to improve understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of tolerance and to identify potential predictors/biomarkers of tolerance. Strategies to enhance the safety of hematopoietic cell transplantation and to improve patient selection/risk stratification for clinical trials were also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "The success of organ transplantation is limited by the complications of immunosuppression, by chronic rejection, and by the insufficient organ supply, and thousands of patients die every year while waiting for a transplant. With recent progress in xenotransplantation permitting porcine organ graft survival of months or even years in nonhuman primates, there is renewed interest in its potential to alleviate the organ shortage. Many of these advances are the result of our heightened capacity to modify pigs genetically, particularly with the development of CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing methodologies. Although this approach allows the engineering of pig organs that are less prone to rejection, the clinical application of xenotransplantation will require the ability to avoid the ravages of a multifaceted attack on the immune system while preserving the capacity to protect both the recipient and the graft from infectious microorganisms. In this review, we will discuss the potential and limitations of these modifications and how the engineering of the graft can be leveraged to alter the host immune response so that all types of immune attack are avoided.",

        "Abstract": "The humanized IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody siplizumab and its rat parent monoclonal IgG2b antibody BTI-322 are directed against the CD2 antigen. Siplizumab is species-specific, reacting with human and chimpanzee cells but not with cells from any other species, including other non-human primates. Because siplizumab treatment has recently shown great potential in clinical transplantation, we now present the results of our previous pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety studies of both antibodies. Fourteen chimpanzees received 1-3 doses of 0.143 to 5.0\u00a0mg/kg iv The effects were followed with flow cytometry on peripheral lymphocytes and staining of lymph nodes. Side effects were recorded. Serum antibody concentrations were followed. Across the doses, a rapid, transient depletion of CD2, CD3, CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes and NK cells was observed for both antibodies. Immune reconstitution was more rapid for BTI-322 compared to siplizumab. Paracortical lymph node T cell depletion was moderate, estimated at 45% with doses of >0.6\u00a0mg/kg. Restoration of lymph node architecture was seen after two weeks to two months for all animals. All four subjects receiving BTI-322 experienced AEs on the first dosing day, while the eight subjects dosed with siplizumab experienced few mild, transient AEs. Infusion with siplizumab and BTI-322 resulted in rapid depletion of CD2",

The ideal approach would generate donor-specific unresponsiveness to the pig organ without suppressing the patient's normal immune function. Porcine thymus transplantation has shown efficacy in promoting xenotolerance in humanized mice and large animal models. However, murine studies demonstrate that T cells selected in a swine thymus are positively selected only by swine thymic epithelial cells, and therefore, cells expressing human HLA-restricted TCRs may not be selected efficiently in a transplanted pig thymus. This may lead to suboptimal patient immune function.",

The treatment is species-specific due to structural CD2 antigen differences between nonhuman primates and humans. Herein, we report the safety profile and efficacy of two modifications of the same anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody in cynomolgus macaques. Twelve subjects received one i.v. anti-CD2 (of rat or rhesus type) dose each, range 1-4\u00a0mg/kg, and were followed for 1-7\u00a0days. Treatment effects were evaluated with flow cytometry on peripheral blood and histopathological evaluation of secondary lymphoid organs. In vitro inhibitory activity on primary MHC disparate mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) was determined. Upon anti-CD2 treatment, CD4",

        "Abstract": "We recently developed a high throughput T cell receptor \u03b2 chain (TCR\u03b2) sequencing-based approach to identifying and tracking donor-reactive T cells. To address the role of clonal deletion in liver allograft tolerance, we applied this method in samples from a recent randomized study, ITN030ST, in which immunosuppression withdrawal was attempted within 2\u00a0years of liver transplantation. We identified donor-reactive T cell clones via TCR\u03b2 sequencing following a pre-transplant mixed lymphocyte reaction and tracked these clones in the circulation following transplantation in 3 tolerant and 5 non-tolerant subjects. All subjects showed a downward trend and significant reductions in donor-reactive TCR\u03b2 sequences were detected post-transplant in 6 of 8 subjects, including 2 tolerant and 4 non-tolerant recipients. Reductions in donor-reactive TCR\u03b2 sequences were greater than those of all other TCR\u03b2 sequences, including 3rd party-reactive sequences, in all 8 subjects, demonstrating an impact of the liver allograft after accounting for repertoire turnover. Although limited by patient number and heterogeneity, our results suggest that partial deletion of donor-reactive T cell clones may be a consequence of liver transplantation and does not correlate with success or failure of early immunosuppression withdrawal. These observations underscore the organ- and/or protocol-specific nature of tolerance mechanisms in humans.",

We have recently documented that sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase-3 (SMPDL3b) and CD80 expressed on podocytes in porcine kidney grafts contribute to this complication. We have hypothesized that one regulator of immune function is CD47 and that incompatibilities in CD47 between pig and baboon could potentially affect macrophage function, increasing the susceptibility of the kidney grafts to immunologically induced injury.",

        "Abstract": "This review focuses on our recent studies involving nonmyeloablative bone marrow transplantation as an approach to inducing organ allograft tolerance across MHC barriers in nonhuman primates and in patients. The clinical studies are focused on mechanisms of tolerance involved in a protocol carried out at Massachusetts General Hospital in HLA-mismatched haploidentical combinations for the induction of renal allograft tolerance. These studies, in which chimerism was only transient and GVHD did not occur, suggest an early role for donor-specific regulatory T cells in tolerance induction, followed by partial and gradual deletion of donor-reactive T cells. We utilized high-throughput sequencing methodologies in a novel way to identify and track large numbers of alloreactive T cell receptors (TCRs). This method has been shown to identify biologically significant alloreactive TCRs in transplant patients and pointed to clonal deletion as a major mechanism of long-term tolerance in these patients. More recently, we adapted this sequencing method to optimally identify the donor-specific regulatory T cell (Treg) repertoire. Interrogation of the early posttransplant repertoire demonstrated expansion of donor-specific Tregs in association with tolerance. Our studies suggest a role for the kidney graft in tolerance by these mechanisms in patients who had only transient chimerism. Nonhuman primate studies indicate that other organs, including the heart, the lungs and the liver, are less readily tolerated following a period of transient mixed chimerism. Our efforts to extend the reach of mixed chimerism for tolerance induction beyond the kidney are therefore focused on the addition of recipient Tregs to the protocol. This approach has the potential to enhance chimerism while further reducing the risk of GVHD.",

        "Abstract": "The specific cellular physiology of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is underexplored, and their maintenance in\u00a0vitro remains challenging. We discovered that culture of HSCs in low calcium increased their maintenance as determined by phenotype, function, and single-cell expression signature. HSCs are endowed with low intracellular calcium conveyed by\u00a0elevated activity of glycolysis-fueled plasma membrane calcium efflux pumps and a low-bone-marrow interstitial fluid calcium concentration. Low-calcium conditions inhibited calpain proteases, which target ten-eleven translocated (TET) enzymes, of which TET2 was required for the effect of low calcium conditions on HSC maintenance in\u00a0vitro. These observations reveal a physiological feature of HSCs that can be harnessed to improve their maintenance in\u00a0vitro.",

        "Abstract": "We investigated human T-cell repertoire formation using high throughput TCR\u03b2 CDR3 sequencing in immunodeficient mice receiving human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and human thymus grafts. Replicate humanized mice generated diverse and highly divergent repertoires. Repertoire narrowing and increased CDR3\u03b2 sharing was observed during thymocyte selection. While hydrophobicity analysis implicated self-peptides in positive selection of the overall repertoire, positive selection favored shorter shared sequences that had reduced hydrophobicity at positions 6 and 7 of CDR3\u03b2s, suggesting weaker interactions with self-peptides than unshared sequences, possibly allowing escape from negative selection. Sharing was similar between autologous and allogeneic thymi and occurred between different cell subsets. Shared sequences were enriched for allo-crossreactive CDR3\u03b2s and for Type 1 diabetes-associated autoreactive CDR3\u03b2s. Single-cell TCR-sequencing showed increased sharing of CDR3\u03b1s compared to CDR3\u03b2s between mice. Our data collectively implicate preferential positive selection for shared human CDR3\u03b2s that are highly cross-reactive. While previous studies suggested a role for recombination bias in producing \"public\" sequences in mice, our study is the first to demonstrate a role for thymic selection. Our results implicate positive selection for promiscuous TCR\u03b2 sequences that likely evade negative selection, due to their low affinity for self-ligands, in the abundance of \"public\" human TCR\u03b2 sequences.",

        "Abstract": "Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has recently been increasingly reported as an important complication after stem cell transplantation, in line with the increase in the number of HLA-mismatched transplantation. Although previous clinical studies have shown an elevation of inflammatory cytokines in patients with HLH after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as well as those after viral infection or autoimmune disease, the disease pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Here we explored this issue in humanized mice with functional human lymphohematopoietic systems, which were constructed by transplantation of human CD34",

        "Abstract": "Reliable in vitro expansion protocols of regulatory T cells (Tregs) are needed for clinical use. We studied the biology of Mauritian Cynomolgus macaque (MCM) Tregs and developed four in vitro Treg expansion protocols for translational studies. Tregs expanded 3000-fold when artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs) expressing human CD80, CD58 and CD32 were used throughout the culture. When donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were used as the single source of APCs followed by aAPCs, Tregs expanded 2000-fold. Tregs from all protocols suppressed the proliferation of anti-CD2CD3CD28 bead-stimulated autologous PBMCs albeit with different potencies, varying from 1:2-1:4 Treg:PBMC ratios, up to >1:32. Reculture of cryopreserved Tregs permitted reexpansion with improved suppressive activity. Occasionally, CD8 contamination was observed and resolved by resorting. Specificity studies showed greater suppression of stimulation by anti-CD2CD3CD28 beads of PBMCs from the same donor used for stimulation during the Treg cultures and of autologous cells than of third-party PBMC responders. Similar to humans, the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) within the Foxp3 locus correlated with suppressive activity and expression of Foxp3. Contrary to humans, FoxP3 expression did not correlate with CD45RA or CD127 expression. In summary, we have characterized MCM Tregs and developed four Treg expansion protocols that can be used for preclinical applications.",

        "Abstract": "Human intestinal transplantation often results in long-term mixed chimerism of donor and recipient blood in transplant patients. We followed the phenotypes of chimeric peripheral blood cells in 21 patients receiving intestinal allografts over 5 years. Donor lymphocyte phenotypes suggested a contribution of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from the graft. Surprisingly, we detected donor-derived HSPCs in intestinal mucosa, Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver. Human gut HSPCs are phenotypically similar to bone marrow HSPCs and have multilineage differentiation potential in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Analysis of circulating post-transplant donor T\u00a0cells suggests that they undergo selection in recipient lymphoid organs to acquire immune tolerance. Our longitudinal study of human HSPCs carried in intestinal allografts demonstrates their turnover kinetics and gradual replacement of donor-derived HSPCs from a circulating pool. Thus, we have demonstrated the existence of\u00a0functioning HSPCs in human intestines with implications for promoting tolerance in transplant recipients.",

        "Abstract": "Allograft tolerance, in which a graft is accepted without long-term immunosuppression, could overcome numerous obstacles in transplantation. Human allograft tolerance has been intentionally induced across HLA barriers via combined kidney and bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT) with a regimen that induces only transient chimerism. Tregs are enriched early after CKBMT. While deletional tolerance contributes to long-term tolerance, the role of Tregs remains unclear. We have optimized a method for identifying the donor-specific Treg repertoire and used it to interrogate the fate of donor-specific Tregs after CKBMT. We expanded Tregs with several different protocols. Using functional analyses and T cell receptor sequencing, we found that expanding sorted Tregs with activated donor B cells identified the broadest Treg repertoire with the greatest potency and donor specificity of suppression. This method outperformed both alloantigen stimulation with CTLA4Ig and sequencing of CFSElo cells from the primary mixed lymphocyte reaction. In 3 tolerant and 1 nontolerant CKBMT recipients, we sequenced donor-specific Tregs before transplant and tracked them after transplant. Preexisting donor-specific Tregs were expanded at 6 months after CKBMT in tolerant patients and were reduced in the nontolerant patient. These results suggest that early expansion of donor-specific Tregs is involved in tolerance induction following CKBMT.",

        "Abstract": "Alloreactive T lymphocytes are the primary mediators of immune responses in transplantation, both in the graft-versus-host and host-versus-graft directions. While essentially all clones comprising the human T cell repertoire have been selected on self-peptide presented by self-human leukocyte antigens (self-HLAs), much remains to be understood about the nature of clones capable of responding to allo-HLA molecules. Quantitative tools to study these cells are critical to understand fundamental features of this important response; however, the large size and diversity of the alloreactive T cell repertoire in humans presents a great technical challenge. We have developed a high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing approach to characterize the human alloresponse. We present a statistical method to model T cell clonal frequency distribution and quantify repertoire diversity. Using these approaches, we measured the diversity and frequency of distinct alloreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations in HLA-mismatched responder-stimulator pairs. Our findings indicate that the alloimmune repertoire is highly specific for a given pair of individuals, that most alloreactive clones circulate at low frequencies, and that a high proportion of TCRs is likely able to recognize alloantigens.",

        "Abstract": "The last 15\u00a0years or so have seen exciting progress in xenotransplantation, with porcine organ grafts surviving months or even years in non-human primates. These advances reflect the application of new scientific knowledge, improved immunosuppressive agents, and genetic engineering. The field has recently enjoyed a renaissance of interest and hope, largely due to the exponential increase in our capacity to genetically engineer porcine source animals. However, immune responses to xenografts are very powerful and widespread clinical application of xenotransplantation will depend on the ability to suppress these immune responses while preserving the capacity to protect both the recipient and the graft from infectious microorganisms. Our work over the last three decades has aimed to engineer the immune system of the recipient in a manner that achieves specific tolerance to the xenogeneic donor while preserving otherwise normal immune function. Important proofs of principle have been obtained, first in rodents, and later in human immune systems in \"humanized mice\" and finally in non-human primates, demonstrating the capacity and potential synergy of mixed xenogeneic chimerism and xenogeneic thymic transplantation in tolerizing multiple arms of the immune system. Considering the fact that clinical tolerance has recently been achieved for allografts and the even greater importance of avoiding excessive immunosuppression for xenografts, it is my belief that it is both possible and imperative that we likewise achieve xenograft tolerance. I expect this to be accomplished through the availability of targeted approaches to recipient immune conditioning, understanding of immunological mechanisms of tolerance, advanced knowledge of physiological incompatibilities, and the availability of inbred miniature swine with optimized use of genetic engineering.",

However, research in this area has relied primarily on inbred strains of mice whose adaptive immune system can differ substantially from that of humans. Moreover, the genetically induced hypercholesterolemia in these models typically results in plasma cholesterol levels that are much higher than those in most humans. To overcome these obstacles, we studied human immune system-reconstituted mice (hu-mice) rendered hypercholesterolemic by treatment with adeno-associated virus 8-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (AAV8-PCSK9) and a high-fat/high-cholesterol Western-type diet (WD). These mice had a high percentage of human T cells and moderate hypercholesterolemia. Compared with hu-mice that had lower plasma cholesterol, the PCSK9-WD mice developed a T cell-mediated inflammatory response in the lung and liver. Human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells bearing an effector memory phenotype were significantly elevated in the blood, spleen, and lungs of PCSK9-WD hu-mice, whereas splenic and circulating regulatory T cells were reduced. These data show that moderately high plasma cholesterol can disrupt human T cell homeostasis in vivo. This process may not only exacerbate atherosclerosis, but also contribute to T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases in the hypercholesterolemia setting.",

        "Abstract": "Cellular therapies with CD4+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) hold promise of efficacious treatment for the variety of autoimmune and allergic diseases as well as posttransplant complications. Nevertheless, current manufacturing of Tregs as a cellular medicinal product varies between different laboratories, which in turn hampers precise comparisons of the results between the studies performed. While the number of clinical trials testing Tregs is already substantial, it seems to be crucial to provide some standardized characteristics of Treg products in order to minimize the problem. We have previously developed reporting guidelines called minimum information about tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells, which allows the comparison between different preparations of tolerance-inducing antigen-presenting cells. Having this experience, here we describe another minimum information about Tregs (MITREG). It is important to note that MITREG does not dictate how investigators should generate or characterize Tregs, but it does require investigators to report their Treg data in a consistent and transparent manner. We hope this will, therefore, be a useful tool facilitating standardized reporting on the manufacturing of Tregs, either for research purposes or for clinical application. This way MITREG might also be an important step toward more standardized and reproducible testing of the Tregs preparations in clinical applications.",

        "Abstract": "B cells play a major role in antigen presentation and antibody production in the development of autoimmune diseases, and some of these diseases disproportionally occur in females. Moreover, immune responses tend to be stronger in female vs male humans and mice. Because it is challenging to distinguish intrinsic from extrinsic influences on human immune responses, we used a personalized immune (PI) humanized mouse model, in which immune systems were generated de novo from adult human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in immunodeficient mice. We assessed the effect of recipient sex and of donor autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes [T1D] and rheumatoid arthritis [RA]) on human B-cell development in PI mice. We observed that human B-cell levels were increased in female recipients regardless of the source of human HSCs or the strain of immunodeficient recipient mice. Moreover, mice injected with T1D- or RA-derived HSCs displayed B-cell abnormalities compared with healthy control HSC-derived mice, including altered B-cell levels, increased proportions of mature B cells and reduced CD19 expression. Our study revealed an HSC-extrinsic effect of recipient sex on human B-cell reconstitution. Moreover, the PI humanized mouse model revealed HSC-intrinsic defects in central B-cell tolerance that recapitulated those in patients with autoimmune diseases. These results demonstrate the utility of humanized mouse models as a tool to better understand human immune cell development and regulation.",

        "Abstract": "This review focuses on mechanistic studies performed in recipients of non-myeloablative bone marrow transplant regimens developed at Massachusetts General Hospital in HLA-identical and HLA-mismatched haploidentical combinations, initially as a platform for treatment of hematologic malignancies with immunotherapy in the form of donor leukocyte infusions, and later in combination with donor kidney transplantation for the induction of allograft tolerance. In patients with permanent mixed chimerism, central deletion may be a major mechanism of long-term tolerance. In patients in whom donor chimerism is only transient, the kidney itself plays a significant role in maintaining long-term tolerance. A high throughput sequencing approach to identifying and tracking a significant portion of the alloreactive T cell receptor repertoire has demonstrated biological significance in transplant patients and has been useful in pointing to clonal deletion as a long-term tolerance mechanism in recipients of HLA-mismatched combined kidney and bone marrow transplants with only transient chimerism.",

        "Abstract": "Cynomolgus monkeys are often used in preclinical transplantation research. Performing liver transplantation in cynomolgus monkeys is challenging because they poorly tolerate portal vein clamping during the anhepatic phase. Finding an alternative to portal vein clamping is necessary before preclinical liver transplant models can be performed with reliable outcomes. We used 3 different techniques to perform 5 liver transplants in male cynomolgus macaques (weight, 7.4-10.8 kg; mismatched for MHC I and II; matched for ABO). In procedure A, we clamped the portal vein briefly, as in human transplants, as well as the superior mesentery artery to minimize congestion at the expense of temporary ischemia (n = 2). In procedure B, we performed a temporary portocaval shunt with extracorporeal venovenous bypass (n = 1). For procedure C, we developed an H-shunt system (modified portocaval shunt) with extracorporeal bypass (n = 2). Postoperative immunosuppression comprised cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. Recipients in procedure A developed hemodynamic instability and were euthanized within 2 d. The recipient that underwent procedure B was euthanized within 11 d due to inferior vena caval thrombosis. The H-shunt in procedure C led to minimal PV congestion during the anhepatic phase, and both recipients reached the 21-d survival endpoint with good graft function. Our novel H-shunt bypass system resulted in successful liver transplantation in cynomolgus macaques, with long-term posttransplant survival possible. This technical innovation makes possible the use of cynomolgus monkeys for preclinical liver transplant tolerance models.",

        "Abstract": "\u03b2-Cells derived from stem cells hold great promise for cell replacement therapy for diabetes. Here we examine the ability of nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells (NT-ESs) derived from a patient with type 1 diabetes to differentiate into \u03b2-cells and provide a source of autologous islets for cell replacement. NT-ESs differentiate in vitro with an average efficiency of 55% into C-peptide-positive cells, expressing markers of mature \u03b2-cells, including MAFA and NKX6.1. Upon transplantation in immunodeficient mice, grafted cells form vascularized islet-like structures containing MAFA/C-peptide-positive cells. These \u03b2-cells adapt insulin secretion to ambient metabolite status and show normal insulin processing. Importantly, NT-ES-\u03b2-cells maintain normal blood glucose levels after ablation of the mouse endogenous \u03b2-cells. Cystic structures, but no teratomas, were observed in NT-ES-\u03b2-cell grafts. Isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell lines showed greater variability in \u03b2-cell differentiation. Even though different methods of somatic cell reprogramming result in stem cell lines that are molecularly indistinguishable, full differentiation competence is more common in ES cell lines than in induced pluripotent stem cell lines. These results demonstrate the suitability of NT-ES-\u03b2-cells for cell replacement for type 1 diabetes and provide proof of principle for therapeutic cloning combined with cell therapy.",

Improved models could identify which human T cells initiate and participate in beta-cell destruction and help define critical target islet autoantigens.

        "Abstract": "Immune responses to allografts represent a major barrier in organ transplantation. Immune tolerance to avoid chronic immunosuppression is a critical goal in the field, recently achieved in the clinic by combining bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with kidney transplantation following non-myeloablative conditioning. At high levels of chimerism such protocols can permit central deletional tolerance, but with a significant risk of graft-versus-host (GVH) disease (GVHD). By contrast, transient chimerism-based tolerance is devoid of GVHD risk and appears to initially depend on regulatory T cells (Tregs) followed by gradual, presumably peripheral, clonal deletion of donor-reactive T cells. Here we review recent mechanistic insights into tolerance and the development of more robust and safer protocols for tolerance induction that will be guided by innovative immune monitoring tools.",

        "Abstract": "Alloimmune T cells are central mediators of rejection and graft-versus-host disease in both solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Unique among immune responses in terms of its strength and diversity, the T cell alloresponse reflects extensive genetic polymorphisms between allogeneic donors and recipients, most prominently within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which encodes human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) in humans. The repertoire of alloreactive T cell clones is distinct for every donor-recipient pair and includes potentially thousands of unique HLA/peptide specificities. The extraordinary magnitude of the primary alloresponse and diversity of the T cell population mediating it have presented technical challenges to its study in humans. High-throughput T cell receptor sequencing approaches have opened up new possibilities for tackling many fundamental questions about this important immunologic phenomenon.",

However, the origin and specificity of allograft T cells over time has not been investigated in detail in animals or humans. Here, we use polychromatic flow cytometry and high throughput TCR sequencing of serial biopsies to show that gut-resident T cell turnover kinetics in human intestinal allografts are correlated with the balance between intra-graft host-vs-graft (HvG) and graft-vs-host (GvH) reactivities and with clinical outcomes. In the absence of rejection, donor T cells were enriched for GvH-reactive clones that persisted long-term in the graft. Early expansion of GvH clones in the graft correlated with rapid replacement of donor APCs by the recipient. Rejection was associated with transient infiltration by blood-like recipient CD28+ NKG2D",

        "Abstract": "The currently available human tumor xenograft models permit modeling of human cancers in vivo, but in immunocompromised hosts. Here we report a humanized mouse (hu-mouse) model made by transplantation of human fetal thymic tissue plus hematopoietic stem cells transduced with a leukemia-associated fusion gene MLL-AF9. In addition to normal human lymphohematopoietic reconstitution as seen in non-leukemic hu-mice, these hu-mice showed spontaneous development of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), which was transplantable to secondary recipients with an autologous human immune system. Using this model, we show that lymphopenia markedly improves the antitumor efficacy of recipient leukocyte infusion (RLI), a GVHD-free immunotherapy that induces antitumor responses in association with rejection of donor chimerism in mixed allogeneic chimeras. Our data demonstrate the potential of this leukemic hu-mouse model in modeling leukemia immunotherapy, and suggest that RLI may offer a safe treatment option for leukemia patients with severe lymphopenia.",

        "Abstract": "Alloreactive T lymphocytes are the primary mediators of allograft rejection. The size and diversity of the HLA-alloreactive T cell repertoire has thus far precluded the ability to follow these T cells and thereby to understand their fate in human transplant recipients. This review summarizes the history, challenges, and recent advances in the study of alloreactive T cells. We highlight the historical development of assays to measure alloreactivity and discuss how high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing-based assays can provide a new window into the fate of alloreactive T cells in human transplant recipients. A specific approach combining a classical in vitro assay, the mixed lymphocyte reaction, with deep T cell receptor sequencing is described as a tool to track the donor-reactive T cell repertoire for any specific HLA-mismatched donor-recipient pair. This assay can provide mechanistic insights and has potential as a noninvasive, highly specific biomarker for rejection and tolerance.",

        "Abstract": "NK cells resist engraftment of syngeneic and allogeneic bone marrow (BM) cells lacking major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules, suggesting a critical role for donor MHC class I molecules in preventing NK cell attack against donor hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), and their derivatives. However, using high-resolution in vivo imaging, we demonstrated here that syngeneic MHC class I knockout (KO) donor HSPCs persist with the same survival frequencies as wild-type donor HSPCs. In contrast, syngeneic MHC class I KO differentiated hematopoietic cells and allogeneic MHC class I KO HSPCs were rejected in a manner that was significantly inhibited by NK cell depletion. In vivo time-lapse imaging demonstrated that mice receiving allogeneic MHC class I KO HSPCs showed a significant increase in NK cell motility and proliferation as well as frequencies of NK cell contact with and killing of HSPCs as compared to mice receiving wild-type HSPCs. The data indicate that donor MHC class I molecules are required to prevent NK cell-mediated rejection of syngeneic differentiated cells and allogeneic HSPCs, but not of syngeneic HSPCs.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammation in the priming host environment has critical effects on the graft-versus-host (GVH) responses mediated by naive donor T cells. However, it is unclear how a quiescent or inflammatory environment impacts the activity of GVH-reactive primed T and memory cells. We show in this article that GVH-reactive primed donor T cells generated in irradiated recipients had diminished ability compared with naive T cells to increase donor chimerism when transferred to quiescent mixed allogeneic chimeras. GVH-reactive primed T cells showed marked loss of cytotoxic function and activation, and delayed but not decreased proliferation or accumulation in lymphoid tissues when transferred to quiescent mixed chimeras compared with freshly irradiated secondary recipients. Primed CD4 and CD8 T cells provided mutual help to sustain these functions in both subsets. CD8 help for CD4 cells was largely IFN-\u03b3 dependent. TLR stimulation after transfer of GVH-reactive primed T cells to mixed chimeras restored their cytotoxic effector function and permitted the generation of more effective T cell memory in association with reduced PD-1 expression on CD4 memory cells. Our data indicate that an inflammatory host environment is required for the maintenance of GVH-reactive primed T cell functions and the generation of memory T cells that can rapidly acquire effector functions. These findings have important implications for graft-versus-host disease and T cell-mediated immunotherapies.",

        "Abstract": "T cell responses to allogeneic major histocompatibility complex antigens present a formidable barrier to organ transplantation, necessitating long-term immunosuppression to minimize rejection. Chronic rejection and drug-induced morbidities are major limitations that could be overcome by allograft tolerance induction. Tolerance was first intentionally induced in humans via combined kidney and bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT), but the mechanisms of tolerance in these patients are incompletely understood. We now establish an assay to identify donor-reactive T cells and test the role of deletion in tolerance after CKBMT. Using high-throughput sequencing of the T cell receptor B chain CDR3 region, we define a fingerprint of the donor-reactive T cell repertoire before transplantation and track those clones after transplant. We observed posttransplant reductions in donor-reactive T cell clones in three tolerant CKBMT patients; such reductions were not observed in a fourth, nontolerant, CKBMT patient or in two conventional kidney transplant recipients on standard immunosuppressive regimens. T cell repertoire turnover due to lymphocyte-depleting conditioning only partially accounted for the observed reductions in tolerant patients; in fact, conventional transplant recipients showed expansion of circulating donor-reactive clones, despite extensive repertoire turnover. Moreover, loss of donor-reactive T cell clones more closely associated with tolerance induction than in vitro functional assays. Our analysis supports clonal deletion as a mechanism of allograft tolerance in CKBMT patients. The results validate the contribution of donor-reactive T cell clones identified before transplant by our method, supporting further exploration as a potential biomarker of transplant outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Exhaustion of chronically stimulated CD8(+) T cells is a significant obstacle to immune control of chronic infections or tumors. Although coinhibitory checkpoint blockade with anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) Ab can restore functions to exhausted T cell populations, recovery is often incomplete and dependent upon the pool size of a quiescent T-bet(high) subset that expresses lower levels of PD-1. In a model in which unhelped, HY-specific CD8(+) T cells gradually lose function following transfer to male bone marrow transplantation recipients, we have explored the effect of shifting the balance away from coinhibition and toward costimulation by combining anti-PD-L1 with agonistic Abs to the TNFR superfamily members, OX40 and CD27. Several weeks following T cell transfer, both agonistic Abs, but especially anti-CD27, demonstrated synergy with anti-PD-L1 by enhancing CD8(+) T cell proliferation and effector cytokine generation. Anti-CD27 and anti-PD-L1 synergized by downregulating the expression of multiple quiescence-related genes concomitant with a reduced frequency of T-bet(high) cells within the exhausted population. However, in the presence of persistent Ag, the CD8(+) T cell response was not sustained and the overall size of the effector cytokine-producing pool eventually contracted to levels below that of controls. Thus, CD27-mediated costimulation can synergize with coinhibitory checkpoint blockade to switch off molecular programs for quiescence in exhausted T cell populations, but at the expense of losing precursor cells required to maintain a response.",

        "Abstract": "Transplantation of xenogeneic thymus tissue allows xenograft tolerance induction in the highly disparate pig-to-mouse model. Fetal swine thymus (SW THY) can support the generation of a diverse human T cell repertoire that is tolerant of the pig in vitro. We demonstrate that SW THY generates all human T cell subsets, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), in similar numbers as fetal human thymus (HU THY) grafts in immunodeficient mice receiving the same human CD34(+) cells. Peripheral T cells are specifically tolerant to the mouse and to the human and porcine donors, with robust responses to nondonor human and pig Ags. Specific tolerance is observed to pig skin grafts sharing the THY donor MHC. SW THY-generated peripheral Tregs show similar function, but include lower percentages of naive-type Tregs compared with HU THY-generated Tregs. Tregs contribute to donor-pig specific tolerance. Peripheral human T cells generated in SW THY exhibit reduced proportions of CD8(+) T cells and reduced lymphopenia-driven proliferation and memory-type conversion, accelerated decay of memory-type cells, and reduced responses to protein Ags. Thus, SW thymus transplantation is a powerful xenotolerance approach for human T cells. However, immune function may be further enhanced by strategies to permit positive selection by autologous HLA molecules.",

        "Abstract": "The discrepancy between organ need and organ availability represents one of the major limitations in the field of transplantation. One possible solution to this problem is xenotransplantation. Research in this field has identified several obstacles that have so far prevented the successful development of clinical xenotransplantation protocols. The main immunologic barriers include strong T-cell and B-cell responses to solid organ and cellular xenografts. In addition, components of the innate immune system can mediate xenograft rejection. Here, we review these immunologic and physiologic barriers and describe some of the strategies that we and others have developed to overcome them. We also describe the development of two strategies to induce tolerance across the xenogeneic barrier, namely thymus transplantation and mixed chimerism, from their inception in rodent models through their current progress in preclinical large animal models. We believe that the addition of further beneficial transgenes to Gal knockout swine, combined with new therapies such as Treg administration, will allow for successful clinical application of xenotransplantation.",

This state is usually attained through either bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Although numerous treatment regimens have led to transplantation tolerance in mice, the induction of mixed chimerism is currently the only treatment modality that has been successfully extended to large animals and to the clinic. Here we describe and compare the use of mixed chimerism to establish transplantation tolerance in mice, pigs, monkeys, and in the clinic. We also attempt to correlate the mechanisms involved in achieving tolerance with the nature of the tolerance that has resulted in each case.",

        "Abstract": "The Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC) is a network of 33 centers in North America that study the treatment of rare and severe primary immunodeficiency diseases. Current protocols address the natural history of patients treated for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and chronic granulomatous disease through retrospective, prospective, and cross-sectional studies. The PIDTC additionally seeks to encourage training of junior investigators, establish partnerships with European and other International colleagues, work with patient advocacy groups to promote community awareness, and conduct pilot demonstration projects. Future goals include the conduct of prospective treatment studies to determine optimal therapies for primary immunodeficiency diseases. To date, the PIDTC has funded 2 pilot projects: newborn screening for SCID in Navajo Native Americans and B-cell reconstitution in patients with SCID after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Ten junior investigators have received grant awards. The PIDTC Annual Scientific Workshop has brought together consortium members, outside speakers, patient advocacy groups, and young investigators and trainees to report progress of the protocols and discuss common interests and goals, including new scientific developments and future directions of clinical research. Here we report the progress of the PIDTC to date, highlights of the first 2\u00a0PIDTC workshops, and consideration of future consortium objectives.",

        "Title": "Clinical strategy for induction of transplantation tolerance through mixed chimerism.",
        "Abstract": "Following the demonstration that transplant tolerance could be induced in non-human primate recipients treated with non-myeloablative conditioning that resulted in only transient chimerism, we began in 1998 to evaluate this approach first in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD), secondary to multiple myeloma (MM). A total of 10 patients with ESRD and MM have been treated with this initial protocol. Only 2 recipients developed evidence of reversible renal allograft rejection after stopping immunosuppression. Long-term (up to 14 years) operational renal allograft tolerance has been observed in all 10 patients, even in those with transient hematopoietic chimerism. Control of the MM has been less complete, as recurrent disease developed in five of these patients, three of whom expired. Nevertheless, in view of the essentially 100% 3-5 year mortality typically expected with alternative treatments for this challenging population, it has been suggested that combined kidney and donor bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT) following non-myeloablative conditioning should become the standard therapy for patients with ESRD secondary to MM (27). These encouraging results, as well as the acceptable morbidity observed in cancer patients receiving non-myeloablative human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched bone marrow transplantation in our center, led us to next evaluate CKBMT in 10 patients of HLA-mismatched transplants. All 10 subjects developed transient chimerism and in seven of these, immunosuppression was successfully discontinued. Four subjects continue to be immunosuppression free for periods of 4.5-11 years, while in three, reinstitution of immunosuppression was advised or accomplished after 5-8 years due to recurrence of original disease or chronic antibody mediated rejection. Donor-specific antibodies were frequently detectable in the earlier recipients. In contrast, no donor-specific antibodies were detected after immunosuppression was discontinued in the last four subjects, who showed more consistent and durable B-cell depletion. In conclusion, our studies have shown that immunosuppression-free renal allograft survival can be achieved in both HLAmatched and mismatched donor-recipient pairs, with follow up times now of greater than 14 years after induction of transient chimerism through CKBMT.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge of human T\u00a0cells derives chiefly from studies of peripheral blood, whereas their distribution and function in tissues remains largely unknown. Here, we present a unique analysis of human T\u00a0cells in lymphoid and mucosal tissues obtained from individual organ donors, revealing tissue-intrinsic compartmentalization of naive, effector, and memory subsets conserved between diverse individuals. Effector memory CD4(+) T\u00a0cells producing IL-2 predominated in mucosal tissues and accumulated as central memory subsets in lymphoid tissue, whereas CD8(+) T\u00a0cells were maintained as naive subsets in\u00a0lymphoid tissues and IFN-\u03b3-producing effector memory CD8(+) T\u00a0cells in mucosal sites. The T\u00a0cell activation marker CD69 was constitutively expressed by memory T\u00a0cells in all tissues, distinguishing them from circulating subsets, with mucosal memory T\u00a0cells exhibiting additional distinct phenotypic and functional properties. Our results provide an assessment of human T\u00a0cell compartmentalization as a new baseline for understanding human adaptive immunity.",

        "Abstract": "In mice, graft-versus-host reactions, associated with powerful graft-versus-tumor effects, can be achieved without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) by delayed administration of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) to established mixed chimeras. However, GVHD sometimes occurs after DLI in established mixed chimeric patients. In contrast to mice, in which T cell recovery from the thymus occurs prior to DLI administration, human T cell reconstitution following T cell-depleted hematopoietic cell transplantation is slow, resulting in lymphopenia at the time of DLI. We demonstrate in this study that T cell lymphopenia is an independent risk factor for GVHD following DLI in the absence of known inflammatory stimuli. DLI-induced GVHD was prevented in lymphopenic recipients by prior administration of a small number of nonalloreactive polyclonal T cells, insufficient to prevent lymphopenia-associated expansion of subsequently administered T cells, through a regulatory T cell-independent mechanism. GVHD was not inhibited by T cells with irrelevant specificity. Moreover, administration of antibiotics reduced the severity of GVHD in lymphopenic hosts. Accumulation of DLI-derived effector T cells and host hematopoietic cell elimination were markedly diminished by regulatory T cell-depleted, nonalloreactive T cells. Finally, thymectomized mixed chimeras showed increased GVHD following delayed DLI. Collectively, our data demonstrate that in the absence of known conditioning-induced inflammatory stimuli, T cell lymphopenia is a risk factor for GVHD in mixed chimeras receiving delayed DLI. Our data suggest that the predisposition to GVHD can at least in part be explained by the presence of occult inflammatory stimuli due to the absence of T cells to control microbial infections.",

        "Abstract": "Delayed administration of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) to established mixed chimeras has been shown to achieve anti-tumor responses without graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). Herein we show that de novo donor BM-derived T cells that are tolerant of the recipients are important in preventing GVHD in mixed chimeras receiving delayed DLI. Mixed chimeras lacking donor BM-derived T cells developed significantly more severe GVHD than those with donor BM-derived T cells after DLI, even though both groups had comparable levels of total T cells at the time of DLI. Post-DLI depletion of donor BM-derived T cells in mixed chimeras, as late as 20 days after DLI, also provoked severe GVHD. Although both CD4 and CD8 T cells contributed to the protection, the latter were significantly more effective, suggesting that inhibition of GVHD was not mainly mediated by CD4 regulatory T cells. The lack of donor BM-derived T cells was associated with markedly increased accumulation of DLI-derived alloreactive T cells in parenchymal GVHD target tissues. Thus, donor BM-derived T cells are an important factor in determining the risk of GVHD and therefore, offer a potential therapeutic target for preventing and ameliorating GVHD in the setting of delayed DLI in established mixed chimeras.",

        "Abstract": "The pathways regulating immunological tolerance are complex and overlapping. Here, we comment on our findings that the PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3 and TGF\u03b2 inhibitory molecules are all involved in mediating peripheral CD8 T\u2011cell tolerance induced by anti-CD40L and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in mice. These observations suggest the possibility of targeted manipulation of these pathways for induction of mixed hematopoietic chimerism for donor-specific transplantation tolerance.",

        "Abstract": "Studies of human immune diseases are generally limited to the analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes of heterogeneous patient populations. Improved models are needed to allow analysis of fundamental immunologic abnormalities predisposing to disease and in which to assess immunotherapies. Immunodeficient mice receiving human fetal thymus grafts and fetal CD34(+) cells intravenously produce robust human immune systems, allowing analysis of human T cell development and function. However, to use humanized mice to study human immune-mediated disorders, immune systems must be generated from adult hematopoietic cells. Here, we demonstrated robust immune reconstitution in mice with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) aspirated from bone marrow of adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and healthy control volunteers. In these humanized mice, cryopreservation of human leukocyte antigen allele-matched fetal thymic tissue prevented allogeneic adult HSC rejection. Newly generated T cells, which included regulatory T cells (T(regs)), were functional and self-tolerant and had a diverse repertoire. The immune recognition of these mice mimicked that of the adult CD34(+) cell donor, but the T cell phenotypes were more predominantly \"na\u00efve\" than those of the adult donors. HSCs from T1D and control donors generated similar numbers of natural T(regs) intrathymically; however, peripheral T cells from T1D subjects showed increased proportions of activated or memory cells compared to controls, suggesting possible HSC-intrinsic differences in T cell homeostasis that might underlie immune pathology in T1D. This \"personalized immune\" mouse provides a new model for individualized analysis of human immune responses that may provide new insights into not only T1D but also other forms of immune function and dysfunction as well.",

        "Abstract": "CD4(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) control adaptive immune responses and promote self-tolerance. Various humanized mouse models have been developed in efforts to reproduce and study a human immune system. However, in models that require T cell differentiation in the recipient murine thymus, only low numbers of T cells populate the peripheral immune systems. T cells are positively selected by mouse MHC and therefore do not function well in an HLA-restricted manner. In contrast, cotransplantation of human fetal thymus/liver and i.v. injection of CD34(+) cells from the same donor achieves multilineage human lymphohematopoietic reconstitution, including dendritic cells and formation of secondary lymphoid organs, in NOD/SCID mice. Strong Ag-specific immune responses and homeostatic expansion of human T cells that are dependent on peripheral human APCs occur. We now demonstrate that FOXP3(+)Helios(+) \"natural\" Tregs develop normally in human fetal thymic grafts and are present in peripheral blood, spleen, and lymph nodes of these humanized mice. Humanized mice exhibit normal reversal of CD45 isoform expression in association with thymic egress, postthymic \"naive\" to \"activated\" phenotypic conversion, and suppressive function. These studies demonstrate the utility of this humanized mouse model for the study of human Treg ontogeny, immunobiology and therapy.",

        "Abstract": "The induction of transplantation tolerance could liberate organ transplant recipients from the complications of life-long chronic immunosuppression. The original description of tolerance induction through mixed hematopoietic chimerism in mice utilized lethal whole body irradiation as the preparative regimen for achieving mixed chimerism. While such a regimen might be acceptable for treatment of patients with malignancies, which might also respond to the therapeutic effects of radiation, its toxicity would be unacceptable for patients in need only of an organ transplant. Graft-vs.-host disease, which is frequently a complication of mismatched bone marrow transplantation, would likewise be unacceptable for ordinary clinical transplantation. Therefore, as we have extended the use of this modality for tolerance induction from mice to large animal models, we have attempted to design preparative regimens that avoid both of these complications. In this article, we review our studies of mixed chimerism in mice, miniature swine and monkeys, as well as the results of our recent clinical studies that have extended this treatment modality to a series of kidney transplant patients who have been successfully weaned from all immunosuppression while maintaining stable renal function for up to 8 years.",

        "Abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has most commonly been used to treat hematologic malignancies, where it is often the only potentially curative option available. The success of HCT has been limited by transplant-associated toxicities related to the conditioning regimens used and to the common immunologic consequence of donor T cell recognition of recipient alloantigens, graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). The frequency and severity of GVHD observed when extensive HLA barriers are transgressed has essentially precluded the routine use of extensively HLA-mismatched HCT. Allogeneic HCT also has potential as an approach to organ allograft tolerance induction, but this potential has not been previously realized because of the toxicity associated with traditional conditioning. In this paper we review two approaches to HCT involving reduced intensity conditioning regimens that have been associated with improvements in safety in patients with hematologic malignancies, even in the HLA-mismatched transplant setting. These strategies have been applied in the first successful pilot studies for the induction of organ allograft tolerance in humans. Thus, we summarize an example of vertical translational research between animal models and humans and horizontal translation between two separate goals that culminated in the use of HCT to achieve allograft tolerance in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Stem cells reside in a specialized regulatory microenvironment or niche, where they receive appropriate support for maintaining self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capacity. The niche may also protect stem cells from environmental insults including cytotoxic chemotherapy and perhaps pathogenic immunity. The testis, hair follicle and placenta are all sites of residence for stem cells and are immune-suppressive environments, called immune-privileged sites, where multiple mechanisms cooperate to prevent immune attack, even enabling prolonged survival of foreign allografts without immunosuppression. We sought to determine if somatic stem-cell niches more broadly are immune-privileged sites by examining the haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) niche in the bone marrow, a site where immune reactivity exists. We observed persistence of HSPCs from allogeneic donor mice (allo-HSPCs) in non-irradiated recipient mice for 30\u2009days without immunosuppression with the same survival frequency compared to syngeneic HSPCs. These HSPCs were lost after the depletion of FoxP3 regulatory T (T(reg)) cells. High-resolution in vivo imaging over time demonstrated marked co-localization of HSPCs with T(reg) cells that accumulated on the endosteal surface in the calvarial and trabecular bone marrow. T(reg) cells seem to participate in creating a localized zone where HSPCs reside and where T(reg) cells are necessary for allo-HSPC persistence. In addition to processes supporting stem-cell function, the niche will provide a relative sanctuary from immune attack.",

        "Abstract": "Administration of a single dose of anti-CD40L mAb at the time of allogeneic BM transplantation tolerizes peripheral alloreactive T cells and permits establishment of mixed hematopoietic chimerism in mice. Once engrafted, mixed chimeras are systemically tolerant to donor Ags through a central deletion mechanism and will accept any donor organ indefinitely. We previously found that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is required for CD8 T-cell tolerance in this model. However, the cell population that must express PD-1 and the role of other inhibitory molecules were unknown. Here, we report that LAG-3 is required for long-term peripheral CD8 but not CD4 T-cell tolerance and that this requirement is CD8 cell-extrinsic. In contrast, adoptive transfer studies revealed a CD8 T cell-intrinsic requirement for CTLA4/B7.1/B7.2 and for PD-1 for CD8 T-cell tolerance induction. We also observed that both PD-L1 and PD-L2 are independently required on donor cells to achieve T-cell tolerance. Finally, we uncovered a requirement for TGF-\u03b2 signaling into T cells to achieve peripheral CD8 but not CD4 T-cell tolerance in this in vivo system.",

The availability of recombinant CD40L with high binding capacity for MR1 would provide a valuable immunologic research tool. In this study, we constructed the single chain murine soluble CD40L monomer, dimer, trimer and successfully expressed them in yeast Pichia pastoris under the control of the alcohol oxidase promoter. The secreted single chain murine soluble CD40L monomers, dimers, and trimers were initially enriched through histidine tag capture by Ni-Sepharose 6 fast flow resin and further purified on a cation exchange resin. Purity reached more than 95% for the monomer and dimer forms and more than 90% for the trimer. Protein yield following purification was 16 mg/L for the monomer and dimer, and 8 mg/L for the trimer. ELISA analysis demonstrated that the CD40L dimers and trimers correctly folded in conformations exposing the MR1 antigenic determinant.",

        "Abstract": "Allogeneic blood or BM transplantation (BMT) is the most commonly applied form of adoptive cellular therapy for cancer. In this context, the ability of donor T cells to respond to recipient antigens is coopted to generate graft-versus-tumor (GVT) responses. The major reason for treatment failure is tumor recurrence, which is linked to the eventual loss of functional, host-specific CTLs. In this study, we have explored the role of recipient antigen expression by nonhematopoietic cells in the failure to sustain effective CTL immunity. Using clinically relevant models, we found that nonhematopoietic antigen severely disrupts the formation of donor CD8+ T cell memory at 2 distinct levels that operate in the early and late phases of the response. First, initial and direct encounters between donor CD8+ T cells and nonhematopoietic cells blocked the programming of memory precursors essential for establishing recall immunity. Second, surviving CD8+ T cells became functionally exhausted with heightened expression of the coinhibitory receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1). These 2 factors acted together to induce even more profound failure in long-term immunosurveillance. Crucially, the functions of exhausted CD8+ T cells could be partially restored by late in vivo blockade of the interaction between PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1, without induction of graft-versus-host disease, suggestive of a potential clinical strategy to prevent or treat relapse following allogeneic BMT.",

        "Title": "Invariant NKT cells are required for antitumor responses induced by host-versus-graft responses.",
        "Abstract": "Based on clinical observations, we have previously shown in a murine model that recipient leukocyte infusion (RLI) induces a host-versus-graft reaction in mixed bone marrow chimeras and that rejection of donor cells leads to a specific antitumor response against recipient malignancies. This response is dependent on T cells and IFN-gamma. We investigated the role of NKT cells (NKTs) in this phenomenon. Depletion of recipient NK1.1(+) cells led to loss of an anti-tumor effect induced by RLI in mixed bone marrow chimeras. In recipients specifically lacking host invariant NKT cells (iNKTs), RLI did not induce an antitumor effect, indicating a critical role for recipient iNKTs. Conversely, specific activation of iNKTs enhanced the anti-tumor effect induced by RLI. Following RLI, recipient iNKTs, NK cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and CD8 T cells were activated. CD8 T cells were the major producers of IFN-gamma. Lack of recipient iNKTs resulted in failure of activation of NK cells and DCs by RLI. Our studies demonstrate a central role for iNKTs in promoting RLI-induced anti-tumor effects and suggest that this pathway involved promotion of the activation of recipient NK cells and DCs.",

        "Abstract": "Immune recovery in lymphopenic hosts depends largely on homeostatic peripheral expansion, especially when thymopoiesis is insufficient, as is often the case in human adults. Although it has been well studied in mice, the study of homeostatic peripheral expansion of human T cells has been limited by the lack of an appropriate in vivo model. In this study, we use T cell-deficient humanized mice and an adoptive transfer approach to demonstrate that two distinct proliferative responses of autologous T cells occur in vivo in a lymphopenic setting. Human naive CD4 and CD8 T cells that undergo rapid proliferation acquire a memory-like phenotype and the ability to rapidly produce IFN-gamma, whereas those undergoing slow proliferation retain naive phenotypic and functional characteristics. Recovery of both populations depends on the extent of human non-T cell chimerism in the periphery of recipient humanized mice. Furthermore, memory conversion of CD4 and CD8 T cells correlates with the level of human CD14+ and CD19+ chimerism in recipient mice, respectively, suggesting that different types of APCs support memory conversion of CD4 and CD8 T cells. Because lymphopenia affects clinical outcomes, this model, which will allow detailed investigation of the effects of lymphopenia in patients, is of clinical significance.",

        "Title": "A CD8 T cell-intrinsic role for the calcineurin-NFAT pathway for tolerance induction in vivo.",
        "Abstract": "Previous studies have indicated that blockade of signaling through the T-cell receptor (TCR)/calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway impairs transplantation tolerance induced with anti-CD154 antibody. By using an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation model, we examined the role of the TCR/calcineurin/NFAT pathway for tolerance induction with anti-CD154. Calcineurin blockade by cyclosporine A led to a failure of CD8 but not CD4 tolerance, and experiments in NFAT1(-/-) mice replicated this effect. Studies in thymectomized mice demonstrated that blockade of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway after bone marrow transplantation led to a failure of peripheral CD8 tolerance. Moreover, CD8 adoptive transfer studies demonstrated that NFAT1 is cell-intrinsically required for peripheral CD8 tolerance. NFAT1 deficiency did not impair CD8 T-cell up-regulation of PD1, which is required for CD8 tolerance in this model. NFAT1 has previously been shown to have a role in CD4 cells for anergy induction and for programming CD4 cells to become regulatory cells. By generating mice lacking NFAT1 in CD4 but not CD8 cells, we demonstrate that NFAT1 is neither required for CD4 tolerance induction nor for their regulatory function on CD8 T cells. Thus, our study reveals a CD8 T cell-intrinsic NFAT1 requirement for CD8 tolerance in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "The outstanding results recently obtained in islet xenotransplantation suggest that porcine islet clinical trials may soon be scientifically appropriate. Before the initiation of such clinical studies, however, it is essential that a series of key ethical and regulatory conditions are satisfied. As far as ethics is concerned, the fundamental requirements have been previously reported in a position paper of the Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association. These include aspects related to the selection of adequately informed, appropriate recipients; animal breeding and welfare; safety issues and the need for a favorable risk/benefit assessment based on strong efficacy data in relevant xenotransplantation studies in the primate. As most diabetic patients are not at risk of short-term mortality without islet transplantation, only a small subset of patients could currently be considered for any type of islet transplant. However, there are potential advantages to xenotransplantation that could result in a favorable benefit-over-harm determination for islet xenotransplantation in this subpopulation and ultimately in a broader population of diabetic patients. With regard to regulatory aspects, the key concepts underlying the development of the regulatory models in existence in the United States, Europe and New Zealand are discussed. Each of these models provides an example of a well-defined regulatory approach to ensure the initiation of well-regulated and ethically acceptable clinical islet xenotransplantation trials. At this stage, it becomes apparent that only a well-coordinated international effort such as that initiated by the World Health Organization, aimed at harmonizing xenotransplantation procedures according to the highest ethical and regulatory standards on a global scale, will enable the initiation of clinical xenotransplantation trials under the best auspices for its success and minimize any risk of failure.",

        "Title": "Induction of robust cellular and humoral virus-specific adaptive immune responses in human immunodeficiency virus-infected humanized BLT mice.",
        "Abstract": "The generation of humanized BLT mice by the cotransplantation of human fetal thymus and liver tissues and CD34(+) fetal liver cells into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice allows for the long-term reconstitution of a functional human immune system, with human T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes/macrophages repopulating mouse tissues. Here, we show that humanized BLT mice sustained high-level disseminated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, resulting in CD4(+) T-cell depletion and generalized immune activation. Following infection, HIV-specific humoral responses were present in all mice by 3 months, and HIV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses were detected in the majority of mice tested after 9 weeks of infection. Despite robust HIV-specific responses, however, viral loads remained elevated in infected BLT mice, raising the possibility that these responses are dysfunctional. The increased T-cell expression of the negative costimulator PD-1 recently has been postulated to contribute to T-cell dysfunction in chronic HIV infection. As seen in human infection, both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells demonstrated increased PD-1 expression in HIV-infected BLT mice, and PD-1 levels in these cells correlated positively with viral load and inversely with CD4(+) cell levels. The ability of humanized BLT mice to generate both cellular and humoral immune responses to HIV will allow the further investigation of human HIV-specific immune responses in vivo and suggests that these mice are able to provide a platform to assess candidate HIV vaccines and other immunotherapeutic strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) inhibits graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in lethally irradiated mice receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) but promotes lethality in unirradiated and sublethally irradiated recipients. We investigated the role of IFN-gamma in GVHD in sublethally irradiated B6D2F1 recipients of B6 allo-HCT. B6D2F1 mice receiving wild-type B6 splenocytes alone died rapidly, whereas those receiving wild-type B6 splenocytes plus marrow survived long-term. Mice in both groups showed rapid elimination of host hematopoietic cells but minimal parenchymal tissue injury. However, mice receiving allo-HCT from IFN-gamma-deficient donors died rapidly regardless of whether donor marrow was given, and they exhibited severe parenchymal injury but prolonged survival of host hematopoietic cells. IFN-gamma plays a similar role in another model involving delayed B6 donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) to established mixed allogeneic (B6-->BALB/c) chimeras. IFN-gamma promotes DLI-mediated conversion from mixed to full donor chimerism while attenuating GVHD. Importantly, IFN-gamma enhances graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects in both models. Our data indicate that previously reported IFN-gamma-induced early mortality in allo-HCT recipients is due to augmentation of lymphohematopoietic graft-versus-host reaction (LGVHR) and can be avoided by providing an adequate source of donor hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Furthermore, the magnitude of GVL is correlated with the strength of LGVHR, and IFN-gamma reduces the potential of this alloreactivity to cause epithelial tissue GVHD.",

A large number of approaches to tolerance induction have been described in the experimental literature, but only hematopoietic cell transplantation has shown preliminary success for intentional tolerance induction in pilot clinical trials. This review summarizes the conditions that allow progress to be made in moving strategies for tolerance induction from the bench to the bedside and discuss the mechanisms by which tolerance may be achieved through hematopoietic cell transplantation.",

        "Abstract": "Although the inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 (CD152) has been implicated in peripheral CD4 T-cell tolerance, its mechanism of action remains poorly defined. We analyzed mechanisms of CD4 cell tolerance in a model of tolerance induction involving establishment of mixed hematopoietic chimerism in recipients of fully MHC-mismatched allogeneic bone marrow cells with anti-CD154 mAb. Animals lacking CD80 and CD86 failed to achieve chimerism. We detected no T cell-intrinsic requirement for CD28 for chimerism induction. However, a CD4 T cell-intrinsic signal through CTLA-4 was shown to be essential within the first 48 hours of exposure to alloantigen for the establishment of tolerance and mixed chimerism. This signal must be provided by a recipient CD80/86(+) non-T-cell population. Donor CD80/86 expression was insufficient to achieve tolerance. Together, our findings demonstrate a surprising role for interactions of CTLA-4 expressed by alloreactive peripheral CD4 T cells with CD80/86 on recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the induction of early tolerance, suggesting a 3-cell tolerance model involving directly alloreactive CD4 cells, donor antigen-expressing bone marrow cells, and recipient antigen-presenting cells. This tolerance is independent of regulatory T cells and culminates in the deletion of directly alloreactive CD4 T cells.",

Tolerance approaches to xenotransplantation would overcome this concern. Studies in humanized mouse models have demonstrated that human T cells can be tolerized to porcine xenografts, providing important proofs of principle of the potential feasibility of pig-to-primate xenograft tolerance. The results available from studies of pig-to-primate xenotransplantation to date have demonstrated that while chronic immunosuppressive drugs have not completely avoided either T cell responses or humoral rejection, approaches directed toward tolerance induction have been encouraging with regard to avoiding immunization at both of these levels.",

        "Title": "Abnormal regulatory and effector T cell function predispose to autoimmunity following xenogeneic thymic transplantation.",
        "Abstract": "Porcine thymus grafts support robust murine and human thymopoiesis, generating a diverse T cell repertoire that is deleted of donor and host-reactive cells, achieving specific xenograft tolerance. Positive selection is mediated exclusively by the xenogeneic thymic MHC. Although thymectomized, T cell-depleted normal mice usually remain healthy following xenogeneic thymic transplantation, thymus-grafted congenitally athymic mice frequently develop multiorgan autoimmunity. We investigated the etiology of this syndrome by adoptively transferring lymphocyte populations from fetal pig thymus-grafted BALB/c nude mice to secondary BALB/c nude recipients. Fetal pig thymus-grafted nude mice generated normal numbers of CD25(+)Foxp3(+)CD4 T cells, but these cells lacked the capacity to block autoimmunity. Moreover, thymocytes and peripheral CD4(+)CD25(-) cells from fetal pig thymus-grafted nude mice, but not those from normal mice, induced autoimmunity in nude recipients. Injection of thymic epithelial cells from normal BALB/c mice into fetal pig thymus grafts reduced autoimmunity and enhanced regulatory function of splenocytes. Our data implicate abnormalities in postthymic maturation, expansion, and/or survival of T cells positively selected by a xenogeneic MHC, as well as incomplete intrathymic deletion of thymocytes recognizing host tissue-specific Ags, in autoimmune pathogenesis. Regulatory cell function is enhanced and negative selection of host-specific thymocytes may potentially also be improved by coimplantation of recipient thymic epithelial cells in the thymus xenograft.",

        "Abstract": "We have examined how the host environment influences the graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) response following transfer of donor T cells to allogeneic chimeras. Donor T cells induce significant GVL when administered in large numbers to established mixed chimeras (MC). However, when using limiting numbers of T cells, we found that late transfer to MC induced less GVL than did early transfer to freshly irradiated allogeneic recipients. Late donor T cell transfer to MC was associated with marked accumulation of anti-host CD8 cells within the spleen, but delayed kinetics of differentiation, reduced expression of effector molecules including IFN-gamma, impaired cytotoxicity, and higher rates of sustained apoptosis. Furthermore, in contrast to the spleen, we observed a significant delay in donor CD8 cell recruitment to the bone marrow, a key location for hematopoietic tumors. Increasing the numbers of T cells transferred to MC led to the enhancement of CTL activity and detectable increases in absolute numbers of IFN-gamma(+) cells without inducing graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). TLR-induced systemic inflammation accelerated differentiation of functional CTL in MC but was associated with severe GVHD. In the absence of inflammation, both recipient T and non-T cell populations impeded the full development of GVHD-inducing effector function. We conclude that per-cell deficits in the function of donor CD8 cells activated in MC may be overcome by transferring larger numbers of T cells without inducing GVHD.",

        "Title": "Clinical experience with mixed chimerism to induce transplantation tolerance.",
        "Abstract": "Lymphohematopoietic chimerism was first shown to be associated with donor-specific allograft tolerance more than 60 years ago. However, early clinical experience with bone marrow transplantation soon revealed that conventional, myeloablative approaches were far too toxic and the risk of graft-versus-host disease too great to justify using this technology for the purpose of organ allograft tolerance induction in the absence of malignant disease. In this review, we discuss a step-wise approach that has been applied by several centers to establish less toxic approaches to using hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for tolerance induction. These steps include (i) feasibility and efficacy data for tolerance induction in large animal models; (ii) safety data in clinical trials for patients with hematologic malignancies; and (iii) pilot trials of combined HCT and kidney transplantation for tolerance induction. Thus far, only one published trial conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston has achieved long-term acceptance of human leukocyte antigen-mismatched kidney allografts without chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Alternative protocols have been successful in large animals, but long-term organ allograft tolerance has not been reported in patients. Thus, proof-of-principle that nonmyeloablative induction of mixed chimerism can be used intentionally to induce organ allograft tolerance has now been achieved. Directions for further research to make this approach applicable for a broader patient population are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Mixed chimerism and donor-specific tolerance are achieved in mice receiving 3 Gy of total body irradiation and anti-CD154 mAb followed by allogeneic bone marrow (BM) transplantation. In this model, recipient CD4 cells are critically important for CD8 tolerance. To evaluate the role of CD4 cells recognizing donor MHC class II directly, we used class II-deficient donor marrow and were not able to achieve chimerism unless recipient CD8 cells were depleted, indicating that directly alloreactive CD4 cells were necessary for CD8 tolerance. To identify the MHC class II(+) donor cells promoting this tolerance, we used donor BM lacking certain cell populations or used positively selected cell populations. Neither donor CD11c(+) dendritic cells, B cells, T cells, nor donor-derived IL-10 were critical for chimerism induction. Purified donor B cells induced early chimerism and donor-specific cell-mediated lympholysis tolerance in both strain combinations tested. In contrast, positively selected CD11b(+) monocytes/myeloid cells did not induce early chimerism in either strain combination. Donor cell preparations containing B cells were able to induce early deletion of donor-reactive TCR-transgenic 2C CD8 T cells, whereas those devoid of B cells had reduced activity. Thus, induction of stable mixed chimerism depends on the expression of MHC class II on the donor marrow, but no requisite donor cell lineage was identified. Donor BM-derived B cells induced early chimerism, donor-specific cell-mediated lympholysis tolerance, and deletion of donor-reactive CD8 T cells, whereas CD11b(+) cells did not. Thus, BM-derived B cells are potent tolerogenic APCs for alloreactive CD8 cells.",

While promising animal data have been obtained, allogeneic SCs and their progeny are subject to immune-mediated rejection. Here, we review the potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to promote immune tolerance to allogeneic and xenogeneic organs and tissues, to reverse autoimmunity, and to be used optimally to cure hematologic malignancies. We also review the mechanisms by which hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can promote anti-tumor responses and establish donor-specific transplantation tolerance. We discuss the barriers to clinical translation of animal studies and describe some recent studies indicating how they can be overcome. The recent achievements of durable mixed chimerism across human leukocyte antigen barriers without graft-versus-host disease and of organ allograft tolerance through combined kidney and bone marrow transplantation suggest that the potential of this approach for use in the treatment of many human diseases may ultimately be realized.",

        "Abstract": "Although interaction between programmed death-1 (PD-1) and the ligand PD-L1 has been shown to mediate CD8 cell exhaustion in the setting of chronic infection or the absence of CD4 help, a role for this pathway in attenuating early alloreactive CD8 cell responses has not been identified. We demonstrate that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is needed to rapidly tolerize alloreactive CD8 cells in a model that requires CD4 cells and culminates in CD8 cell deletion. This protocol involves allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) following conditioning with low-dose total body irradiation and anti-CD154 antibody. Tolerized donor-reactive T-cell receptor transgenic CD8 cells are shown to be in an abortive activation state prior to their deletion, showing early and prolonged expression of activation markers (compared with rejecting CD8 cells) while being functionally silenced by day 4 after transplantation. Although both tolerized and rejecting alloreactive CD8 cells up-regulate PD-1, CD8 cell tolerance is dependent on the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. In contrast, CD4 cells are tolerized independently of this pathway following BMT with anti-CD154. These studies demonstrate a dichotomy between the requirements for CD4 and CD8 tolerance and identify a role for PD-1 in the rapid tolerization of an alloreactive T-cell population via a deletional mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "Allogeneic bone marrow chimerism induces robust systemic tolerance to donor alloantigens. Achievement of chimerism requires avoidance of marrow rejection by pre-existing CD4 and CD8 T cells, either of which can reject fully MHC-mismatched marrow. Both barriers are overcome with a minimal regimen involving anti-CD154 and low dose (3 Gy) total body irradiation, allowing achievement of mixed chimerism and tolerance in mice. CD4 cells are required to prevent marrow rejection by CD8 cells via a novel pathway, wherein recipient CD4 cells interacting with recipient class II MHC tolerize directly alloreactive CD8 cells. We demonstrate a critical role for recipient MHC class II, B cells, and dendritic cells in a pathway culminating in deletional tolerance of peripheral alloreactive CD8 cells.",

        "Abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a frequent and severe complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). One approach to reducing alloreactivity is to deplete the graft of alloreactive T cells. Global T cell depletion results in poor immune reconstitution with high mortality from viral infections and disease relapse. Therefore, an approach to selectively deplete alloreactive T cells without compromising other responses would be highly beneficial. We undertook studies to identify an inducible activation marker expressed on alloreactive effector T cells following culture with HLA-mismatched allostimulators. Compared to other markers, CD134 was superior because of its negative baseline expression and rapid upregulation after activation. Depletion of CD134(+) cells from responder populations dramatically reduced specific alloreactivity as determined by reduction of helper T cell precursor frequencies below the threshold predicting development of clinical GVHD while retaining responses to third-party alloantigens. CD134-allodepleted populations retained effectors specific for the Wilms' tumor (WT1) leukemia antigen as determined by WT1 specific pentamers, and CMV-specific effectors as determined by CMV-specific pentamers and CMV-specific ELISpot. Thus, use of CD134-allodepleted grafts may improve allogeneic SCT by reducing GVHD without loss of pathogen-specific and leukemia-specific immunity.",

        "Abstract": "Humanized mice with a functional human immune system would be very useful for in vivo studies of human immunobiology. We have previously shown that cotransplantation of human fetal thymus/liver tissues and CD34(+) fetal liver cells into immunodeficient nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice leads to the development of multiple lineages of human lymphohematopoietic cells and formation of secondary lymphoid organs with normal architecture. Here, we evaluated the ability of these humanized mice to develop antigen-specific, T cell-dependent antibody responses after in vivo immunization with T-dependent antigen, 2,4-dinitrophenyl hapten-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DNP(23)-KLH). Human T cells from DNP(23)-KLH-immunized mice showed strong proliferation in response to KLH in vitro. Furthermore, T cell-dependent production of DNP-specific human antibodies (mainly IgG1 and IgG2) was detected in all immunized mice. These results confirm that a functional human immune system can be established in immunodeficient mice through cotransplantation of human fetal thymus/liver tissues and CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.",

        "Abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection depletes thymocytes and destroys thymic structure. Functional, tolerant human T cells develop in vivo in immunodeficient mice receiving porcine thymus and human fetal liver fragments under the kidney capsule. In this model, we evaluated the potential of porcine thymus to protect human thymocytes from the effects of HIV-1. Compared with that observed in control mice with human thymic grafts, porcine thymus attenuated human thymocyte depletion by the CCR5-tropic isolate JR-CSF without preventing thymocyte infection. Porcine thymus protected human thymocytes from infection and depletion by a CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolate without reducing peripheral blood viral loads or T cell infection. Human thymocytes from human but not porcine grafts showed decreased Bcl-2 expression and increased apoptosis after NL4.3 infection. Thus, porcine thymus protects human thymocytes from the cytopathic effect of HIV-1, suggesting a possible approach to achieving immune restoration in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who have incomplete responses to antiretroviral therapy. The model allows analysis of the mechanisms of HIV-mediated thymic dysfunction.",

Although the development of relatively non-toxic immunosuppressive or tolerance-inducing regimens will be required to justify clinical trials using pig organs, recent advances in our understanding of the biology of xenograft rejection and zoonotic infections, and the generation of alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase-deficient pigs have moved this approach closer to clinical application.

In this article, the minimal requirements for achieving mixed chimerism, the development of new reagents that promote its achievement, and the mechanisms by which peripheral and intrathymic tolerance are achieved via mixed chimerism are discussed. An emerging understanding of these mechanisms, along with the development of new immunosuppressive reagents, is allowing advancement toward clinical application of this approach.",

        "Abstract": "We have previously proven that human macrophages can phagocytose porcine cells even in the absence of Ab or complement opsonization, indicating that macrophages present a pivotal immunological obstacle to xenotransplantation. A recent report indicates that the signal regulatory protein (SIRP)alpha is a critical immune inhibitory receptor on macrophages, and its interaction with CD47, a ligand for SIRPalpha, prevents autologous phagocytosis. Considering the limited compatibility (73%) in amino acid sequences between pig and human CD47, we hypothesized that the interspecies incompatibility of CD47 may contribute to the rejection of xenogeneic cells by macrophages. In the present study, we have demonstrated that porcine CD47 does not induce SIRPalpha tyrosine phosphorylation in human macrophage-like cell line, and soluble human CD47-Fc fusion protein inhibits the phagocytic activity of human macrophages toward porcine cells. In addition, we have verified that manipulation of porcine cells for expression of human CD47 radically reduces the susceptibility of the cells to phagocytosis by human macrophages. These results indicate that the interspecies incompatibility of CD47 significantly contributes to the rejection of xenogeneic cells by macrophages. Genetic induction of human CD47 on porcine cells could provide inhibitory signaling to SIRPalpha on human macrophages, providing a novel approach to preventing macrophage-mediated xenograft rejection.",

        "Abstract": "Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) under costimulation blockade induces mixed chimerism and tolerance in rodent models. Recent data, predominantly from in vitro studies, suggest that in addition to blocking the CD28 costimulation pathway CTLA4Ig also acts through upregulating the tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Here we demonstrate that even though CTLA4Ig is critically required for the induction of chimerism and tolerance in a murine model of nonmyeloablative BMT, IDO activity is not. No significant differences were detectable in the kynurenine to tryptophan ratios (indicative of IDO activity) in sera of BMT recipients treated with CTLA4Ig (tolerant group) versus BMT recipients treated without CTLA4Ig (nontolerant group) versus na\u00efve controls. In vivo inhibition of IDO immediately after BMT with CTLA4Ig or several months thereafter did not block achievement of chimerism and tolerance. Thus, IDO does not play a critical role in the induction or maintenance of chimerism and tolerance in a CTLA4Ig-based BMT model.",

        "Abstract": "After allogeneic blood or bone marrow transplantation, donor T cells interact with a distorted antigen-presenting cell (APC) environment in which some, but not all, host APCs are replaced by APCs from the donor. Significantly, host APCs are required for the priming of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Donor APCs play a lesser role in the induction of acute GVHD despite their predicted capacity to cross-present host antigens. In contrast, donor APCs may play a role in perpetuating the tissue injury observed in chronic GVHD. Host APCs are also required for maximal graft-versus-leukemia responses. Recent studies have suggested potential strategies by which the continued presence of host APCs can be exploited to prime strong donor immunity to tumors without the induction of GVHD.",

        "Abstract": "We previously found that CD8 T cells from IFN-gamma gene knockout (GKO) donors induce more severe lethal GVHD compared with CD8 T cells from wild-type (WT) donors in fully MHC-mismatched strain combinations. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which IFN-gamma inhibits GVHD in a parent --> F1 (B6 --> B6D2F1) allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) model. IFN-gamma was strongly protective against GVHD in this parent --> F1 haplotype-mismatched allo-HCT model. Irradiated B6D2F1 mice that received GKO B6 CD4-depleted splenocytes developed lethal GVHD with severe lung and liver injury, whereas those receiving a similar cell population from WT B6 donors survived long term. Donor CD8 cells showed rapid activation, accelerated cell division, and reduced/delayed activation-induced cell death in allogeneic recipients in which donor cells were incapable of producing IFN-gamma. In consequence, the numbers of activated/effector (ie, CD25+, CD62L-, and CD44(high)) donor CD8 T cells in the recipients of GKO allo-HCT significantly exceeded those in mice receiving WT allo-HCT. These data show that IFN-gamma negatively regulates the CD8 T cell response by inhibiting cell division and promoting cell death and suggest that blockade of IFN-gamma could augment the severity of GVHD in patients undergoing allo-HCT.",

        "Abstract": "B-1b cells produce IgM natural antibodies against alpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc (alphaGal). These can be tolerized by nonmyeloablative induction of mixed chimerism using alphaGal-positive (alphaGal+) donor marrow. We assessed the role of CR1/2 in this model for induction of tolerance of B-1b cells. Mixed hematopoietic chimerism was induced in alpha1-3galactosyltransferase (GalT-/-) and GalT-/-Cr2-/- mice with alphaGal+ BALB/c marrow donors. Anti-alphaGal Ab and anti-alphaGal Ab-producing B cells became undetectable in GalT-/- chimeras, whereas they persisted in chimeric GalT-/-Cr2-/- mice. To determine whether CR1/2 expression on stromal cells and/or hematopoietic cells was critical for B-1-cell tolerance, we generated GalT-/- radiation chimeras in which CR1/CR2 was expressed on either stromal cells, hematopoietic cells, neither, or both. After induction of mixed chimerism from alphaGal+ allogeneic bone marrow (BM) donors, anti-alphaGal-producing B cells were rendered tolerant in reconstituted recipients expressing only stromal CR1/CR2. Our results suggest a possible role for follicular dendritic cells that pick up immune complexes via CR1/CR2 receptors in the tolerization of B-1b cells.",

        "Abstract": "Signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha) is a critical immune inhibitory receptor on macrophages, and its interaction with CD47, a ligand for SIRPalpha, prevents autologous phagocytosis. We hypothesized that interspecies incompatibility of CD47 may contribute to the rejection of xenogeneic cells by macrophages. Here, we show that pig CD47 does not interact with mouse SIPRalpha. Similar to CD47-/- mouse cells, porcine red blood cells (RBCs) failed to induce SIRPalpha tyrosine phosphorylation in mouse macrophages. Blocking SIRPalpha with antimouse SIRPalpha mAb (P84) significantly enhanced the phagocytosis of CD47+/+ mouse cells, but did not affect the engulfment of porcine or CD47-/- mouse cells by mouse macrophages. CD47-deficient mice, whose macrophages do not phagocytose CD47-/- mouse cells, showed markedly delayed clearance of porcine RBCs compared with wild-type mouse recipients. Furthermore, mouse CD47 expression on porcine cells markedly reduced their phagocytosis by mouse macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that interspecies incompatibility of CD47 contributes significantly to phagocytosis of xenogeneic cells by macrophages and suggest that genetic manipulation of donor CD47 to improve its interaction with the recipient SIRPalpha may provide a novel approach to prevent phagocyte-mediated xenograft rejection.",

        "Abstract": "Transfer of T cells to freshly irradiated allogeneic recipients leads to their rapid recruitment to nonlymphoid tissues, where they induce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In contrast, when donor T cells are transferred to established mixed chimeras (MCs), GVHD is not induced despite a robust graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction that eliminates normal and malignant host hematopoietic cells. We demonstrate here that donor GVH-reactive T cells transferred to MCs or freshly irradiated mice undergo similar expansion and activation, with similar up-regulation of homing molecules required for entry to nonlymphoid tissues. Using dynamic two-photon in vivo microscopy, we show that these activated T cells do not enter GVHD target tissues in established MCs, contrary to the dogma that activated T cells inevitably traffic to nonlymphoid tissues. Instead, we show that the presence of inflammation within a nonlymphoid tissue is a prerequisite for the trafficking of activated T cells to that site. Our studies help to explain the paradox whereby GVH-reactive T cells can mediate graft-versus-leukemia responses without inducing GVHD in established MCs.",

        "Abstract": "Following bone marrow transplantation, delayed donor leukocyte infusions (DLIs) can induce graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). These antitumor responses are maximized by the presence of host hematopoietic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) at the time of DLI. Using a tumor-protection model, we demonstrate here that GVL activity following administration of DLIs to established mixed chimeras is dependent primarily on reactivity to allogeneic MHC antigens rather than minor histocompatibility or tumor-associated antigens. CD8(+) T-cell-dependent GVL responses against an MHC class II-negative tumor following delayed DLI require CD4(+) T-cell help and are reduced significantly when host APCs lack MHC class II expression. CD4(+) T cells primed by host APCs were required for maximal expansion of graft-versus-host reactive CD8(+) T cells but not their synthesis of IFN-gamma. In contrast, the GVL requirement for CD4(+) T-cell help was bypassed almost completely when DLI was administered to freshly irradiated recipients, indicating that the host environment is a major factor influencing the cellular mechanisms of GVL.",

        "Abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the most significant clinical problem that arises after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Because chemokines induced by proinflammatory conditioning treatment may promote T-cell migration into GVHD target tissues, we addressed the influence of conditioning on chemokine expression in GVHD target organs. Our results showed that (1) conditioning leads to rapid and transient chemokine upregulation in GVHD target tissues before the time of GVHD-associated T-cell infiltration; (2) conditioning intensity and mouse strain influence chemokine expression in GVHD target organs; and (3) compared with syngeneic bone marrow transplantation, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation led to marked amplification of chemokine expression in GVHD target organs after myeloablative conditioning. This is also reflected by chemokine protein expression that is measured in the serum and colon. Intestines showed the greatest sensitivity to conditioning intensity, and chemokines affecting T-helper type 1 cells (eg, interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 [CXCL10]) were most strongly expressed there after conditioning and during GVHD. However, severity of GVHD was not significantly different between recipients of CXCR3+/+ or CXCR3-/- splenocytes, indicating that this chemokine pathway does not play a critical role. In summary, our data show that conditioning and recipient strain influence chemokine expression in GVHD target organs and that GVH alloreactivity markedly amplifies this expression, thus contributing to the inflammatory cascade associated with tissue GVHD.",

        "Abstract": "In mixed chimeras prepared with nonmyeloablative conditioning, we previously showed that recipient leukocyte infusions (RLI) induced loss of donor chimerism and anti-tumor responses against the A20 BALB/c B cell lymphoma. We also previously showed that RLI-mediated tumor rejection involved IFN-gamma-producing RLI-derived CD8+ cells and non-RLI, recipient-derived CD4 T cells, leading to the generation of anti-tumor cytotoxic cells. However, the mechanisms of such paradoxical anti-tumor responses remained to be clarified. In the present study, we further explored the cellular mechanisms of the anti-tumor effects of RLI in fully MHC-mismatched and haploidentical strain combinations. In both cases, we show that RLI breaks the tolerance of chimeric T cells toward donor antigens, in association with the in vivo expansion of recipient splenic T, B and CD4-CD8- cells and the production of IFN-gamma. RLI leads to the development of two types of tumor-specific responses. The first is mediated by indirect presentation of donor antigens and occurs independently of tumor injection. The second is observed only in recipients of RLI and tumor and may involve responses to self antigens. Anti-tumor cytotoxicity was mediated by CD8+ or CD4-CD8- effector cells. Thus, anti-tumor cytotoxic responses are generated following complex interactions between recipient APCs presenting donor and recipient antigens and host-type CD4+, CD8+ and CD4-CD8- cells.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical translation of the mixed-chimerism approach for inducing transplantation tolerance would be facilitated if mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (mPBSCs) could be used instead of bone marrow cells (BMCs). Because the use of mPBSCs for this purpose has not been investigated in nonmyeloablative murine protocols, we explored the engraftment potential of mPBSCs in a CD45-congenic model as a first step. After 2, 1.5, or 1 Gy of total body irradiation, CD45.1 B6 hosts received unseparated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized CD45.2 B6 PBSCs or unseparated CD45.2 B6 BMCs. The same total cell numbers, or aliquots of mPBSCs and BMCs containing similar numbers of c-kit+ cells, were transplanted both with and without a short course of rapamycin-based immunosuppression (IS). Transplantation of mPBSCs induced long-term multilineage macrochimerism, but chimerism levels were significantly lower than among recipients of the same number of BMCs. Transplanting aliquots containing similar numbers of c-kit+ cells reduced the difference between mPBSCs and BMCs, but lower levels of chimerism were nonetheless observed in mPBSC recipients. Chimerism levels correlated more closely with the number of transplanted progenitor cells as determined by colony-forming unit assays. IS did not affect chimerism levels, indicating that the donor CD45 isoform or other minor disparities do not pose a major barrier to engraftment. Our findings indicate that under nonmyeloablative conditions, progenitor cells contained in mPBSCs have an engraftment capacity similar to progenitor cells from BMCs, allowing induction of lasting mixed chimerism with moderate cell numbers. On a cell-per-cell basis, unseparated BMCs have some advantages that may be minimized if the number of progenitor cells is equalized. These results are expected to facilitate the development of mPBSC-based allogeneic tolerance protocols.",

PSGL-1 is rendered functional by terminal glycosylation steps, which occur mainly in activated Th1 but not Th2 cells. alpha(1,3)Fucosyltransferases IV and VII control this glycosylation pathway. Mice lacking these transferases (Fuc-TIV(-/-)/Fuc-TVII(-/-)) lack functional E- and P-selectin ligands. We hypothesized that Fuc-TIV(-/-)/Fuc-TVII(-/-) donor T cells might have reduced capacity to roll on vessels of inflamed target tissues and mediate graft-vs-host disease (GVHD).",

        "Abstract": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) acts in synergy with other inflammatory stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to induce the maturation of migratory-type monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). However, PGE2 has been reported to inhibit IL-12p70 production by MoDCs and to promote the generation of Th2 T cell responses. We demonstrate here that the addition of PGE2 to TNF for the maturation of MoDCs enhanced CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferative responses to neoantigen and recall antigen, and enhanced Th1-type responses. The increased stimulatory capacity of MoDCs matured with PGE2 was associated with a fully mature, migratory-type MoDC phenotype and more rapid down-regulation of the expression of inflammatory chemokines, with up-regulated expression of the constitutive chemokines TARC and MDC. In addition, although MoDCs matured with TNF and PGE2 selectively produced the inhibitory IL-12p40 subunit at steady state, they were able to produce the bioactive IL-12p70 heterodimer after stimulation with CD40 ligand and/or IFN-gamma. Despite increased IL-6 mRNA expression, MoDCs matured with PGE2 did not overcome the suppressive effects of CD4+ CD25+ T cells in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions. In conclusion, MoDCs matured in the presence of PGE2 display characteristics of more efficient antigen-presenting cells that might be optimal for use in cancer vaccine-based clinical trials.",

        "Abstract": "While acquisition of regulatory function by CD4+CD25- T cells has been reported following antigenic stimulation, \"naturally occurring\" regulatory CD4+ T cells (Treg) are believed to express CD25. We examined the mechanisms involved in peripheral CD8 T cell tolerance by induction of mixed chimerism using non-myeloablative conditioning with low-dose (3 Gy) total body irradiation and anti-CD154 antibody. Recipient CD4+ T cells were initially required for the induction of CD8 cell tolerance, but were not needed beyond 2 weeks. Depletion of CD25+ Treg prior to bone marrow transplantation and blockade of IL-2 with neutralizing antibody did not impede tolerance induction. Tolerance was dependent on CTLA4, but not on IFN-gamma. In C57BL/6 mice containing a fraction of 2C TCR transgenic CD8+ T cells, which recognize the MHC class I alloantigen Ld, induction of chimerism with L(d+), but not Ld-, bone marrow cells led to deletion of peripheral 2C+ CD8+ cells within 1 week in peripheral blood and spleen. Complete deletion required the presence of recipient CD4+ T cells. Thus, a novel, rapid form of regulation by CD4+CD25- T cells permits initial CD8 T cell tolerance in this model. Rapid peripheral deletion of donor-specific CD8 T cells precludes an ongoing requirement for CD4 T cell-mediated regulation.",

        "Abstract": "Surprisingly, antitumor responses can occur in patients who reject donor grafts following nonmyeloablative hemopoietic cell transplantation. In murine mixed chimeras prepared with nonmyeloablative conditioning, we previously showed that recipient leukocyte infusions (RLI) induced loss of donor chimerism, IFN-gamma production, and antitumor responses against host-type tumors. However, the mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain to be determined. We now demonstrate that the effects of RLI are mediated by distinct and complex mechanisms. Donor marrow rejection is induced by RLI-derived alloactivated T cells, which activate non-RLI-derived, recipient IFN-gamma-producing cells. RLI-derived CD8 T cells induce the production of IFN-gamma by both RLI and non-RLI-derived recipient cells. The antitumor responses of RLI involve mainly RLI-derived IFN-gamma-producing CD8 T cells and recipient-derived CD4 T cells and do not involve donor T cells. The pathways of donor marrow and tumor rejection lead to the development of tumor-specific cell-mediated cytotoxic responses that are not due to bystander killing by alloreactive T cells.",

        "Abstract": "The induction of mixed chimerism (MC) is a powerful and effective means to achieve transplantation tolerance in rodent models. Host conditioning with irradiation or cytotoxic drugs has been used in many protocols for chimeric induction across allogeneic barriers. The deletion of alloreactive T cell clones has been described as the main mechanism responsible for the induction of a stable MC. In this study, we demonstrate that a stable MC and skin allograft tolerance can be established across MHC barriers by a noncytotoxic, irradiation-free approach using costimulation blockade plus rapamycin treatment. By using an adoptive transfer model of skin allograft and using specific Vbeta TCR probes, we demonstrated that deletion of donor-reactive cytopathic T cell clones is indeed profound in tolerant hosts. Nonetheless, the challenge of tolerant mixed chimeras with 5 million mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) from naive syngeneic mice was neither able to abolish the stable MC nor to trigger skin allograft rejection, a hallmark of peripheral, not central tolerance. Furthermore, in an adoptive transfer model, MNLs harvested from tolerant hosts significantly inhibited the capacity of naive MNLs to reject same donor, but not third-party, skin allografts. Moreover, when we transplanted skin allografts from stable tolerant chimeras onto syngeneic immune-incompetent mice, graft-infiltrating T cells migrated from the graft site, expanded in the new host, and protected allografts from acute rejection by naive syngeneic MNLs. In this model, both deletional and immunoregulatory mechanisms are active during the induction and/or maintenance of allograft tolerance through creation of MC using a potentially clinically applicable regimen.",

        "Abstract": "Since the introduction of organ transplantation into medical practice, progress and optimism have been abundant. Improvements in immunosuppressive drugs and ancillary care have led to outstanding short-term (1--3-year) patient and graft survival rates. This success is mitigated by several problems, including poor long-term (>5-year) graft survival rates, the need for continual immunosuppressive medication and the discrepancy between the demand for organs and the supply. Developing methods to induce transplant tolerance, as a means to improve graft outcomes and eliminate the requirement for immunosuppression, and expanding the pool of organs for transplantation are the major challenges of the field.",

Mixed allogeneic or xenogeneic chimerism indeed tolerizes both preexisting anti-Gal-producing B cells and those developing de novo after establishment of mixed chimerism, even in presensitized mice. We present evidence that different mechanisms are involved in the tolerization of the preexisting and newly-developing antibody-secreting cells.",

        "Abstract": "Based on a murine model, we conducted a series of trials of m-myeloablative human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched or mismatched related donor stem cell transplantation (SCT) with the intention of inducing mixed chimaerism (MC), then administering prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs), for the treatment of advanced haematologic malignancies. Preparative therapy consisted of cyclophosphamide, equine anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or MEDI-507 (an anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody) for in-vivo T-cell depletion, thymic irradiation on day -1 and cyclosporine alone for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. DLIs were given as early as 5 weeks post-SCT in patients with MC without evidence of GVHD. Twenty-two patients ultimately lost their graft (<1% donor cells) that could no be rescued by DLIs. Nine of 22 (41%) patients who lost donor chimaerism achieved an objective response, including three patients who showed evidence of disease regression following DLI, despite continued absence of macrochimaerism. Six patients were alive at 2.5-5.5 years following SCT, including four in continuous complete remission. In summary, it is possible to achieve sustained remission in patients with chemorefractory malignancies following non-myeloablative allogeneic SCT, even in the absence of sustained donor macrochimaerism; DLI may contribute to an ongoing anti-tumour effect in these patients. Immunological mechanisms that correlated with rejection of the graft may have a role in anti-tumour responses via a cell or cytokine-mediated pathway.",

Because of the strong immune response to xenografts, success will probably depend upon new strategies of immune suppression and induction of tolerance.

These GVH responses are confined to the lymphohematopoietic system and mediate graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) reactions without causing GVHD. Although interaction of donor T-cells with host-derived antigen-presenting cells (APC) is central to the development of GVHD, we were able to show that this T-cell/APC interaction is also critical for the induction of GVL, which can occur in the absence of GVHD if donor T-cell administration is delayed to a time point after bone-marrow transplant (BMT) when conditioning-induced inflammation has subsided. Induction of mixed hematopoietic chimerism using the method described below allows analysis of these interactions between host APC and donor T-cells.",

        "Title": "Tolerance induction in clinical transplantation.",
        "Abstract": "Introduction of modern immunosuppressive agents has led to great success of allotransplantation in humans, and survival rates for all solid organs have been dramatically improved. However, a constant proportion of organs is lost every year due to chronic allograft rejection and immunosuppressive drug toxicity. This has led to a situation where, despite the of donor organ shortage, about one third of the patients on the kidney transplant waiting list are listed for a retransplant. The induction of donor-specific tolerance has the potential of at least partially resolving this problem, since it might prevent chronic rejection and drug toxicity at the same time. For a variety of protocols, successful tolerance induction has been demonstrated in rodent models. However, translation of such protocols to large animal models and on clinical trials has turned out to be very difficult. This review briefly describes mechanisms and barriers to transplantation tolerance, and then focuses on pre-clinical and clinical studies in non-human primates and humans. We have divided the strategies into two groups, based on the principle mechanisms of tolerance induction: the first group are protocols not using hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) as part of there regimen. They rely mainly on intensive T cell depletion (either by total body irradiation, total lymphoid irradiation or treatment with T cell-depleting agents such as anti-thymocyte globulin, anti-CD52 antibody or CD3 immunotoxin), which have been combined with costimulatory blockade, signaling blockade or donor antigen infusion. The second group are HCT-based protocols combining HCT with T cell-depleting agents and cytoreductive treatment. So far, only two protocols (one with total lymphoid irradiation and anti-thymocyte globulin, but no HCT; one with HCT, cyclophosphamide, anti-thymocyte globulin and thymic irradiation) have been translated into successful human studies. We summarize and discuss the results of these trials and suggest goals for further studies for the development tolerance protocols applicable for a broad population of allograft recipients.",

        "Abstract": "The establishment of mixed hematopoietic chimerism induces life-long donor-specific organ graft tolerance while obviating the need for chronic immunosuppression. Recent advances have dramatically reduced the conditioning toxicity required to achieve mixed chimerism. We argue that the achievement of high levels of donor chimerism ensures life-long deletion of donor-reactive T cells, precluding and obviating the need for regulatory mechanisms in the maintenance of tolerance. However, in situations where high levels of donor chimerism cannot be established or sustained, control of immune responsiveness can be achieved through additional mechanisms, including regulatory T cells.",

        "Abstract": "Porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) is a potential pathogen in clinical xenotransplantation; transmission of PERV in vivo has been suggested in murine xenotransplantation models. We analyzed the transmission of PERV to human cells in vivo using a model in which immunodeficient NOD/SCID transgenic mice were transplanted with porcine and human lymphohematopoietic tissues. Our results demonstrate, we believe for the first time, that human and pig cells can coexist long-term (up to 25 weeks) without direct PERV infection of human cells. Despite the transplantation of porcine cells that did not produce human-tropic PERV, human cells from the chimeric mice were frequently found to contain PERV sequences. However, this transmission was due to the pseudotyping of PERV-C (a virus without human tropism) by xenotropic murine leukemia virus, rather than to de novo generation of human-tropic PERV. Thus, pseudotyping might account for the PERV transmission previously observed in mice. The absence of direct human cell infection following long-term in vivo coexistence with large numbers of porcine cells provides encouragement regarding the potential safety of using pigs that do not produce human-tropic PERV as source animals for transplantation to humans.",

        "Abstract": "Costimulatory blockade with anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (aCD154) prolongs allograft survival in nonhuman primates, but has not reliably induced tolerance when used alone. In the current studies, we evaluated the effect of adding CD154 blockade to a chimerism inducing nonmyeloablative regimen in primates. We observed a significant improvement of donor bone marrow (DBM) engraftment, which has been associated with a lower incidence of acute rejection and long-term survival of renal allografts without the need for previously required splenectomy. Among the long-term survivors, four never showed evidence of rejection, with the longest survival exceeding 1700 days following discontinuation of immunosuppression. Nevertheless, late chronic rejection was observed in three of eight recipients, indicating the necessity of further modifications of the regimen. Control recipients receiving no DBM or donor splenocytes in place of DBM rejected their allografts. Thus, DBM engraftment with, at least, transient mixed chimerism appears essential for induction of allograft tolerance using this conditioning regimen. Modification of the original mixed chimerism approach, by the addition of costimulatory blockade, has been shown to enhance mixed chimerism and induce renal allograft tolerance with less morbidity in nonhuman primates.",

        "Abstract": "The development of malignant disease might be seen as a failure of immune surveillance. However, not all tumors are naturally immunogenic, and even among those that are immunogenic, the uncontrolled rapid growth of a tumor may sometimes out-run a robust immune response. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that mechanisms of tolerance that normally exist to prevent autoimmune disease may also preclude the development of an adequate antitumor response and that tumors themselves have the ability to thwart the development of effective immune responses against their antigens. A major challenge has been to develop approaches to breaking this tolerance in tumor-bearing hosts, and recent advances in our understanding of antigen presentation and tolerance have led to some promising strategies. An alternative approach is to use T cells from nontumor-bearing, allogeneic hosts in the form of lymphocyte infusions, with or without hematopoietic cell transplantation. Immunotherapy may occur in this setting via the response of nontolerant, tumor antigen-specific T cells from nontumor-bearing hosts or via the powerful destructive effect of an alloresponse directed against antigens shared by malignant cells in the recipient. Approaches to exploiting this beneficial effect without the deleterious consequence of graft-versus-host disease in allogeneic hematopoietic cell recipients are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Anti-CD154 (CD40L) monoclonal antibody (mAb) plus bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in mice receiving CD8 cell-depleting mAb leads to long-term mixed hematopoietic chimerism and systemic donor-specific tolerance through peripheral and central deletional mechanisms. However, CD4(+) T-cell tolerance is demonstrable in vitro and in vivo rapidly following BMT, before deletion of donor-reactive CD4 cells is complete, suggesting the involvement of other mechanisms. We examined these mechanisms in more detail. Spot enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISPOT) analysis revealed specific tolerization (within 4 to 15 days) of both T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokine responses to the donor, with no evidence for cytokine deviation. Tolerant lymphocytes did not significantly down-regulate rejection by naive donor-reactive T cells in adoptive transfer experiments. No evidence for linked suppression was obtained when skin expressing donor alloantigens in association with third-party alloantigens was grafted. T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mixing studies revealed that specific peripheral deletion of alloreactive CD4 T cells occurs over the first 4 weeks following BMT with anti-CD154. In contrast to models involving anti-CD154 without BMT, BMT with anti-CD154 leads to the rapid induction of anergy, followed by deletion of pre-existing donor-reactive peripheral CD4(+) T cells; the rapid deletion of these cells obviates the need for a regulatory cell population to suppress CD4 cell-mediated alloreactivity.",

        "Abstract": "Bone marrow transplantation from diabetes-resistant strains with complete replacement of the recipient immune system by the allogeneic donor has led to tolerance to donor islets and cure of diabetes in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. However, the ability to tolerize host T-cells of diabetic NOD mice is unknown. We demonstrate that nonmyeloablative conditioning achieves mixed hematopoietic chimerism across major histocompatibility complex (MHC) barriers in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice. This conditioning preserves alloreactive and autoreactive diabetogenic host NOD T-cells, but when mixed chimerism was established, diabetic NOD mice accepted donor-type allogeneic islet grafts and were cured of diabetes, despite a significant recipient T-cell contribution. Furthermore, induction of mixed chimerism permitted acceptance of NOD islet grafts, demonstrating reversal of autoimmunity. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was critical for tolerization of diabetogenic and alloreactive host T-cells. Thus, mixed hematopoietic chimerism induces tolerance to donor islets and reverses established autoimmunity in diabetic NOD mice.",

        "Abstract": "Xenotransplantation from pigs could provide a potential solution to the severe shortage of allogeneic donor organs. Because xenogeneic tissues are subject to vigorous immune rejection, tolerance induction is likely to be essential to the success of clinical xenotransplantation. Here we explore the possibility of inducing human T-cell tolerance to porcine xenografts through mixed chimerism. We previously showed that NOD/SCID-Tg mice expressing porcine cytokine transgenes permit the induction of durable porcine hematopoietic chimerism. In this study we achieved human T-cell development in these mice by engrafting human fetal thymus/liver tissues. In porcine hematopoietic chimeras, human thymus grafts were populated with porcine class II(high) cells in addition to human cells, and human T cells were tolerant of the porcine hematopoietic donor as measured by mixed lymphocyte reaction assay and skin grafting. This study proves the principle that porcine chimerism induces tolerance of xenoreactive human T cells.",

        "Abstract": "Treatment with a single injection of anti-CD40L (CD154) monoclonal antibody (mAb) and fully mismatched allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) allows rapid tolerization of CD4+ T cells to the donor. The addition of in vivo CD8 T-cell depletion leads to permanent mixed hematopoietic chimerism and tolerance. We now describe two approaches that obviate the requirement for CD8 T-cell depletion by rapidly tolerizing recipient CD8 T cells in addition to CD4 cells. Administration of donor-specific transfusion (DST) to mice receiving 3 Gy total body irradiation (TBI), BMT and anti-CD40L mAb on day 0 uniformly led to permanent mixed chimerism and tolerance, compared with only 40% of mice receiving similar treatment without DST. In the absence of DST, moving the timing of 3 Gy TBI to day -1 or day -2 instead of day 0 led to rapid (by 2 weeks) induction of CD8+ cell tolerance, and also permitted uniform achievement of permanent mixed chimerism and donor-specific tolerance in recipients of anti-CD40L and BMT on day 0. These nontoxic regimens overcome CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell-mediated alloresistance without requiring host T-cell depletion, permitting the induction of permanent mixed chimerism and tolerance.",

        "Title": "Peritoneal cavity B cells are precursors of splenic IgM natural antibody-producing cells.",
        "Abstract": "Peritoneal cavity B-1 cells are believed to produce IgM natural Abs. We have used alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase-deficient (GalT(-/-)) mice, which, like humans, produce IgM natural Abs against the carbohydrate epitope Galalpha1,3Gal (Gal), to demonstrate that peritoneal cavity B-1b cells with anti-Gal receptors produce anti-Gal IgM Abs only after LPS stimulation. Likewise, peritoneal cavity cells of GalT(-/-) and wild-type mice do not produce IgM Abs of other specificities without LPS stimulation. Development of Ab-secreting capacity is associated with loss of CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) expression. In contrast, there are large numbers of cells producing anti-Gal and other IgM Abs in fresh splenocyte preparations from GalT(-/-) and (for non-Gal specificities) wild-type mice. These cells are Mac-1(-) but otherwise B-1b-like in their phenotype. We therefore hypothesized a pathway wherein peritoneal cavity B cells migrate into the spleen after activation in vivo and lose Mac-1 expression to become IgM Ab-producing cells. Consistent with this possibility, splenectomy reduced anti-Gal Ab production after immunization of GalT(-/-) mice with Gal-positive rabbit RBC. Furthermore, splenectomized B6 GalT(-/-), Ig micro -chain mutant ( micro (-/-)) (both Gal- and B cell-deficient) mice produced less anti-Gal IgM than nonsplenectomized controls after adoptive transfer of peritoneal cavity cells from B6 GalT(-/-) mice. When sorted GalT(-/-) Mac-1(+) peritoneal cavity B cells were adoptively transferred to B6 GalT(-/-), micro (-/-) mice, IgM Abs including anti-Gal appeared, and IgM-producing and Mac1(-) B cells were present in the spleen 5 wk after transfer. These findings demonstrate that peritoneal cavity Mac-1(+) B-1 cells are precursors of Mac-1(-) splenic IgM Ab-secreting cells.",

        "Abstract": "Long-term multilineage chimerism is achieved in CD45 congenic mice receiving high bone marrow doses with or without mediastinal irradiation (MI). Increased donor chimerism results in MI-treated compared with nonirradiated animals, suggesting that MI makes \"space\" for engraftment of donor pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (PHSCs). We have now examined whether space is systemic or whether increased engraftment of donor marrow in locally irradiated mice is confined to the irradiated bones. While increased donor chimerism was observed in irradiated bones compared with nonirradiated bones of MI-treated animals 4 weeks following bone marrow transplantation (BMT), these differences were minimal by 40 weeks. MI-treated chimeras contained more adoptively transferable donor PHSCs in the marrow of both irradiated and distant bones compared with non-MI-treated chimeras. Similar proportions of donor PHSCs were present in irradiated and nonirradiated bones of locally irradiated mice at both 4 and 40 weeks. Irradiated bones contained more donor short-term repopulating cells than distant bones at 4 weeks, but not 40 weeks, after BMT. Our study suggests that local proliferation of donor PHSCs in mice receiving local irradiation rapidly leads to a systemic increase in donor PHSC engraftment.",

        "Abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells kill allogeneic cells that lack a class I MHC ligand for clonally distributed killer inhibitory receptors (KIR). Following HLA-mismatched hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), donor NK cells might mediate graft-vs-host (GVH) reactions that promote donor chimerism and mediate anti-tumor effects. Additionally, recipient NK cells might mediate donor marrow rejection. We have developed a nonmyeloablative approach to haploidentical HCT involving recipient treatment with a T cell-depleting mAb, Medi-507, that can achieve donor engraftment and mixed hematopoietic chimerism without graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are later administered in an effort to achieve graft-vs-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effects without GVHD. It is unknown whether NK cell \"tolerance\" develops in human mixed chimeras.",

        "Abstract": "Murine mixed hematopoietic chimerism can be achieved following nonmyeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide, T cell-depleting monoclonal antibodies, and thymic irradiation. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) 35 days after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) convert mixed to full donor chimerism and mediate graft-versus-lymphoma effects without graft-versus-host disease. We evaluated the role of T-cell subsets in DLIs in converting mixed to full donor chimerism in a fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched strain combination. Whereas DLIs administered on day 35 converted 100% of mixed chimeras to full donor chimerism, conversion was less frequent when either CD4 or CD8 cells were depleted, indicating that both subsets contribute to the conversion. Surprisingly, administration of CD8-depleted DLIs led to complete loss of donor chimerism in a high proportion (54%) of recipients compared with CD4-plus CD8-depleted DLIs (15%) or CD4-depleted DLIs (0%) (P <.05). DLIs administered at early time points after BMT (eg, day 21) also precipitated rejection of donor marrow by recipient alphabeta T cells, in association with donor CD4 cell expansion and high production of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, and interferon-gamma. Thus, DLIs can paradoxically induce marrow rejection by residual host alphabeta T cells. These results have implications for the timing of and use of subset depletion of DLIs in recipients of nonmyeloablative transplants.",

        "Abstract": "Anti-CD40L mAb plus bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and recipient CD8 T-cell depletion permits long-term mixed hematopoietic chimerism and systemic donor-specific tolerance to be achieved across full MHC barriers. Initial tolerance is characterized by peripheral deletion of donor-reactive CD4 cells. In regimens using costimulatory blockade without BMT to achieve allograft survival, cyclosporine inhibited graft survival, suggesting that the combination may not be clinically applicable. We assessed the role of cyclosporine-sensitive mechanisms and the mechanisms of T-cell apoptosis involved in the induction of early peripheral CD4+ T-cell tolerance by BMT with anti-CD40L. Neither a short course of cyclosporine (14 days) nor the absence of FAS-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD) blocked the induction or maintenance of donor-specific tolerance. IL-2 production was not associated with tolerance induction, consistent with the lack of a role for Fas-mediated AICD. Mice in which passive T-cell death was impaired because of constitutive expression of a Bcl-xL transgene did not develop tolerance with this protocol. These data confirm that deletion of donor-reactive T cells is critical for the induction of mixed chimerism and tolerance. However, the mechanisms involved may differ from those involved in costimulatory blockade regimens that do not include BMT.",

        "Abstract": "Infections are a common complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and the leading cause of transplantation-related mortality. It had been hypothesized that transplantation following nonmyeloablative preparative regimens would result in fewer infections by causing less mucosal injury, less graft-versus-host disease, and allowing earlier immune reconstitution. We have retrospectively reviewed the infectious complications of 65 consecutive patients with advanced hematologic malignancies who underwent bone marrow transplantation using a novel preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, thymic irradiation, and in vivo T-cell depletion. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection occurred in 52% of cases in which the donor or recipient had evidence of prior CMV exposure. Using a strategy of preemptive therapy and secondary prophylaxis with ganciclovir, no CMV disease occurred. Infections with gram-positive bacteria predominated over the first 100 days after bone marrow transplantation. Thereafter, the relative proportion of gram-negative infections increased without a significant increase in episodes of neutropenia. The rate of bacterial infections was not influenced by relapse of the underlying malignancy. Seven patients developed infections with Aspergillus species, which was the most common infectious cause of death in these patients. Infections with viruses other than CMV (n=10) and with protozoan organisms (n=2) also occurred. The use of HLA-mismatched donors, the occurrence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease, and treatment with corticosteroids did not influence the risk of CMV or bacterial or fungal infections in patients who underwent transplantation following this preparative regimen. Overall, the incidence and spectrum of infections in this series was similar to the reported incidence of infections following conventional myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We conclude that a quantitative T-cell deficiency in these extensively T-cell depleted patients may be a risk factor for infection, even in the absence of graft-versus-host disease.",

        "Abstract": "Some patients lose chimerism following nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), yet, surprisingly, enjoy sustained tumor remissions. We hypothesized that host-versus-graft (HVG) alloresponses might induce antitumor effects against recipient tumors. We explored this question in mice by administering recipient leukocyte infusions (RLIs) to mixed chimeras established with nonmyeloablative conditioning. Mixed chimeras were prepared in the B10.A (H2a)-->B6 (H2b) strain combination using depleting anti-T-cell monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), cyclophosphamide, and thymic irradiation. B6 myeloid leukemia cells (MMB3.19) were administered 7 days following donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or RLI on day 35. Conversion to full donor chimerism occurred without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following DLI, whereas RLI led to loss of chimerism. Both RLI and DLI significantly delayed tumor mortality. In another strain combination (B10.BR [H2k]-->BALB/c [H2d]), RLI-induced or spontaneous loss of chimerism was associated with antitumor effects against the host-type B-cell lymphoma A20. HCT was essential for the antitumor effect of RLI. RLI induced elevated serum interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels, and recipient-derived IFN-gamma was critical for their antitumor effects. Thus, HVG reactions (spontaneous or induced by RLI) mediate antitumor effects against hematologic malignancies via a recipient-derived IFN-gamma-mediated mechanism. A novel approach to achieving anti-tumor effects without the risk of GVHD is suggested.",

        "Abstract": "We initiated a clinical trial of nonmyeloablative haploidentical stem-cell transplantation (SCT) using MEDI-507, an immunoglobulin-G1 monoclonal anti-CD2 antibody. The trial was based on a preclinical major histocompatibility complex-mismatched bone marrow transplant model in which graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was prevented and mixed chimerism as a platform for adoptive cellular immunotherapy was reliably induced. Twelve patients (three cohorts of four patients each) received cyclophosphamide, MEDI-507, and haploidentical unmanipulated bone marrow (n=8) or ex vivo T-cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cells (n=4) for chemorefractory hematologic malignancy. A two-dose regimen and schedule modifications of MEDI-507 were undertaken because of graft loss in the first cohort of four patients and GVHD in the second cohort. With ex vivo T-cell-depleted peripheral blood SCT, mixed chimerism occurred in all four patients without GVHD. Two patients, however, subsequently lost their grafts. Nonmyeloablative preparative therapy with MEDI-507 and haploidentical SCT have led to the reliable induction of at least transient mixed chimerism as a potential platform for adoptive cellular immunotherapy.",

        "Title": "Impact of prophylactic donor leukocyte infusions on mixed chimerism, graft-versus-host disease, and antitumor response in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies treated with nonmyeloablative conditioning and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.",
        "Abstract": "In an attempt to capture graft-versus-tumor effects without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the authors initiated a trial of nonmyeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, with the majority of patients having chemotherapy-refractory disease. Forty-two patients received an HLA-matched related donor BMT after a cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin-based conditioning that also included thymic irradiation for patients who had not received prior mediastinal radiotherapy. Prophylactic donor leukocyte infusion (pDLI) at a dose of 1 x 10(7) CD3(+) cells per kilogram were given beginning 5 weeks post-BMT to 16 patients with mixed chimerism (MC) but without GVHD, whereas 26 patients did not receive pDLI, either because of GVHD or early relapse. Twelve of 16 patients (75%) receiving pDLI had T cell chimerism at the time of pDLI >/=40%. These patients, by day 100 post-BMT, either converted to full donor chimerism (FDC) (n = 10) or had an increase in or stable donor chimerism (n = 2) after pDLI. Four of 4 patients whose T cell chimerism was </=20% at the time of pDLI, lost the graft. In contrast, only 5 of 18 evaluable patients (28%) not receiving a pDLI converted to FDC by day 100 post-BMT, 7 maintained MC, and 10 of an evaluable 22 lost the graft. Patients who had undergone a previous autologous stem cell transplant had a higher rate of conversion to FDC (69% v 31%) and higher incidence of GVHD (69% v 34%) compared with those who did not have a previous autologous SCT. Eleven of 16 patients (69%) who received a pDLI achieved a remission with 50% 1-year progression-free survival rate and 44% 3-year overall survival rate. Nineteen of 42 patients (45%) had >/=grade II acute GVHD, including 12 after BMT and 7 after pDLI. Approximately one third of patients, after having initial MC, eventually lost their donor graft. The authors conclude that (1) pDLI has the potential to convert MC to FDC; (2) sustained remissions can be achieved in patients with chemorefractory hematologic malignancies who receive a pDLI, albeit with a significant risk of acute GVHD; and (3) the degree of donor T cell chimerism at the time of pDLI is predictive of the fate of MC, ie, donor T cell chimerism >/=40% or </=20% at the time of pDLI correlates with conversion of MC or loss of the graft, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Alterations in inhibitory receptor expression on NK cells have been detected in mixed allogeneic chimeras and in mosaic MHC class I-expressing transgenic mice. However, it is not known whether or not NK cells are tolerant to host and donor Ags in mixed chimeras. In vitro studies have shown a lack of mutual tolerance of separated donor and host NK cells obtained from mixed chimeras. Using BALB/c-->B6 fully MHC-mismatched mixed chimeras, we have now investigated this question in vivo. Neither donor nor host NK cells in mixed chimeras showed evidence for activation, as indicated by expression of B220 and Thy-1.2 on NK cells in chimeric mice at levels similar to those in nonchimeric control mice. Lethally irradiated, established mixed BALB/c--> B6 chimeras rejected a low dose of beta(2)-microglobulin-deficient bone marrow cells (BMC) efficiently but did not reject BALB/c or B6 BMCs. In contrast, similarly conditioned B6 mice rejected both BALB/c and beta(2)-microglobulin-deficient BMCs. Thus, NK cells were specifically tolerant to the donor and the host in mixed allogeneic chimeras. The similar growth of RMA lymphoma cells in both chimeric and control B6 mice further supports the conclusion that donor BALB/c NK cells are tolerant to B6 Ags in chimeras. Administration of a high dose of exogenous IL-2 could not break NK cell tolerance in chimeric mice, suggesting that NK cell tolerance in chimeras is not due to a lack of activating cytokine. No reduction in the level of expression of the activating receptor Ly-49D, recognizing a donor MHC molecule, was detected among recipient NK cells in mixed chimeras. Thus, the present studies demonstrate that NK cells in mixed chimeras are stably tolerant to both donor and host Ags, by mechanisms that are as yet unexplained.",

        "Abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) mediated by donor T cells recognizing host alloantigens is associated with beneficial graft-versus-tumor effects in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants. Since leukemias and lymphomas reside largely within the lymphohematopoietic system, we have proposed that the desired graft-versus-leukemia or graft-versus-lymphoma effect can be separated from the complication of GvHD by confinement of the graft-versus-host alloresponse to the lymphohematopoietic tissues. Since the new sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist immunosuppressive drug FTY720 leads to trapping of T cells in secondary lymphoid tissues, we evaluated the possibility that this drug could diminish GvHD, a disease involving epithelial target tissues, while permitting a beneficial alloresponse to take place within the lymphohematopoietic system, leading to graft-versus-lymphoma effects. We demonstrate here that FTY720 markedly reduces GvHD in a clinically relevant, haploidentical strain combination, while permitting antitumor effects against a T cell lymphoma of unshared host MHC haplotype to proceed unhindered. These results establish a potential new immunotherapeutic approach to separating graft-versus-leukemia effects from GvHD.",

        "Abstract": "A 51-year-old patient with refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) received non-myeloablative conditioning and a two of six (A, B, DR) human leucocyte antigen (HLA) mismatched donor BMT. Post-BMT lymphocytes showed fluctuating T- and natural killer (NK)-cell chimerism, which culminated in mainly donor lymphocytes by Day + 100. Changes in lymphocyte chimerism correlated with anti-donor and anti-host responses in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). On Day + 100, a strong anti-host response was observed in MLR in the absence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), together with near complete regression of the patient's lymphoma. A mild chronic GVHD later developed and, eventually, by 680 days post-BMT, the lymphoma had relapsed and MLR reflected a state of global immune unresponsiveness. These observations demonstrate evolving host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host tolerance that correlates with fluctuating lymphoid chimerism and graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effects, in the absence of severe GVHD. Eventual lymphoma relapse temporally correlated with a generalised immunosuppressed state.",

        "Abstract": "Xenotransplantation of pig organs to humans is a possible solution to the shortage of donor organs for transplantation. Multiple immunologic barriers need to be overcome if pig-to-primate transplantation is to be successful. The presence, in humans, of natural antibodies (Abs) directed against Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc epitopes on pig vascular endothelium provides the major barrier, as antibody-antigen binding initiates the process of hyperacute rejection. Even if hyperacute rejection is prevented, acute vascular rejection develops. Acute vascular rejection is also mediated, in part, by xenoreactive Abs and may be complement-independent. Efforts being made to overcome antibody-mediated rejection include depletion of antibody by extracorporeal immunoadsorption, prevention of an induced Ab response by pharmacologic reagents, B-cell and/or plasma cell depletion, depletion or inhibition of complement, and the use of organs from pigs transgenic for human complement regulatory proteins. The ultimate solution would be the induction of B-cell tolerance to xenogeneic antigens, which is being explored by attempting to induce xenogeneic hematopoietic chimerism. Here, we review the properties of the B cell types responding to xenoantigens and the strategies for tolerizing those B cells.",

        "Abstract": "Xenospecific T-cell tolerance can be induced among murine and human T-cells by porcine thymic grafting. However, anti-alpha 1,3-galactosyltranserase (alphaGal) (Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc-R) natural antibodies (NAbs) pose a major barrier to porcine xenografts in humans. We used alphaGal knockout (KO) and muchain KO mice to explore the effect of natural anti-alphaGal and other xenoantibodies on porcine thymic engraftment and to examine the potential of thymic tissue to tolerize anti-alphaGal antibody-producing cells. Thymectomized [adult thymectomy (ATX)] non-immunized and rabbit red blood cell (RRBC) pre-transplant immunized alphaGal-KO (knockout), wild-type (WT) and mu chain KO B6 mice were treated with 3Gy total body irradiation (TBI), and T and natural killer (NK) cell depleting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). These conditioned mice were grafted with fetal porcine thymus and liver (FP THY/LIV) tissue under the kidney capsule. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to follow CD4 reconstitution as a measure of FP THY engraftment and function. Only mice with >10% CD4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were considered successfully engrafted. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to assess the kinetics of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG anti-alphaGal antibodies. Anti-pig antibodies were monitored by flow cytometry (FCM). FP THY engrafted successfully in most of the immunoglobulin deficient mice (11 out of 12, 92%) and the outcome was similar in WT B6 controls (8 out of 12, 67%). Non-immunized alphaGal-KO mice grafted with FP THY had a similar success rate (7 out of 11) to that observed in non-immunized alphaGal-WT controls (2 out of 4). In contrast, alphaGal-KO mice immunized pre-transplant with RRBC, then grafted with FP THY/LIV, showed a significant reduction in the success of thymic grafting (2 out of 9, 22%) compared with pre-transplant immunized WT controls (4 out of 7; 57%) and non-immunized alphaGal-KO mice (7 out of 11, 64%). Anti-Gal and anti-pig antibody levels were not markedly augmented by porcine thymus grafts in mice with successful thymus grafts. FP THY engraftment is impaired in the presence of high levels of anti-alphaGal xenoantibodies. However, low levels of anti-alphaGal antibodies and other mouse anti-pig NAbs appear not to play a major role in the rejection of FP THY. Although grafting FP THY expressing the alphaGal epitope did not tolerize B cells producing anti-alphaGal antibodies in a T-cell independent manner, it prevented T-cell dependent sensitization by inducing T-cell tolerance to porcine antigens.",

        "Abstract": "CD4 repopulation can be achieved in T cell-depleted, thymectomized mice grafted with xenogeneic porcine thymus tissue. These CD4 T cells are specifically tolerant of the xenogeneic porcine thymus donor and the recipient, but are positively selected only by porcine MHC. Recent studies suggest that optimal peripheral survival of naive CD4 T cells requires the presence of the same class II MHC in the periphery as that of the thymus in which they were selected. These observations would suggest that T cells selected on porcine thymic MHC would die rapidly in the periphery, where porcine MHC is absent. Persistent CD4 reconstitution achieved in mice grafted with fetal porcine thymus might be due to increased thymic output to compensate for rapid death of T cells in the periphery. Comparison of CD4 T cell decay after removal of porcine or murine thymic grafts ruled out this possibility. No measurable role for peripheral murine class II MHC in maintaining the naive CD4 pool originating in thymic grafts was demonstrable. However, mouse class II MHC supported the conversion to, survival, and/or proliferation of memory-type CD4 cells selected in fetal porcine thymus. Thus, the same MHC as that mediating positive selection in the thymus is not critical for maintenance of the memory CD4 cell pool in the periphery. Our results support the interpretation that xenogeneic thymic transplantation is a feasible strategy to reconstitute CD4 T cells and render recipients tolerant of a xenogeneic donor.",

        "Title": "The influence of immunosuppressive drugs on tolerance induction through bone marrow transplantation with costimulation blockade.",
        "Abstract": "We recently developed a murine protocol for the induction of allogeneic mixed chimerism and tolerance employing nonmyeloablative total body irradiation (TBI), standard-dose bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and costimulation blockade (cobl) with an anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb) plus CTLA4Ig. We now evaluated whether a short course (1 month) of immunosuppressive drugs, which would be ethically required in the clinical setting of organ transplantation to prevent graft loss in case tolerance is not achieved, interferes with tolerance induced with this regimen. Our results show that calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporin A [CyA] or tacrolimus [FK]) inhibit development of long-term chimerism and abrogate tolerance induction in this model. Rapamycin (rapa), methylprednisolone (MP), FTY720, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), in contrast, have no negative effect on chimerism or tolerance development. Peripheral deletion of donor-reactive T cells, which usually occurs in the weeks following BMT in this model, is blocked by CyA and FK, but not by the other drugs tested. Furthermore, we found that the additional use of compatible immunosuppressive drugs (rapa plus MMF plus MP) allows the dose of TBI to be reduced, so that mixed chimerism and donor skin-graft acceptance can be achieved with 1 Gy using clinically feasible cell numbers. Thus, this protocol of BMT with costimulation blockade can be safely combined with a clinically tested immunosuppressive regimen to permit success with a lower dose of irradiation. These results should facilitate clinical application of this tolerance strategy.",

        "Abstract": "Side-population (SP) cells are a recently described rare cell population detected in selected tissues of various mammalian species, but not yet described in the peripheral circulation. In the present study, we have identified for the first time SP cells in lineage-negative adult human blood and have provided an extensive functional and immunophenotypic characterization of these cells. Adult peripheral blood was depleted of mature leukocyte cell types by density gradient and immunomagnetic separation. The SP cell population was identified by its characteristic Hoechst 33342 profile. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed that blood SP cells expressed high levels of CD45, CD59, CD43, CD49d, CD31, and integrin markers and lacked CD34. Highly purified SP cells were put into cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC), long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC), and liquid cell culture assays; repopulating assays were performed utilizing nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. Circulating SP cells were shown to exhibit verapamil sensitivity and a low growth rate. LTC-IC, CAFC, and engraftment assays indicated that circulating SP cells had lost the multipotentiality described in murine bone marrow SP cells. However, outgrowth of mature cell types from liquid cell culture suggests the presence of common lymphoid (T and natural killer) and dendritic cell precursor(s) within circulating SP cell populations. The absence of SP cell growth in the LTC-IC, CAFC, and repopulating assays might be intrinsic to the tissue source (marrow versus blood) or species (mouse versus human) tested. Thus, human blood SP cells, although rare, may serve as a source of selected leukocyte progenitor cells. The immunophenotype of circulating SP cells may provide clues to their seeding and homing capacity.",

        "Abstract": "In mice, donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) given to established mixed allogeneic chimeras can mediate powerful graft-versus-host (GVH) reactions confined to the lymphohematopoietic system without inducing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In a clinical trial attempting to capture this approach to achieve graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effects without GVHD, we have observed surprisingly powerful antitumor effects of DLI in patients achieving mixed chimerism after nonmyeloablative bone marrow transplantation. This observation led us to hypothesize that host antigen-presenting cells in mixed chimeras might be required to optimally present recipient antigens to the donor lymphocytes, leading to maximal graft-versus-tumor effects. To test this hypothesis, we established mixed and fully allogeneic hematopoietic chimeras in B6 mice and evaluated the effect of DLI on EL4 T-cell lymphoma. DLI administration to mixed chimeras produced dramatically improved leukemia-free survival compared to administration of DLI to full donor chimeras. DLI also converted mixed chimeras to full chimeras without causing GVHD. The magnitude of the GVL effect was dependent on the level of major histocompatibility complex class I expression on recipient hematopoietic cells in mixed chimeras. Thus, the induction of mixed chimerism followed by delayed DLI provides an approach to inhibiting GVHD that optimizes GVL effects.",

        "Abstract": "To combat the shortage of donor organs, transplantation across species barriers has been proposed. Induction of tolerance would overcome the substantial immunologic barriers to xenotransplantation and would avoid the chronic use of immunosuppressive agents. Successful transplantation of hematopoietic cells induces robust specific tolerance to donor antigens in allogeneic and xenogeneic models. The beta1 integrin class of adhesion molecules and their interactions with extracellular matrix components are thought to be integral to the engraftment and maturation of hematopoietic stem cells. We therefore examined the efficacy of porcine very late antigen-5 (VLA-5) and VLA-4 interactions with the human extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, fibronectin. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from humans and miniature swine were flourochrome labeled and adhesion to plates coated with whole human fibronectin (whFN) or its 120 KDa fragment containing the VLA-5 binding region was determined. Flow cytometry and immuno- precipitation were used to identify a monoclonal antibody that cross-reacted on porcine VLA-5. Human and pig PBMC adhesion to human fibronectin (hFN) or 120 kDa fragment-coated plates was assessed following incubation with control ab, anti-VLA-4, anti-VLA-5, or soluble fibronectin. Using rabbit complement, cells expressing VLA-5 were purged from PBMC preparations before performing the adhesion assay. Porcine and human PBMC both adhered to hFN in a divalent cation-dependent and activation-dependent manner. Adhesion to hFN of human but not pig PBMC was blocked by anti-VLA-5 monoclonal antibody SAM-1, although this mAb immunoprecipitated a heterodimeric cell surface molecule (155/135 kDa) resembling VLA-5 from pig PBMC. Complement-mediated depletion of VLA-5-expressing cells ablated specific binding of human but not porcine cells to hFN and its 120 kDa fragment. Addition of soluble fibronectin was capable of blocking adhesion of PBMC of both species to hFN. Anti-VLA-4 reduced the binding of PBMC from both species to hFN to a similar extent. Human and pig cells can specifically adhere to hFN and its 120 kDa fragment, suggesting that this critical cell-ECM interaction is preserved across species. While human cells exclusively use VLA-5 for binding to the 120 kDa fragment, porcine cells could not be shown to adhere to whFN or its 120 kDa fragment via VLA-5. However, porcine VLA-4 is capable of mediating adhesion to human FN. We conclude that disparities in the adhesive interactions of beta1 integrins may be a barrier to the use of porcine hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as a means of inducing donor-specific tolerance in the pig to human species combination.",

        "Abstract": "In a recently developed murine model for the induction of mixed chimerism and tolerance, hosts are treated with T cell depleting monoclonal antibodies (TCD mAbs; days -5, -1 and +7), thymic irradiation (TI) (7 Gy), and a high dose of fully allogeneic bone marrow cells (BMC, 200 x 10(6)). To find the minimum amount of each treatment required for success with this approach, we treated groups with (1) a lower dose of TI (3.5 Gy), (2) fewer BMC (100 x 10(6)), (3) no TI, (4) no TI plus additional TCD mAbs on day +14, or (5) fewer injections of TCD mAbs (day -5 only). Chimerism was followed by flow cytometry (FCM), and tolerance was assessed by skin grafting. Without TI, no long-term chimerism or tolerance could be induced, even when an additional dose of TCD mAbs was administered on day +14. A reduction in the dose of either BMC or TI led to substantially reduced effectiveness, as demonstrated by lower levels of chimerism and poorer donor skin graft survival. However, the dose of TCD mAbs and hence the duration of recipient T cell depletion could be safely reduced and thus the potential toxicity of the conditioning regimen lowered.",

        "Abstract": "The graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-inducing activity of CD8 T cells was compared in murine recipients of wild-type (WT) or interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-deficient (GKO) allogeneic donor cells. CD8 T cells (or CD4-depleted splenocytes) from GKO donor mice induced more severe GVHD in lethally irradiated allogeneic recipients compared to the same cell populations from WT donors. Consistent with GVHD severity, donor CD8 T-cell expansion in allogeneic recipients was augmented in the absence of IFN-gamma. These results demonstrate that IFN-gamma does not stimulate but instead down-modulates GVHD induced by donor CD8 T cells. Remarkably, antihost lymphohematopoietic reactions, including GVL effects against host leukemia/lymphoma cells, of CD8 T cells correlated inversely with their GVHD-inducing activity, and those of GKO donors were markedly weaker than those mediated by WT donor CD8 T cells. These data show for the first time that GVHD-inducing activity and GVL effects of allogeneic CD8 T cells can be separated by a single cytokine, IFN-gamma. (Blood. 2002;99:4207-4215)",

        "Abstract": "Induction of tolerance is likely to be essential for successful xenotransplantation because immune responses across xenogeneic barriers are vigorous. Although mixed hematopoietic chimerism leads to stable donor-specific tolerance in allogeneic and closely related xenogeneic (eg, rat-to-mouse) combinations, the ability of this approach to induce tolerance across a highly disparate xenogeneic barrier has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, we investigated the immune responses of murine T cells that developed in mice with pre-established porcine hematopoietic chimerism. Our results show for the first time that induction of porcine hematopoietic chimerism can eliminate the development of antiporcine donor responses in a highly disparate xenogeneic species. Porcine hematopoietic chimeras showed donor-specific nonresponsiveness in the mixed lymphocyte reaction, lack of antidonor IgG antibody production, and acceptance of donor skin grafts. Thus, mixed chimerism is capable of inducing tolerance in a highly disparate xenogeneic combination and may have clinical potential to prevent xenograft rejection. (Blood. 2002;99:3823-3829)",

        "Title": "Elimination of porcine hemopoietic cells by macrophages in mice.",
        "Abstract": "The difficulty in achieving donor hemopoietic engraftment across highly disparate xenogeneic species barriers poses a major obstacle to exploring xenograft tolerance induction by mixed chimerism. In this study, we observed that macrophages mediate strong rejection of porcine hemopoietic cells in mice. Depletion of macrophages with medronate-encapsulated liposomes (M-liposomes) markedly improved porcine chimerism, and early chimerism in particular, in sublethally irradiated immunodeficient and lethally irradiated immunocompetent mice. Although porcine chimerism in the peripheral blood and spleen of M-liposome-treated mice rapidly declined after macrophages had recovered and became indistinguishable from controls by wk 5 post-transplant, the levels of chimerism in the marrow of these mice remained higher than those in control recipients at 8 wks after transplant. These results suggest that macrophages that developed in the presence of porcine chimerism were not adapted to the porcine donor and that marrow-resident macrophages did not phagocytose porcine cells. Moreover, M-liposome treatment had no effect on the survival of porcine PBMC injected into the recipient peritoneal cavity, but was essential for the migration and relocation of these cells into other tissues/organs, such as spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. Together, our results suggest that murine reticuloendothelial macrophages, but not those in the bone marrow and peritoneal cavity, play a significant role in the clearance of porcine hemopoietic cells in vivo. Because injection of M-liposomes i.v. mainly depletes splenic macrophages and liver Kupffer cells, the spleen and/or liver are likely the primary sites of porcine cell clearance in vivo.",
