        "Abstract": "Targeted recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligases to degrade traditionally undruggable proteins is a disruptive paradigm for developing new therapeutics. Two salient limitations are that <2% of the ~600 E3 ligases in the human genome have been exploited to produce proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), and the efficacy of the approach has not been demonstrated for a vital class of complex multi-subunit membrane proteins- ion channels. NEDD4-1 and NEDD4-2 are physiological regulators of myriad ion channels, and belong to the 28-member HECT (homologous to E6AP C-terminus) family of E3 ligases with widespread roles in cell/developmental biology and diverse diseases including various cancers, immunological and neurological disorders, and chronic pain. The potential efficacy of HECT E3 ligases for targeted protein degradation is unexplored, constrained by a lack of appropriate binders, and uncertain due to their complex regulation by layered intra-molecular and posttranslational mechanisms. Here, we identified a nanobody that binds with high affinity and specificity to a unique site on the N-lobe of the NEDD4-2 HECT domain at a location physically separate from sites critical for catalysis- the E2 binding site, the catalytic cysteine, and the ubiquitin exosite- as revealed by a 3.1 \u00c5 cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction.

        "Abstract": "The ability to fight or flee from a threat relies on an acute adrenergic surge that augments cardiac output, which is dependent on increased cardiac contractility and heart rate. This cardiac response depends on \u03b2-adrenergic-initiated reversal of the small RGK G protein Rad-mediated inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV) acting through the Cav\u03b2 subunit. Here, we investigate how Rad couples phosphorylation to augmented Ca2+ influx and increased cardiac contraction. We show that reversal required phosphorylation of Ser272 and Ser300 within Rad's polybasic, hydrophobic C-terminal domain (CTD). Phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 in Rad's N-terminal domain (NTD) alone was ineffective. Phosphorylation of Ser272 and Ser300 or the addition of 4 Asp residues to the CTD reduced Rad's association with the negatively charged, cytoplasmic plasmalemmal surface and with CaV\u03b2, even in the absence of CaV\u03b1, measured here by FRET. Addition of a posttranslationally prenylated CAAX motif to Rad's C-terminus, which constitutively tethers Rad to the membrane, prevented the physiological and biochemical effects of both phosphorylation and Asp substitution. Thus, dissociation of Rad from the sarcolemma, and consequently from CaV\u03b2, is sufficient for sympathetic upregulation of Ca2+ currents.",

In the heart, loss-of-function mutations in the hERG potassium channel account for approximately 30% of long-QT syndrome arrhythmia, a lethal cardiac disorder with limited treatment options. Premature termination of ribosomal translation produces a truncated and, for potassium channels, a potentially dominant-negative protein that impairs the functional assembly of the wild-type homotetrameric hERG channel complex. We used high-throughput flow cytometry and patch-clamp electrophysiology to assess the trafficking and voltage-dependent activity of hERG channels carrying patient PTC variants that have been corrected by anticodon engineered tRNA. Adenoviral-mediated expression of mutant hERG channels in cultured adult guinea pig cardiomyocytes prolonged action potential durations, and this deleterious effect was corrected upon adenoviral delivery of a human Arg",

        "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The clinical phenotypes are variable, ranging from spontaneous recovery to serious illness and death. On March 2020, a global COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of February 2023, almost 670 million cases and 6,8 million deaths have been confirmed worldwide. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, contain a single-stranded RNA genome enclosed in a viral capsid consisting of four structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, in the ribonucleoprotein core, the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, and the membrane (M) protein, embedded in the surface envelope. In particular, the E protein is a poorly characterized viroporin with high identity amongst all the \u03b2-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43) and a low mutation rate. Here, we focused our attention on the study of SARS-CoV-2 E and M proteins, and we found a general perturbation of the host cell calcium (Ca",

        "Abstract": "Fight-or-flight responses involve \u03b2-adrenergic-induced increases in heart rate and contractile force. In the present study, we uncover the primary mechanism underlying the heart's innate contractile reserve. We show that four protein kinase A (PKA)-phosphorylated residues in Rad, a calcium channel inhibitor, are crucial for controlling basal calcium current and essential for \u03b2-adrenergic augmentation of calcium influx in cardiomyocytes. Even with intact PKA signaling to other proteins modulating calcium handling, preventing adrenergic activation of calcium channels in Rad-phosphosite-mutant mice (4SA-Rad) has profound physiological effects: reduced heart rate with increased pauses, reduced basal contractility, near-complete attenuation of \u03b2-adrenergic contractile response and diminished exercise capacity. Conversely, expression of mutant calcium-channel \u03b2-subunits that cannot bind 4SA-Rad is sufficient to enhance basal calcium influx and contractility to adrenergically augmented levels of wild-type mice, rescuing the failing heart phenotype of 4SA-Rad mice. Hence, disruption of interactions between Rad and calcium channels constitutes the foundation toward next-generation therapeutics specifically enhancing cardiac contractility.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in HNF1A cause Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (HNF1A-MODY). To understand mechanisms of \u03b2-cell dysfunction, we generated stem cell-derived pancreatic endocrine cells with hypomorphic mutations in HNF1A. HNF1A-deficient \u03b2-cells display impaired basal and glucose stimulated-insulin secretion, reduced intracellular calcium levels in association with a reduction in CACNA1A expression, and accumulation of abnormal\u00a0insulin granules in association with SYT13 down-regulation. Knockout of CACNA1A and SYT13 reproduce the relevant phenotypes. In HNF1A deficient \u03b2-cells, glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea drug used in the treatment of HNF1A-MODY patients, increases intracellular calcium, and restores insulin secretion. While insulin secretion defects are constitutive in \u03b2-cells null for HNF1A, \u03b2-cells heterozygous for hypomorphic HNF1A (R200Q) mutations lose the ability to secrete insulin gradually; this phenotype is prevented by correction of the mutation. Our studies illuminate the molecular basis for the efficacy of treatment of HNF1A-MODY with sulfonylureas, and suggest promise for the use of cell therapies.",

        "Title": "Targeted ubiquitination of sensory neuron calcium channels reduces the development of neuropathic pain.",
        "Abstract": "Neuropathic pain caused by lesions to somatosensory neurons due to injury or disease is a widespread public health problem that is inadequately managed by small-molecule therapeutics due to incomplete pain relief and devastating side effects. Genetically encoded molecules capable of interrupting nociception have the potential to confer long-lasting analgesia with minimal off-target effects. Here, we utilize a targeted ubiquitination approach to achieve a unique posttranslational functional knockdown of high-voltage-activated calcium channels (HVACCs) that are obligatory for neurotransmission in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. CaV-a\u03b2lator comprises a nanobody targeted to CaV channel cytosolic auxiliary \u03b2 subunits fused to the catalytic HECT domain of the Nedd4-2 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Subcutaneous injection of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 encoding CaV-a\u03b2lator in the hind paw of mice resulted in the expression of the protein in a subset of DRG neurons that displayed a concomitant ablation of CaV currents and also led to an increase in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Mice subjected to spare nerve injury displayed a characteristic long-lasting mechanical, thermal, and cold hyperalgesia underlain by a dramatic increase in coordinated phasic firing of DRG neurons as reported by in vivo Ca2+ spike recordings. CaV-a\u03b2lator significantly dampened the integrated Ca2+ spike activity and the hyperalgesia in response to nerve injury. The results advance the principle of targeting HVACCs as a gene therapy for neuropathic pain and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of posttranslational functional knockdown of ion channels achieved by exploiting the ubiquitin-proteasome system.",

        "Abstract": "Selective ion channel modulators play a critical role in physiology in defining the contribution of specific ion channels to physiological function and as proof of concept for novel therapeutic strategies. Antibodies are valuable research tools that have broad uses including defining the expression and localization of ion channels in native tissue, and capturing ion channel proteins for subsequent analyses. In this review, we detail how renewable and recombinant antibodies can be used to control ion channel function. We describe the different forms of renewable and recombinant antibodies that have been used and the mechanisms by which they modulate ion channel function. We highlight the use of recombinant antibodies that are expressed intracellularly (intrabodies) as genetically encoded tools to control ion channel function. We also offer perspectives of avenues of future research that may be opened by the application of emerging technologies for engineering recombinant antibodies for enhanced utility in ion channel research. Overall, this review provides insights that may help stimulate and guide interested researchers to develop and incorporate renewable and recombinant antibodies as valuable tools to control ion channel function.",

        "Abstract": "Plasma membrane-localized ion channels are essential for diverse physiological processes such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and osmotic homeostasis. The surface density of such ion channels is a major determinant of their function, and tuning this variable is a powerful way to regulate physiology. Dysregulation of ion channel surface density due to inherited or de novo mutations underlies many serious diseases, and molecules that can correct trafficking deficits are potential therapeutics and useful research tools. We have developed targeted ubiquitination and deubiquitination approaches that enable selective posttranslational down- or up-regulation, respectively, of desired ion channels. The method employs bivalent molecules comprised of an ion-channel-targeted nanobody fused to catalytic domains of either an E3 ubiquitin ligase or a deubiquitinase. Here, we use two examples to provide detailed protocols that illustrate the utility of the approach-rescued surface expression of a trafficking-deficient mutant K",

        "Abstract": "Impaired protein stability or trafficking underlies diverse ion channelopathies and represents an unexploited unifying principle for developing common treatments for otherwise dissimilar diseases. Ubiquitination limits ion channel surface density, but targeting this pathway for the purposes of basic study or therapy is challenging because of its prevalent role in proteostasis. We developed engineered deubiquitinases (enDUBs) that enable selective ubiquitin chain removal from target proteins to rescue the functional expression of disparate mutant ion channels that underlie long QT syndrome (LQT) and cystic fibrosis (CF). In an LQT type 1 (LQT1) cardiomyocyte model, enDUB treatment restored delayed rectifier potassium currents and normalized action potential duration. CF-targeted enDUBs synergistically rescued common (\u0394F508) and pharmacotherapy-resistant (N1303K) CF mutations when combined with the US Food and Drug Administation (FDA)-approved drugs Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and Trikafta (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor). Altogether, targeted deubiquitination via enDUBs provides a powerful protein stabilization method that not only corrects diverse diseases caused by impaired ion channel trafficking, but also introduces a new tool for deconstructing the ubiquitin code in situ.",

        "Abstract": "Inhibition of voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels is a potential therapy for many neurological diseases including chronic pain. Neuronal CaV1/CaV2 channels are composed of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b12\u03b4 subunits. The \u03b2 subunits of CaV channels are cytoplasmic proteins that increase the surface expression of the pore-forming \u03b1 subunit of CaV. We targeted the high-affinity protein-protein interface of CaV\u03b2's pocket within the CaV\u03b1 subunit. Structure-based virtual screening of 50,000 small molecule library docked to the \u03b2 subunit led to the identification of 2-(3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)-N-((4-((3-phenylpropyl)amino)quinazolin-2-yl)methyl)acetamide (IPPQ). This small molecule bound to CaV\u03b2 and inhibited its coupling with N-type voltage-gated calcium (CaV2.2) channels, leading to a reduction in CaV2.2 currents in rat dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons, decreased presynaptic localization of CaV2.2 in vivo, decreased frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials and miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials, and inhibited release of the nociceptive neurotransmitter calcitonin gene-related peptide from spinal cord. IPPQ did not target opioid receptors nor did it engage inhibitory G protein-coupled receptor signaling. IPPQ was antinociceptive in naive animals and reversed allodynia and hyperalgesia in models of acute (postsurgical) and neuropathic (spinal nerve ligation, chemotherapy- and gp120-induced peripheral neuropathy, and genome-edited neuropathy) pain. IPPQ did not cause akinesia or motor impairment, a common adverse effect of CaV2.2 targeting drugs, when injected into the brain. IPPQ, a quinazoline analog, represents a novel class of CaV2.2-targeting compounds that may serve as probes to interrogate CaV\u03b1-CaV\u03b2 function and ultimately be developed as a nonopioid therapeutic for chronic pain.",

        "Abstract": "Ca2+ channel \u03b2-subunit interactions with pore-forming \u03b1-subunits are long-thought to be obligatory for channel trafficking to the cell surface and for tuning of basal biophysical properties in many tissues. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that transgenic expression of mutant \u03b11C subunits lacking capacity to bind CaV\u03b2 can traffic to the sarcolemma in adult cardiomyocytes in vivo and sustain normal excitation-contraction coupling. However, these \u03b2-less Ca2+ channels cannot be stimulated by \u03b2-adrenergic pathway agonists, and thus adrenergic augmentation of contractility is markedly impaired in isolated cardiomyocytes and in hearts. Similarly, viral-mediated expression of a \u03b2-subunit-sequestering peptide sharply curtailed \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation of WT Ca2+ channels, identifying an approach to specifically modulate \u03b2-adrenergic regulation of cardiac contractility. Our data demonstrate that \u03b2 subunits are required for \u03b2-adrenergic regulation of CaV1.2 channels and positive inotropy in the heart, but are dispensable for CaV1.2 trafficking to the adult cardiomyocyte cell surface, and for basal function and excitation-contraction coupling.",

        "Abstract": "Currently available inhibitory optogenetic tools provide short and transient silencing of neurons, but they cannot provide long-lasting inhibition because of the requirement for high light intensities. Here we present an optimized blue-light-sensitive synthetic potassium channel, BLINK2, which showed good expression in neurons in three species. The channel is activated by illumination with low doses of blue light, and in our experiments it remained active over (tens of) minutes in the dark after the illumination was stopped. This activation caused long periods of inhibition of neuronal firing in ex vivo recordings of mouse neurons and impaired motor neuron response in zebrafish in vivo. As a proof-of-concept application, we demonstrated that in a freely moving rat model of neuropathic pain, the activation of a small number of BLINK2 channels caused a long-lasting (>30\u2009min) reduction in pain sensation.",

        "Abstract": "The functional repertoire of surface ion channels is sustained by dynamic processes of trafficking, sorting, and degradation. Dysregulation of these processes underlies diverse ion channelopathies including cardiac arrhythmias and cystic fibrosis. Ubiquitination powerfully regulates multiple steps in the channel lifecycle, yet basic mechanistic understanding is confounded by promiscuity among E3 ligase/substrate interactions and ubiquitin code complexity. Here we targeted the catalytic domain of E3 ligase, CHIP, to YFP-tagged KCNQ1 \u00b1 KCNE1 subunits with a GFP-nanobody to selectively manipulate this channel complex in heterologous cells and adult rat cardiomyocytes. Engineered CHIP enhanced KCNQ1 ubiquitination, eliminated KCNQ1 surface-density, and abolished reconstituted K",

        "Title": "Inhibition of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) prevents sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy by improving calcium handling and mitochondrial function.",
        "Abstract": "Cardiomyopathy frequently complicates sepsis and is associated with increased mortality. Increased cardiac oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been observed during sepsis, but the mechanisms responsible for these abnormalities have not been determined. We hypothesized that NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) activation could be responsible for sepsis-induced oxidative stress and cardiomyopathy. Treatment of isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes with low concentrations of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased total cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide. Elevated mitochondrial superoxide was accompanied by depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential, an indication of mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitochondrial calcium overload. NOX2 inhibition decreased LPS-induced superoxide and prevented mitochondrial dysfunction. Further, cardiomyocytes from mice with genetic ablation of NOX2 did not have LPS-induced superoxide or mitochondrial dysfunction. LPS decreased contractility and calcium transient amplitude in isolated cardiomyocytes, and these abnormalities were prevented by inhibition of NOX2. LPS decreased systolic function in mice, measured by echocardiography. NOX2 inhibition was cardioprotective in 2 mouse models of sepsis, preserving systolic function after LPS injection or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). These data show that inhibition of NOX2 decreases oxidative stress, preserves intracellular calcium handling and mitochondrial function, and alleviates sepsis-induced systolic dysfunction in vivo. Thus, NOX2 is a potential target for pharmacotherapy of sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.",

This deleterious effect is poorly understood, and thus strategies to avoid this side effect remain elusive. We show here that fluoxetine (Flx), one of the most-prescribed SSRIs, acts on bone remodeling through two distinct mechanisms. Peripherally, Flx has anti-resorptive properties, directly impairing osteoclast differentiation and function through a serotonin-reuptake-independent mechanism that is dependent on intracellular Ca",

        "Abstract": "Human calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that maintains extracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis through the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion. It functions as a disulfide-tethered homodimer composed of three main domains, the Venus Flytrap module, cysteine-rich domain, and seven-helix transmembrane region. Here, we present the crystal structures of the entire extracellular domain of CaSR in the resting and active conformations. We provide direct evidence that L-amino acids are agonists of the receptor. In the active structure, L-Trp occupies the orthosteric agonist-binding site at the interdomain cleft and is primarily responsible for inducing extracellular domain closure to initiate receptor activation. Our structures reveal multiple binding sites for Ca(2+) and PO4(3-) ions. Both ions are crucial for structural integrity of the receptor. While Ca(2+) ions stabilize the active state, PO4(3-) ions reinforce the inactive conformation. The activation mechanism of CaSR involves the formation of a novel dimer interface between subunits.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity is associated with hyperlipidemia, electrical remodeling of the heart, and increased risk of supraventricular arrhythmias in both male and female patients. The delayed rectifier K(+) current (IK), is an important regulator of atrial repolarization. There is a paucity of studies on the functional role of IK in response to obesity. Here, we assessed the obesity-mediated functional modulation of IK in low-fat diet (LFD), and high-fat diet (HFD) fed adult guinea pigs. Guinea pigs were randomly divided into control and obese groups fed, ad libitum, with a LFD (10\u00a0kcal% fat) or a HFD (45\u00a0kcal% fat) respectively. Action potential duration (APD), and IK were studied in atrial myocytes and IKr and IKs in HEK293\u00a0cells using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. HFD guinea pigs displayed a significant increase in body weight, total cholesterol and total triglycerides within 50 days. Atrial APD at 30% (APD30) and 90% (APD90) repolarization were shorter, while atrial IK density was significantly increased in HFD guinea pigs. Exposure to palmitic acid (PA) increased heterologously expressed IKr and IKs densities, while oleic acid (OA), severely reduced IKr and had no effect on IKs. The data are first to show that in obese guinea pigs abbreviated APD is due to increased IK density likely through elevations of PA. Our findings may have crucial implications for targeted treatment options for obesity-related arrhythmias.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity and high saturated fat intake increase the risk of heart failure and arrhythmias. The molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that physiologic levels of saturated fat could increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiomyocytes, leading to abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function. We investigated the effect of saturated fat on mitochondrial function and calcium homeostasis in isolated ventricular myocytes. The saturated fatty acid palmitate causes a decrease in mitochondrial respiration in cardiomyocytes. Palmitate, but not the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate, causes an increase in both total cellular ROS and mitochondrial ROS. Palmitate depolarizes the mitochondrial inner membrane and causes mitochondrial calcium overload by increasing sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak. Inhibitors of PKC or NOX2 prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and the increase in ROS, demonstrating that PKC-NOX2 activation is also required for amplification of palmitate induced-ROS. Cardiomyocytes from mice with genetic deletion of NOX2 do not have palmitate-induced ROS or mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that palmitate induces mitochondrial ROS that is amplified by NOX2, causing greater mitochondrial ROS generation and partial depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The abnormal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak caused by palmitate could promote arrhythmia and heart failure. NOX2 inhibition is a potential therapy for heart disease caused by diabetes or obesity.",

        "Abstract": "Rad and Rem are Ras-like G-proteins linked to diverse cardiovascular functions and pathophysiology. Understanding how Rad and Rem are regulated is important for deepened insights into their pathophysiological roles. As in other Ras-like G-proteins, Rad and Rem contain a conserved guanine-nucleotide binding domain (G-domain). Canonically, G-domains are key control modules, functioning as nucleotide-regulated switches of G-protein activity. Whether Rad and Rem G-domains conform to this canonical paradigm is ambiguous. Here, we used multiple functional measurements in HEK293 cells and cardiomyocytes (Ca(V)1.2 currents, Ca(2+) transients, Ca(V)\u03b2 binding) as biosensors to probe the role of the G-domain in regulation of Rad and Rem function. We utilized Rad(S105N) and Rem(T94N), which are the cognate mutants to Ras(S17N), a dominant-negative variant of Ras that displays decreased nucleotide binding affinity. In HEK293 cells, over-expression of either Rad(S105N) or Rem(T94N) strongly inhibited reconstituted Ca(V)1.2 currents to the same extent as their wild-type (wt) counterparts, contrasting with reports that Rad(S105N) is functionally inert in HEK293 cells. Adenovirus-mediated expression of either wt Rad or Rad(S105N) in cardiomyocytes dramatically blocked L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)) and inhibited Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release, contradicting reports that Rad(S105N) acts as a dominant negative in heart. By contrast, Rem(T94N) was significantly less effective than wt Rem at inhibiting I(Ca,L) and Ca(2+) transients in cardiomyocytes. FRET analyses in cardiomyocytes revealed that both Rad(S105N) and Rem(T94N) had moderately reduced binding affinity for Ca(V)\u03b2s relative to their wt counterparts. The results indicate Rad and Rem are non-canonical G-proteins with respect to the regulatory role of their G-domain in Ca(V)1.2 regulation.",

        "Abstract": "Ca(2+)-activated chloride channels encoded by TMEM16A and 16B are important for regulating epithelial mucus secretion, cardiac and neuronal excitability, smooth muscle contraction, olfactory transduction, and cell proliferation. Whether and how the ubiquitous Ca(2+) sensor calmodulin (CaM) regulates the activity of TMEM16A and 16B channels has been controversial and the subject of an ongoing debate. Recently, using a bioengineering approach termed ChIMP (Channel Inactivation induced by Membrane-tethering of an associated Protein) we argued that Ca(2+)-free CaM (apoCaM) is pre-associated with functioning TMEM16A and 16B channel complexes in live cells. Further, the pre-associated apoCaM mediates Ca(2+)-dependent sensitization of activation (CDSA) and Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation (CDI) of some TMEM16A splice variants. In this review, we discuss these findings in the context of previous and recent results relating to Ca(2+)-dependent regulation of TMEM16A/16B channels and the putative role of CaM. We further discuss potential future directions for these nascent ideas on apoCaM regulation of TMEM16A/16B channels, noting that such future efforts will benefit greatly from the pioneering work of Dr. David T. Yue and colleagues on CaM regulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels.",

        "Abstract": "Ca(2+)-activated chloride currents carried via transmembrane proteins TMEM16A and TMEM16B regulate diverse processes including mucus secretion, neuronal excitability, smooth muscle contraction, olfactory signal transduction, and cell proliferation. Understanding how TMEM16A/16B are regulated by Ca(2+) is critical for defining their (patho)/physiological roles and for rationally targeting them therapeutically. Here, using a bioengineering approach--channel inactivation induced by membrane-tethering of an associated protein (ChIMP)--we discovered that Ca(2+)-free calmodulin (apoCaM) is preassociated with TMEM16A/16B channel complexes. The resident apoCaM mediates two distinct Ca(2+)-dependent effects on TMEM16A, as revealed by expression of dominant-negative CaM1234. These effects are Ca(2+)-dependent sensitization of activation (CDSA) and Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation (CDI). CDI and CDSA are independently mediated by the N and C lobes of CaM, respectively. TMEM16A alternative splicing provides a mechanism for tuning apoCaM effects. Channels lacking splice segment b selectively lost CDI, and segment a is necessary for apoCaM preassociation with TMEM16A. The results reveal multidimensional regulation of TMEM16A/16B by preassociated apoCaM and introduce ChIMP as a versatile tool to probe the macromolecular complex and function of Ca(2+)-activated chloride channels.",

KpBest is a pentamer that forms a five-helix transmembrane pore, closed by three rings of conserved hydrophobic residues, and has a cytoplasmic cavern with a restricted exit. From electrophysiological analysis of structure-inspired mutations in KpBest and hBest1, we find a sensitive control of ion selectivity in the bestrophins, including reversal of anion/cation selectivity, and dramatic activation by mutations at the cytoplasmic exit. A homology model of hBest1 shows the locations of disease-causing mutations and suggests possible roles in regulation.",

This phenomenon is essential for life and underlies many critical homeostatic processes in cells. Ion channels are diverse and differ with respect to how they open and close (gating) and to their ionic conductance/selectivity (permeation). Fundamental understanding of ion channel structure-function mechanisms, their physiological roles, how their dysfunction leads to disease, their utility as biosensors, and development of novel molecules to modulate their activity are important and active research frontiers. In this review, we focus on ion channel engineering approaches that have been applied to investigate these aspects of ion channel function, with a major emphasis on voltage-gated ion channels.",

        "Abstract": "Ca(2+) influx via voltage-dependent CaV1/CaV2 channels couples electrical signals to biological responses in excitable cells. CaV1/CaV2 channel blockers have broad biotechnological and therapeutic applications. Here we report a general method for developing novel genetically encoded calcium channel blockers inspired by Rem, a small G-protein that constitutively inhibits CaV1/CaV2 channels. We show that diverse cytosolic proteins (CaV\u03b2, 14-3-3, calmodulin and CaMKII) that bind pore-forming \u03b11-subunits can be converted into calcium channel blockers with tunable selectivity, kinetics and potency, simply by anchoring them to the plasma membrane. We term this method 'channel inactivation induced by membrane-tethering of an associated protein' (ChIMP). ChIMP is potentially extendable to small-molecule drug discovery, as engineering FK506-binding protein into intracellular sites within CaV1.2-\u03b11C permits heterodimerization-initiated channel inhibition with rapamycin. The results reveal a universal method for developing novel calcium channel blockers that may be extended to develop probes for a broad cohort of unrelated ion channels.",

        "Abstract": "Manipulating expression of large genes (>6 kb) in adult cardiomyocytes is challenging because these cells are only efficiently transduced by viral vectors with a 4-7 kb packaging capacity. This limitation impedes understanding structure-function mechanisms of important proteins in heart. L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) regulate diverse facets of cardiac physiology including excitation-contraction coupling, excitability, and gene expression. Many important questions about how LTCCs mediate such multidimensional signaling are best resolved by manipulating expression of the 6.6 kb pore-forming \u03b11C-subunit in adult cardiomyocytes. Here, we use split-intein-mediated protein transsplicing to reconstitute LTCC \u03b11C-subunit from two distinct halves, overcoming the difficulty of expressing full-length \u03b11C in cardiomyocytes. Split-intein-tagged \u03b11C fragments encoding dihydropyridine-resistant channels were incorporated into adenovirus and reconstituted in cardiomyocytes. Similar to endogenous LTCCs, recombinant channels targeted to dyads, triggered Ca(2+) transients, associated with caveolin-3, and supported \u03b2-adrenergic regulation of excitation-contraction coupling. This approach lowers a longstanding technical hurdle to manipulating large proteins in cardiomyocytes.",

        "Abstract": "In the heart, Ca(2+) influx via Ca(V)1.2 L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) is a multi-functional signal that triggers muscle contraction, controls action potential duration, and regulates gene expression. The use of LTCC Ca(2+) as a multi-dimensional signalling molecule in the heart is complicated by several aspects of cardiac physiology. Cytosolic Ca(2+) continuously cycles between ~100 nM and ~1 \u03bcM with each heartbeat due to Ca(2+) linked signalling from LTCCs to ryanodine receptors. This rapid cycling raises the question as to how cardiac myocytes distinguish the Ca(2+) fluxes originating through L-type channels that are dedicated to contraction from Ca(2+) fluxes originating from other L-type channels that are used for non-contraction-related signalling. In general, disparate Ca(2+) sources in cardiac myocytes such as current through differently localized LTCCs as well as from IP3 receptors can signal selectively to Ca(2+)-dependent effectors in local microdomains that can be impervious to the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) transients that drive contraction. A particular challenge for diversified signalling via cardiac LTCCs is that they are voltage-gated and, therefore, open and presumably flood their microdomains with Ca(2+) with each action potential. Thus spatial localization of Cav1.2 channels to different types of microdomains of the ventricular cardiomyocyte membrane as well as the existence of particular macromolecular complexes in each Cav1.2 microdomain are important to effect different types of Cav1.2 signalling. In this review we examine aspects of Cav1.2 structure, targeting and signalling in two specialized membrane microdomains--transverse tubules and caveolae.",

        "Abstract": "Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channels, comprised of pore-forming \u03b1(1) and auxiliary (\u03b2,\u03b1(2)\u03b4) subunits, control diverse biological responses in excitable cells. Molecules blocking Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channel currents (I(Ca)) profoundly regulate physiology and have many therapeutic applications. Rad/Rem/Rem2/Gem GTPases (RGKs) strongly inhibit Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channels. Understanding how RGKs block I(Ca) is critical for insights into their physiological function, and may provide design principles for developing novel Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channel inhibitors. The RGK binding sites within Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channel complexes responsible for I(Ca) inhibition are ambiguous, and it is unclear whether there are mechanistic differences among distinct RGKs. All RGKs bind \u03b2 subunits, but it is unknown if and how this interaction contributes to I(Ca) inhibition. We investigated the role of RGK/\u03b2 interaction in Rem inhibition of recombinant Ca(V)1.2 channels, using a mutated \u03b2 (\u03b2(2aTM)) selectively lacking RGK binding. Rem blocked \u03b2(2aTM)-reconstituted channels (74% inhibition) less potently than channels containing wild-type \u03b2(2a) (96% inhibition), suggesting the prevalence of both \u03b2-binding-dependent and independent modes of inhibition. Two mechanistic signatures of Rem inhibition of Ca(V)1.2 channels (decreased channel surface density and open probability), but not a third (reduced maximal gating charge), depended on Rem binding to \u03b2. We identified a novel Rem binding site in Ca(V)1.2 \u03b1(1C) N-terminus that mediated \u03b2-binding-independent inhibition. The Ca(V)2.2 \u03b1(1B) subunit lacks the Rem binding site in the N-terminus and displays a solely \u03b2-binding-dependent form of channel inhibition. Finally, we discovered an unexpected functional dichotomy amongst distinct RGKs- while Rem and Rad use both \u03b2-binding-dependent and independent mechanisms, Gem and Rem2 use only a \u03b2-binding-dependent method to inhibit Ca(V)1.2 channels. The results provide new mechanistic perspectives, and reveal unexpected variations in determinants, underlying inhibition of Ca(V)1.2/Ca(V)2.2 channels by distinct RGK GTPases.",

        "Abstract": "Ca(2+) influx via Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channels drives processes ranging from neurotransmission to muscle contraction. Association of a pore-forming \u03b1(1) and cytosolic \u03b2 is necessary for trafficking Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channels to the cell surface through poorly understood mechanisms. A prevalent idea suggests \u03b2 binds the \u03b1(1) intracellular I-II loop, masking an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal as the dominant mechanism for Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channel membrane trafficking. There are hints that other \u03b1(1) subunit cytoplasmic domains may play a significant role, but the nature of their potential contribution is unclear. We assessed the roles of all intracellular domains of Ca(V)1.2-\u03b1(1C) by generating chimeras featuring substitutions of all possible permutations of intracellular loops/termini of \u03b1(1C) into the \u03b2-independent Ca(V)3.1-\u03b1(1G) channel. Surprisingly, functional analyses demonstrated \u03b1(1C) I-II loop strongly increases channel surface density while other cytoplasmic domains had a competing opposing effect. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis identified an acidic-residue putative ER export motif responsible for the I-II loop-mediated increase in channel surface density. \u03b2-dependent increase in current arose as an emergent property requiring four \u03b1(1C) intracellular domains, with the I-II loop and C-terminus being essential. The results suggest \u03b2 binding to the \u03b1(1C) I-II loop causes a C-terminus-dependent rearrangement of intracellular domains, shifting a balance of power between export signals on the I-II loop and retention signals elsewhere.",

        "Abstract": "Rad/Rem/Gem/Kir (RGK) GTPases potently inhibit Ca(V)1 and Ca(V)2 (Ca(V)1-2) channels, a paradigm of ion channel regulation by monomeric G-proteins with significant physiological ramifications and potential biotechnology applications. The mechanism(s) underlying how RGK proteins inhibit I(Ca) is unknown, and it is unclear how key structural and regulatory properties of these GTPases (such as the role of GTP binding to the nucleotide binding domain (NBD), and the C-terminus which contains a membrane-targeting motif) feature in this effect. Here, we show that Rem inhibits Ca(V)1.2 channels by three independent mechanisms that rely on distinct configurations of the GTPase: (1) a reduction in surface density of channels is accomplished by enhancing dynamin-dependent endocytosis, (2) a diminution of channel open probability (P(o)) that occurs without impacting on voltage sensor movement, and (3) an immobilization of Ca(V) channel voltage sensors. The presence of both the Rem NBD and C-terminus (whether membrane-targeted or not) in one molecule is sufficient to reconstitute all three mechanisms. However, membrane localization of the NBD by a generic membrane-targeting module reconstitutes only the decreased P(o) function (mechanism 2). A point mutation that prevents GTP binding to the NBD selectively eliminates the capacity to immobilize voltage sensors (mechanism 3). The results reveal an uncommon multiplicity in the mechanisms Rem uses to inhibit I(Ca), predict new physiological dimensions of the RGK GTPase-Ca(V) channel crosstalk, and suggest original approaches for developing novel Ca(V) channel blockers.",

        "Title": "BIN1 localizes the L-type calcium channel to cardiac T-tubules.",
        "Abstract": "The BAR domain protein superfamily is involved in membrane invagination and endocytosis, but its role in organizing membrane proteins has not been explored. In particular, the membrane scaffolding protein BIN1 functions to initiate T-tubule genesis in skeletal muscle cells. Constitutive knockdown of BIN1 in mice is perinatal lethal, which is associated with an induced dilated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the functional role of BIN1 in cardiomyocytes is not known. An important function of cardiac T-tubules is to allow L-type calcium channels (Cav1.2) to be in close proximity to sarcoplasmic reticulum-based ryanodine receptors to initiate the intracellular calcium transient. Efficient excitation-contraction (EC) coupling and normal cardiac contractility depend upon Cav1.2 localization to T-tubules. We hypothesized that BIN1 not only exists at cardiac T-tubules, but it also localizes Cav1.2 to these membrane structures. We report that BIN1 localizes to cardiac T-tubules and clusters there with Cav1.2. Studies involve freshly acquired human and mouse adult cardiomyocytes using complementary immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy with dual immunogold labeling, and co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, we use surface biotinylation and live cell confocal and total internal fluorescence microscopy imaging in cardiomyocytes and cell lines to explore delivery of Cav1.2 to BIN1 structures. We find visually and quantitatively that dynamic microtubules are tethered to membrane scaffolded by BIN1, allowing targeted delivery of Cav1.2 from the microtubules to the associated membrane. Since Cav1.2 delivery to BIN1 occurs in reductionist non-myocyte cell lines, we find that other myocyte-specific structures are not essential and there is an intrinsic relationship between microtubule-based Cav1.2 delivery and its BIN1 scaffold. In differentiated mouse cardiomyocytes, knockdown of BIN1 reduces surface Cav1.2 and delays development of the calcium transient, indicating that Cav1.2 targeting to BIN1 is functionally important to cardiac calcium signaling. We have identified that membrane-associated BIN1 not only induces membrane curvature but can direct specific antegrade delivery of microtubule-transported membrane proteins. Furthermore, this paradigm provides a microtubule and BIN1-dependent mechanism of Cav1.2 delivery to T-tubules. This novel Cav1.2 trafficking pathway should serve as an important regulatory aspect of EC coupling, affecting cardiac contractility in mammalian hearts.",

Nevertheless, the full potential for Ca(V) channel inhibition is not being realized by currently available small-molecule blockers or second-messenger modulators due to limitations in targeting them either to defined groups of cells in an organism or to distinct subcellular regions within a single cell.

        "Abstract": "Protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated enhancement of L-type calcium currents (I(Ca,L)) is essential for sympathetic regulation of the heartbeat and is the classic example of channel regulation by phosphorylation, and its loss is a common hallmark of heart failure. Mechanistic understanding of how distinct Ca(V) channel subunits contribute to PKA modulation of I(Ca,L) has been intensely pursued yet remains elusive. Moreover, critical features of this regulation such as its functional reserve (the surplus capacity available for modulation) in the heart are unknown. Here, we use an overexpression paradigm in heart cells to simultaneously identify the impact of auxiliary Ca(V)betas on PKA modulation of I(Ca,L) and to gauge the functional reserve of this regulation in the heart. Ca(V)1.2 channels containing wild-type beta(2a) or a phosphorylation-deficient mutant (beta(2a,AAA)) were equally upregulated by PKA, discounting a necessary role for beta phosphorylation. Nevertheless, channels reconstituted with beta(2a) displayed a significantly diminished PKA response compared with other beta isoforms, an effect explainable by a uniquely higher basal P(o) of beta(2a) channels. Overexpression of all betas increased basal current density, accompanied by a concomitant decrease in the magnitude of PKA regulation. Scatter plots of fold increase in current against basal current density revealed an inverse relationship that was conserved across species and conformed to a model in which a large fraction of channels remained unmodified after PKA activation. These results redefine the role of beta subunits in PKA modulation of Ca(V)1.2 channels and uncover a new design principle of this phenomenon in the heart, vis \u00e0 vis a limited functional reserve.",

        "Abstract": "Spatially patterned gene expression drives tissue organization and is a critical determinant of tissue function. Approaches in functional tissue engineering will require not only the spatial organization of cells but also control of their gene expression patterns. We report a method to generate patterns of gene expression within a monolayer of cells by using surface-immobilized recombinant adenovirus. This study represents a new approach to engineering tissues that relies on controlling spatial patterns of gene expression, and can be used independently or in combination with positioning of different cell types. This technique may have broad applications in biotechnology including tissue engineering and targeted gene delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Voltage-gated Ca2+ (Ca(V)) channels are central to the biology of excitable cells, and therefore regulating their activity has widespread applications. We describe genetically encoded molecules for inducibly inhibiting Ca(V) channels (GEMIICCs). GEMIICCs are derivatives of Rem, a Ras-like GTPase that constitutively inhibits Ca2+ currents (I(Ca)). C terminus-truncated Rem(1-265) lost the ability to inhibit I(Ca) owing to loss of membrane targeting. Fusing the C1 domain of protein kinase Cgamma to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-Rem(1-265) generated a molecule that rapidly translocated from cytosol to plasma membrane with phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate in human embryonic kidney cells. Recombinant Ca(V)2.2 and Ca(V)1.2 channels were inhibited concomitantly with C1(PKCgamma)-YFP-Rem(1-265) membrane translocation. The generality of the approach was confirmed by creating a GEMIICC using rapamycin-dependent heterodimerization of YFP-FKBP-Rem(1-265) and a constitutively membrane-targeted rapamycin-binding domain. GEMIICCs reduced I(Ca) without diminishing gating charge, thereby ruling out decreased number of surface channels and voltage-sensor immobilization as mechanisms for inhibition. We introduce small-molecule-regulated GEMIICCs as potent tools for rapidly manipulating Ca2+ signals in excitable cells.",

        "Abstract": "Auxiliary Ca(2+) channel beta subunits (Ca(V)beta) regulate cellular Ca(2+) signaling by trafficking pore-forming alpha(1) subunits to the membrane and normalizing channel gating. These effects are mediated through a characteristic src homology 3/guanylate kinase (SH3-GK) structural module, a design feature shared in common with the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family of scaffold proteins. However, the mechanisms by which the Ca(V)beta SH3-GK module regulates multiple Ca(2+) channel functions are not well understood. Here, using a split-domain approach, we investigated the role of the interrelationship between Ca(V)beta SH3 and GK domains in defining channel properties. The studies build upon a previously identified split-domain pair that displays a trans SH3-GK interaction, and fully reconstitutes Ca(V)beta effects on channel trafficking, activation gating, and increased open probability (P(o)). Here, by varying the precise locations used to separate SH3 and GK domains and monitoring subsequent SH3-GK interactions by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we identified a particular split-domain pair that displayed a subtly altered configuration of the trans SH3-GK interaction. Remarkably, this pair discriminated between Ca(V)beta trafficking and gating properties: alpha(1C) targeting to the membrane was fully reconstituted, whereas shifts in activation gating and increased P(o) functions were selectively lost. A more extreme case, in which the trans SH3-GK interaction was selectively ablated, yielded a split-domain pair that could reconstitute neither the trafficking nor gating-modulation functions, even though both moieties could independently engage their respective binding sites on the alpha(1C) (Ca(V)1.2) subunit. The results reveal that Ca(V)beta SH3 and GK domains function codependently to tune Ca(2+) channel trafficking and gating properties, and suggest new paradigms for physiological and therapeutic regulation of Ca(2+) channel activity.",

        "Title": "A single CaVbeta can reconstitute both trafficking and macroscopic conductance of voltage-dependent calcium channels.",
        "Abstract": "Voltage-dependent calcium-channel beta subunits (Ca(V)beta) strongly modulate pore-forming alpha(1) subunits by trafficking channel complexes to the plasma membrane and enhancing channel open probability (P(o)). Despite their central role, it is unclear whether binding of a single Ca(V)beta, or multiple Ca(V)betas, to an alpha(1) subunit governs the two distinct functions. Conventional experiments utilizing coexpression of alpha(1) and Ca(V)beta subunits have been unable to resolve the ambiguity due to difficulties in establishing their stoichiometry in functional channels. Here, we unambiguously establish a 1: 1 stoichiometry by covalently linking Ca(V)beta(2b) to the carboxyl terminus of alpha(1C) (Ca(V)1.2), creating alpha(1C).beta(2b). Recombinant L-type channels reconstituted in HEK 293 cells with alpha(1C).beta(2b) supported whole-cell currents to the same extent as channels reconstituted via coexpression of the individual subunits. Analysis of gating charge showed alpha(1C).beta(2b) fully restored channel trafficking to the plasma membrane. Co-transfecting Ca(V)beta(2a) with alpha(1C).beta(2b) had little further impact on function. To rule out the possibility that fused Ca(V)beta(2b) was interacting in trans with neighbouring alpha(1) molecules, alpha(1C).beta(2b) was cotransfected with alpha(1B) (Ca(V)2.2), and pharmacological block with nimodipine showed an absence of alpha(1B) trafficking. These results establish that association of a single Ca(V)beta with a pore-forming alpha(1) subunit captures the functional essence of HVA calcium channels, and introduce alpha(1)-Ca(V)beta fusion proteins as a powerful new tool to probe structure-function mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Voltage-dependent G protein (Gbetagamma) inhibition of N-type (CaV2.2) channels supports presynaptic inhibition and represents a central paradigm of channel modulation. Still controversial are the proposed determinants for such modulation, which reside on the principal alpha1B channel subunit. These include the interdomain I-II loop (I-II), the carboxy tail (CT), and the amino terminus (NT). Here, we probed these determinants and related mechanisms, utilizing compound-state analysis with yeast two-hybrid and mammalian cell FRET assays of binding among channel segments and G proteins. Chimeric channels confirmed the unique importance of NT. Binding assays revealed selective interaction between NT and I-II elements. Coexpressing NT peptide with Gbetagamma induced constitutive channel inhibition, suggesting that the NT domain constitutes a G protein-gated inhibitory module. Such inhibition was limited to NT regions interacting with I-II, and G-protein inhibition was abolished within alpha1B channels lacking these NT regions. Thus, an NT module, acting via interactions with the I-II loop, appears fundamental to such modulation.",

        "Abstract": "The alpha(1c) subunit of the cardiac L-type Ca(2+) channel, which contains the channel pore, voltage- and Ca(2+)-dependent gating structures, and drug binding sites, has been well studied in heterologous expression systems, but many aspects of L-type Ca(2+) channel behavior in intact cardiomyocytes remain poorly characterized. Here, we develop adenoviral constructs with E1, E3 and fiber gene deletions, to allow incorporation of full-length alpha(1c) gene cassettes into the adenovirus backbone. Wild-type (alpha(1c-wt)) and mutant (alpha(1c-D-)) Ca(2+) channel adenoviruses were constructed. The alpha(1c-D-) contained four point substitutions at amino acid residues known to be critical for dihydropyridine binding. Both alpha(1c-wt) and alpha(1c-D-) expressed robustly in A549 cells (peak L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)) at 0 mV: alpha(1c-wt) -9.94+/-1.00pA/pF, n=9; alpha(1c-D-) -10.30pA/pF, n=12). I(CaL) carried by alpha(1c-D-) was markedly less sensitive to nitrendipine (IC(50) 17.1 microM) than alpha(1c-wt) (IC(50) 88 nM); a feature exploited to discriminate between engineered and native currents in transduced guinea-pig myocytes. 10 microM nitrendipine blocked only 51+/-5% (n=9) of I(CaL) in alpha(1c-D-)-expressing myocytes, in comparison to 86+/-8% (n=9) of I(CaL) in control myocytes. Moreover, in 20 microM nitrendipine, calcium transients could still be evoked in alpha(1c-D-)-transduced cells, but were largely blocked in control myocytes, indicating that the engineered channels were coupled to sarcoplasmic reticular Ca(2+) release. These alpha(1c) adenoviruses provide an unprecedented tool for structure-function studies of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and L-type Ca(2+) channel regulation in the native myocyte background.",

        "Abstract": "High-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels regulate diverse functions ranging from muscle contraction to synaptic transmission. Association between auxiliary beta- and distinct pore-forming alpha1-subunits is obligatory for forming functional high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, yet the structural determinants underlying this interaction remain poorly understood. Recently, homology modeling of Ca(2+)-channel beta1b-subunit identified src homology 3 (SH3) and guanylate kinase (GK) motifs in a tandem arrangement reminiscent of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) class of scaffolding proteins. However, direct evidence for MAGUK-like properties and their functional implications in beta-subunits is lacking. Here, we show a functional requirement for both SH3 and GK domains in beta2a. Point mutations in either the putative beta2a SH3 or GK domains severely blunted modulation of recombinant L-type channels, showing the importance of both motifs for a functional alpha1-beta interaction. Coexpression of these functionally deficient beta2a-SH3 and GK mutants rescued WT currents, demonstrating trans complementation similar to that observed in MAGUKs. Truncated \"hemi-beta2a\" subunits, containing either the SH3 or GK domain, were ineffective on their own, but reconstituted WT currents when coexpressed. Moreover, the SH3 and GK domains were found to interact in vitro. These findings reveal MAGUK-like properties in beta-subunits that are critical for alpha1-subunit modulation, revise current models of alpha1-beta association, and predict new physiological dimensions of beta-subunit function.",

        "Title": "Custom distinctions in the interaction of G-protein beta subunits with N-type (CaV2.2) versus P/Q-type (CaV2.1) calcium channels.",
        "Abstract": "Inhibition of N- (Cav2.2) and P/Q-type (Cav2.1) calcium channels by G-proteins contribute importantly to presynaptic inhibition as well as to the effects of opiates and cannabinoids. Accordingly, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying G-protein inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels has been a major research focus. So far, inhibition is thought to result from the interaction of multiple proposed sites with the Gbetagamma complex (Gbetagamma). Far less is known about the important interaction sites on Gbetagamma itself. Here, we developed a novel electrophysiological paradigm, \"compound-state willing-reluctant analysis,\" to describe Gbetagamma interaction with N- and P/Q-type channels, and to provide a sensitive and efficient screen for changes in modulatory behavior over a broad range of potentials. The analysis confirmed that the apparent (un)binding kinetics of Gbetagamma with N-type are twofold slower than with P/Q-type at the voltage extremes, and emphasized that the kinetic discrepancy increases up to ten-fold in the mid-voltage range. To further investigate apparent differences in modulatory behavior, we screened both channels for the effects of single point alanine mutations within four regions of Gbeta1, at residues known to interact with Galpha. These residues might thereby be expected to interact with channel effectors. Of eight mutations studied, six affected G-protein modulation of both N- and P/Q-type channels to varying degrees, and one had no appreciable effect on either channel. The remaining mutation was remarkable for selective attenuation of effects on P/Q-, but not N-type channels. Surprisingly, this mutation decreased the (un)binding rates without affecting its overall affinity. The latter mutation suggests that the binding surface on Gbetagamma for N- and P/Q-type channels are different. Also, the manner in which this last mutation affected P/Q-type channels suggests that some residues may be important for \"steering\" or guiding the protein into the binding pocket, whereas others are important for simply binding to the channel.",

        "Title": "Distinctive modulatory effects of five human auxiliary beta2 subunit splice variants on L-type calcium channel gating.",
        "Abstract": "Sequence analysis of the human genome permitted cloning of five Ca(2+)-channel beta(2) splice variants (beta(2a)-beta(2e)) that differed only in their proximal amino-termini. The functional consequences of such beta(2)-subunit diversity were explored in recombinant L-type channels reconstituted in HEK 293 cells. Beta(2a) and beta(2e) targeted autonomously to the plasma membrane, whereas beta(2b)-beta(2d) localized to the cytosol when expressed in HEK 293 cells. The pattern of modulation of L-type channel voltage-dependent inactivation gating correlated with the subcellular localization of the component beta(2) variant-membrane-bound beta(2a) and beta(2e) subunits conferred slow(er) channel inactivation kinetics and displayed a smaller fraction of channels recovering from inactivation with fast kinetics, compared to beta(2b)-beta(2d) channels. The varying effects of beta(2) subunits on inactivation gating were accounted for by a quantitative model in which L-type channels reversibly distributed between fast and slow forms of voltage-dependent inactivation-membrane-bound beta(2) subunits substantially decreased the steady-state fraction of fast inactivating channels. Finally, the beta(2) variants also had distinctive effects on L-type channel steady-state activation gating, as revealed by differences in the waveforms of tail-activation (G-V) curves, and conferred differing degrees of prepulse facilitation to the channel. Our results predict important physiological consequences arising from subtle changes in Ca(2+)-channel beta(2)-subunit structure due to alternative splicing and emphasize the utility of splice variants in probing structure-function mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Engineered calmodulins (CaMs), rendered Ca2+-insensitive by mutations, function as dominant negatives in heterologous systems, and have revealed mechanisms of ion channel modulation by Ca2+/CaM. The use of these CaMs in native mammalian cells now emerges as a strategy to unmask the biology of such Ca2+ feedback. Here, we developed recombinant adenoviruses bearing engineered CaMs to facilitate their expression in adult heart cells, where Ca2+ regulation may be essential for moment-to-moment control of the heartbeat. Engineered CaMs not only eliminated the Ca2+-dependent inactivation of native calcium channels, but exposed an unexpectedly large impact of removing such feedback: the unprecedented (4- to 5-fold) prolongation of action potentials. This striking result recasts the basic paradigm for action-potential control and illustrates the promise of virally delivered engineered CaM to investigate the biology of numerous other CaM-signaling pathways.",

        "Title": "Novel functional properties of Ca(2+) channel beta subunits revealed by their expression in adult rat heart cells.",
        "Abstract": "Recombinant adenoviruses were used to overexpress green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused auxiliary Ca(2+) channel beta subunits (beta(1)-beta(4)) in cultured adult rat heart cells, to explore new dimensions of beta subunit functions in vivo. Distinct beta-GFP subunits distributed differentially between the surface sarcolemma, transverse elements, and nucleus in single heart cells. All beta-GFP subunits increased the native cardiac whole-cell L-type Ca(2+) channel current density, but produced distinctive effects on channel inactivation kinetics. The degree of enhancement of whole-cell current density was non-uniform between beta subunits, with a rank order of potency beta(2a) approximately equal to beta(4) > beta(1b) > beta(3). For each beta subunit, the increase in L-type current density was accompanied by a correlative increase in the maximal gating charge (Q(max)) moved with depolarization. However, beta subunits produced characteristic effects on single L-type channel gating, resulting in divergent effects on channel open probability (P(o)). Quantitative analysis and modelling of single-channel data provided a kinetic signature for each channel type. Spurred on by ambiguities regarding the molecular identity of the actual endogenous cardiac L-type channel beta subunit, we cloned a new rat beta(2) splice variant, beta(2b), from heart using 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR. By contrast with beta(2a), expression of beta(2b) in heart cells yielded channels with a microscopic gating signature virtually identical to that of native unmodified channels. Our results provide novel insights into beta subunit functions that are unattainable in traditional heterologous expression studies, and also provide new perspectives on the molecular identity of the beta subunit component of cardiac L-type Ca(2+) channels. Overall, the work establishes a powerful experimental paradigm to explore novel functions of ion channel subunits in their native environments.",
