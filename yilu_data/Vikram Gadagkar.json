        "Abstract": "Many motor skills are learned by comparing ongoing behavior to internal performance benchmarks. Dopamine neurons encode performance error in behavioral paradigms where error is externally induced, but it remains unknown whether dopamine also signals the quality of natural performance fluctuations. Here, we record dopamine neurons in singing birds and examine how spontaneous dopamine spiking activity correlates with natural fluctuations in ongoing song. Antidromically identified basal ganglia-projecting dopamine neurons correlate with recent, and not future, song variations, consistent with a role in evaluation, not production. Furthermore, maximal dopamine spiking occurs at a single vocal target, consistent with either actively maintaining the existing song or shifting the song to a nearby form. These data show that spontaneous dopamine spiking can evaluate natural behavioral fluctuations unperturbed by experimental events such as cues or rewards.",

        "Abstract": "Movement-related neuronal discharge in ventral tegmental area (VTA) and ventral pallidum (VP) is inconsistently observed across studies. One possibility is that some neurons are movement related and others are not. Another possibility is that the precise behavioral conditions matter-that a single neuron can be movement related under certain behavioral states but not others. We recorded single VTA and VP neurons in birds transitioning between singing and nonsinging states while monitoring body movement with microdrive-mounted accelerometers. Many VP and VTA neurons exhibited body movement-locked activity exclusively when the bird was not singing. During singing, VP and VTA neurons could switch off their tuning to body movement and become instead precisely time-locked to specific song syllables. These changes in neuronal tuning occurred rapidly at state boundaries. Our findings show that movement-related activity in limbic circuits can be gated by behavioral context.",

        "Abstract": "Many behaviors are learned through trial and error by matching performance to internal goals. Yet neural mechanisms of performance evaluation remain poorly understood. We recorded basal ganglia-projecting dopamine neurons in singing zebra finches as we controlled perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback. Dopamine activity was phasically suppressed after distorted syllables, consistent with a worse-than-predicted outcome, and was phasically activated at the precise moment of the song when a predicted distortion did not occur, consistent with a better-than-predicted outcome. Error response magnitude depended on distortion probability. Thus, dopaminergic error signals can evaluate behaviors that are not learned for reward and are instead learned by matching performance outcomes to internal goals.",

We find that the rate of change of the tangential mode frequency with pressure is higher for the sample with traces of polymer compared to the pristine sample. We have performed classical molecular dynamics simulations to study the collapse of single (SWNT) and double-walled carbon nanotube bundles under hydrostatic pressure. The collapse pressure (pc) was found to vary as 1/R3, where R is the SWNT radius or the DWNT effective radius. The bundles showed approximately 30% hysteresis and the hexagonally close packed lattice was completely restored on decompression. The pc of a DWNT bundle was found to be close to the sum of its values for the inner and the outer tubes considered separately as SWNT bundles, demonstrating that the inner tube supports the outer tube and that the effective bending stiffness of DWNT, D(DWNT) - 2D(SWNT).",

        "Title": "Faster development does not lead to correlated evolution of greater pre-adult competitive ability in Drosophila melanogaster.",
        "Abstract": "In comparisons across Drosophila species, faster pre-adult development is phenotypically correlated with increased pre-adult competitive ability, suggesting that these two traits may also be evolutionary correlates of one another. However, correlations between traits within- and among- species can differ, and in most cases it is the within-species genetic correlations that are likely to act as constraints on adaptive evolution. Moreover, laboratory studies on Drosophila melanogaster have shown that the suite of traits that evolves in populations subjected to selection for faster development is the opposite of the traits that evolve in populations selected for increased pre-adult competitive ability. This observation led us to propose that, despite having a higher carrying capacity and a reduced minimum food requirement for completing development than controls, D. melanogaster populations subjected to selection for faster development should have lower competitive ability than controls owing to their reduced larval feeding rates and urea tolerance. Here, we describe results from pre-adult competition experiments that clearly show that the faster developing populations are substantially poorer competitors than controls when reared at high density in competition with a marked mutant strain. We briefly discuss these results in the context of different formulations of density-dependent selection theory.",
