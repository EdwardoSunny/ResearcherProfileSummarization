        "Abstract": "In the prevailing model, Lgr5+ cells are the only intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that sustain homeostatic epithelial regeneration by upward migration of progeny through elusive upper crypt transit-amplifying (TA) intermediates. Here, we identify a proliferative upper crypt population marked by Fgfbp1, in the location of putative TA cells, that is transcriptionally distinct from Lgr5+ cells.

It is a unique and complex immune disorder to study as the driving antigen is known and the tissue targeted by the immune reaction can be interrogated.

        "Abstract": "Production of amphiregulin (Areg) by regulatory T (Treg) cells promotes repair after acute tissue injury. Here, we examined the function of Treg cells in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a setting of chronic liver injury. Areg-producing Treg cells were enriched in the livers of mice and humans with NASH. Deletion of Areg in Treg cells, but not in myeloid cells, reduced NASH-induced liver fibrosis. Chronic liver damage induced transcriptional changes associated with Treg cell activation. Mechanistically, Treg cell-derived Areg activated pro-fibrotic transcriptional programs in hepatic stellate cells via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Deletion of Areg in Treg cells protected mice from NASH-dependent glucose intolerance, which also was dependent on EGFR signaling on hepatic stellate cells. Areg from Treg cells promoted hepatocyte gluconeogenesis through hepatocyte detection of hepatic stellate cell-derived interleukin-6. Our findings reveal a maladaptive role for Treg cell-mediated tissue repair functions in chronic liver disease and link liver damage to NASH-dependent glucose intolerance.",

Here we identified CD1a-dependent T cell responses to phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a ubiquitous bacterial membrane phospholipid, as well as to lysylPG, a modified PG, present in several Gram-positive bacteria and highly abundant in Staphylococcus aureus. The crystal structure of the CD1a-PG complex showed that the acyl chains were buried within the A'- and F'-pockets of CD1a, while the phosphoglycerol headgroup remained solvent exposed in the F'-portal and was available for T cell receptor contact. Using lysylPG and PG-loaded CD1a tetramers, we identified T cells in peripheral blood and in skin that respond to these lipids in a dose-dependent manner. Tetramer",

Using human CRC samples and murine CRC models, we found that most \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in premalignant or nontumor colons exhibit cytotoxic markers, whereas tumor-infiltrating \u03b3\u03b4 T cells express a protumorigenic profile. These contrasting T cell profiles were associated with distinct T cell receptor (TCR)-V\u03b3\u03b4 gene usage in both humans and mice. Longitudinal intersectional genetics and antibody-dependent strategies targeting murine \u03b3\u03b4 T cells enriched in the epithelium at steady state led to heightened tumor development, whereas targeting \u03b3\u03b4 subsets that accumulate during CRC resulted in reduced tumor growth. Our results uncover temporal pro- and antitumor roles for \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) correlate with T cell infiltrates, but the specific contributions of heterogenous T cell types remain unclear. To investigate the diverse function of T cells in CRC, we profiled 37,931 T cells from tumors and adjacent normal colon of 16 patients with CRC with respect to transcriptome, TCR sequence, and cell surface markers. Our analysis identified phenotypically and functionally distinguishable effector T cell types. We employed single-cell gene signatures from these T cell subsets to query the TCGA database to assess their prognostic significance. We found 2 distinct cytotoxic T cell types. GZMK+KLRG1+ cytotoxic T cells were enriched in CRC patients with good outcomes. GNLY+CD103+ cytotoxic T cells with a dysfunctional phenotype were not associated with good outcomes, despite coexpression of CD39 and CD103, markers that denote tumor reactivity. We found 2 distinct Treg subtypes associated with opposite outcomes. While total Tregs were associated with good outcomes, CD38+ Tregs were associated with bad outcomes independently of stage and possessed a highly suppressive phenotype, suggesting that they inhibit antitumor immunity in CRC. These findings highlight the potential utility of these subpopulations in predicting outcomes and support the potential for novel therapies directed at CD38+ Tregs or CD8+CD103+ T cells.",

        "Abstract": "T cells are implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), yet their clonality, specificity, and function are incompletely defined. Here we used T cell receptor \u03b2 chain (TCRB) sequencing to study the T cell repertoire in the coronary artery, endomyocardium, and peripheral blood at the time of retransplant in four cases of CAV and compared it to the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) repertoire from the same samples. High-dimensional flow cytometry coupled with single-cell PCR was also used to define the T cell phenotype. Extensive overlap was observed between intragraft and blood TCRBs in all cases, a finding supported by robust quantitative diversity metrics. In contrast, blood and graft IGHV repertoires from the same samples showed minimal overlap. Coronary infiltrates included CD4",

The idea of cancer immunosurveillance was first conceived over a century ago but remained controversial through much of the 20th century. In the past few decades, however, the field has progressed rapidly, and the concept of tumor immunosurveillance is now well established. With this chapter, we provide a historical background of immunosurveillance, the concept of immunoediting, and the role of different T-cell subsets in the tumor microenvironment. We also discuss the relationship between immune checkpoints, tumor antigens, T cell receptor repertoire, and immunosurveillance. Finally, we comment on the future of immunotherapy as it relates to T cell immunosurveillance.",

RNA sequencing revealed that human and murine iPSCs express tumor-associated antigens, and we show here a proof of principle for using irradiated iPSCs in autologous anti-tumor vaccines. In a prophylactic setting, iPSC vaccines prevent tumor growth in syngeneic murine breast cancer, mesothelioma, and melanoma models. As an adjuvant, the iPSC vaccine inhibited melanoma recurrence at the resection site and reduced metastatic tumor load, which was associated with fewer Th17 cells and increased CD11b",

        "Abstract": "Multiple myeloma is characterized by the clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. But the phenotypic diversity and the contribution of less predominant B-lineage clones to the biology of this disease have been controversial. Here, we asked whether cells bearing the dominant multiple myeloma immunoglobulin rearrangement occupy phenotypic compartments other than that of plasma cells. To accomplish this, we combined 13-parameter FACS index sorting and t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualization with high-throughput single-cell immunoglobulin sequencing to track selected B-lineage clones across different stages of human B-cell development. As expected, the predominant clones preferentially mapped to aberrant plasma cell compartments, albeit phenotypically altered from wild type. Interestingly, up to 1.2% of cells of the predominant clones colocalized with B-lineage cells of a normal phenotype. In addition, minor clones with distinct immunoglobulin sequences were detected in up to 9% of sequenced cells, but only 2 out of 12 of these clones showed aberrant immune phenotypes. The majority of these minor clones showed intraclonal silent nucleotide differences within the CDR3s and varying frequencies of somatic mutations in the immunoglobulin genes. Therefore, the phenotypic range of multiple myeloma cells in the bone marrow is not confined to aberrant-phenotype plasma cells but extends to low frequencies of normal-phenotype B cells, in line with the recently reported success of B cell-targeting cellular therapies in some patients. The majority of minor clones result from parallel nonmalignant expansion. ",

        "Abstract": "T cell receptor (TCR) sequences are very diverse, with many more possible sequence combinations than T cells in any one individual. Here we define the minimal requirements for TCR antigen specificity, through an analysis of TCR sequences using a panel of peptide and major histocompatibility complex (pMHC)-tetramer-sorted cells and structural data. From this analysis we developed an algorithm that we term GLIPH (grouping of lymphocyte interactions by paratope hotspots) to cluster TCRs with a high probability of sharing specificity owing to both conserved motifs and global similarity of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. We show that GLIPH can reliably group TCRs of common specificity from different donors, and that conserved CDR3 motifs help to define the TCR clusters that are often contact points with the antigenic peptides. As an independent validation, we analysed 5,711 TCR\u03b2 chain sequences from reactive CD4 T cells from 22 individuals with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We found 141 TCR specificity groups, including 16 distinct groups containing TCRs from multiple individuals. These TCR groups typically shared HLA alleles, allowing prediction of the likely HLA restriction, and a large number of M. tuberculosis T cell epitopes enabled us to identify pMHC ligands for all five of the groups tested. Mutagenesis and de novo TCR design confirmed that the GLIPH-identified motifs were critical and sufficient for shared-antigen recognition. Thus the GLIPH algorithm can analyse large numbers of TCR sequences and define TCR specificity groups shared by TCRs and individuals, which should greatly accelerate the analysis of T cell responses and expedite the identification of specific ligands.",

Palmitoylated Wnt ligands engage cell-surface frizzled (FZD) receptors and LRP5 and LRP6 co-receptors, enabling \u03b2-catenin nuclear translocation and TCF/LEF-dependent gene transactivation. Mutations in Wnt downstream signalling components have revealed diverse functions thought to be carried out by Wnt ligands themselves. However, redundancy between the 19 mammalian Wnt proteins and 10 FZD receptors and Wnt hydrophobicity have made it difficult to attribute these functions directly to Wnt ligands. For example, individual mutations in Wnt ligands have not revealed homeostatic phenotypes in the intestinal epithelium-an archetypal canonical, Wnt pathway-dependent, rapidly self-renewing tissue, the regeneration of which is fueled by proliferative crypt Lgr5",

        "Abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-17 plays a key role in immunity. In acute infections, a rapid IL-17 response must be induced without prior antigen exposure, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are the major initial IL-17 producers. In fact, some \u03b3\u03b4 T cells make IL-17 within hours after an immune challenge. These cells appear to acquire the ability to respond to IL-1 and IL-23 and to make IL-17 naturally in na\u00efve animals. They are known as the natural T\u03b3\u03b417 (nT\u03b3\u03b417) cells. The rapidity of the nT\u03b3\u03b417 response, and the apparent lack of explicit T cell receptor (TCR) engagement for its induction have led to the view that this is a cytokine (IL-1, IL-23)-mediated response. However, pharmacological inhibition or genetic defects in TCR signaling drastically reduce the nT\u03b3\u03b417 response and/or their presence. To better understand antigen recognition in this rapid IL-17 response, we analyzed the antigen receptor repertoire of IL-1R(+)/IL-23R(+) \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, a proxy for nT\u03b3\u03b417 cells in na\u00efve animals directly ex vivo, using a barcode-enabled high throughput single-cell TCR sequence analysis. We found that regardless of their anatomical origin, these cells have a highly focused TCR repertoire. In particular, the TCR sequences have limited V gene combinations, little or no junctional diversity and much reduced or no N region diversity. In contrast, IL-23R(-) cells at mucosal sites similar to most of the splenic \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and small intestine epithelial \u03b3\u03b4 lymphocytes expressed diverse TCRs. This remarkable commonality and restricted repertoire of IL-1R(+)/IL-23R(+) \u03b3\u03b4 T cells underscores the importance of antigen recognition in their establishment/function.",

        "Abstract": "Although each T lymphocyte expresses a T-cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes cognate antigen and controls T-cell activation, different T cells bearing the same TCR can be functionally distinct. Each TCR is a heterodimer, and both \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains contribute to determining TCR antigen specificity. Here we present a methodology enabling integration of information about TCR specificity with information about T cell function. This method involves sequencing of TCR\u03b1 and TCR\u03b2 genes, and amplifying functional genes characteristic of different T cell subsets, in single T cells. Because this approach retains information about individual TCR\u03b1-TCR\u03b2 pairs, TCRs of interest can be expressed and used in functional studies, for antigen discovery, or in therapeutic applications. We apply this approach to study the clonal ancestry and differentiation of T lymphocytes infiltrating a human colorectal carcinoma.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in technology and data analysis have made it possible to take a new look at human immunology. These advances run the gamut from systems biology approaches, which are likely in the vanguard of how we can start \"to put the pieces together\" of immune function, to a deeper understanding of specific diseases and vaccines and the immune repertoire. In our own experience, we have also found that asking simple questions about human immunity has often given us very surprising answers, causing a rethink of established dogma. Thus, we have developed a new perspective on the nature of the \u03b1\u03b2 TCR repertoire and also the likely role of T-cell repertoire (TCR) cross-reactivity in generating T memory independent of specific antigen interactions. These findings show that human immunology is not just a necessary step for \"translating\" basic immunology to treat diseases or develop better vaccines, but is also an important complement to the inbred mouse model.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease is an intestinal autoimmune disease driven by dietary gluten and gluten-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses. In celiac patients on a gluten-free diet, exposure to gluten induces the appearance of gluten-specific CD4(+) T cells with gut-homing potential in the peripheral blood. Here we show that gluten exposure also induces the appearance of activated, gut-homing CD8(+) \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the peripheral blood. Single-cell T-cell receptor sequence analysis indicates that both of these cell populations have highly focused T-cell receptor repertoires, indicating that their induction is antigen-driven. These results reveal a previously unappreciated role of antigen in the induction of CD8(+) \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in celiac disease and demonstrate a coordinated response by all three of the major types of T cells. More broadly, these responses may parallel adaptive immune responses to viral pathogens and other systemic autoimmune diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Although T\u00a0cell memory is generally thought to require direct antigen exposure, we found an abundance of memory-phenotype cells (20%-90%, averaging over 50%) of CD4(+) T\u00a0cells specific to viral antigens in adults who had never been infected. These cells express the appropriate memory markers and genes, rapidly produce cytokines, and have clonally expanded. In contrast, the same T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR) specificities in newborns are almost entirely na\u00efve, which might explain the vulnerability of young children to infections. One mechanism for\u00a0this phenomenon is TCR cross-reactivity to environmental antigens, and in support of this, we found extensive cross-recognition by HIV-1 and influenza-reactive T lymphocytes to other microbial peptides and expansion of one of these after influenza vaccination. Thus, the presence of these memory-phenotype T\u00a0cells has significant implications for immunity to novel pathogens, child and adult health, and the\u00a0influence of pathogen-rich versus hygienic environments.",

        "Title": "Structure and conserved RNA binding of the PAZ domain.",
        "Abstract": "The discovery of RNA-mediated gene-silencing pathways, including RNA interference, highlights a fundamental role of short RNAs in eukaryotic gene regulation and antiviral defence. Members of the Dicer and Argonaute protein families are essential components of these RNA-silencing pathways. Notably, these two families possess an evolutionarily conserved PAZ (Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille) domain whose biochemical function is unknown. Here we report the nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of the PAZ domain from Drosophila melanogaster Argonaute 1 (Ago1). The structure consists of a left-handed, six-stranded beta-barrel capped at one end by two alpha-helices and wrapped on one side by a distinctive appendage, which comprises a long beta-hairpin and a short alpha-helix. Using structural and biochemical analyses, we demonstrate that the PAZ domain binds a 5-nucleotide RNA with 1:1 stoichiometry. We map the RNA-binding surface to the open face of the beta-barrel, which contains amino acids conserved within the PAZ domain family, and we define the 5'-to-3' orientation of single-stranded RNA bound within that site. Furthermore, we show that PAZ domains from different human Argonaute proteins also bind RNA, establishing a conserved function for this domain.",

        "Abstract": "Bam32 is an adaptor protein recruited to the plasma membrane upon B cell receptor (BCR) crosslinking in a phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner; however, its physiologic function is unclear. To determine its physiologic function, we produced Bam32-deficient mice. Bam32(-/-) B cells develop normally but have impaired T-independent antibody responses in vivo and diminished responses to BCR crosslinking in vitro. Biochemical analysis revealed that Bam32 acts in a novel pathway leading from the BCR to MAPK/ERK Kinases (MEK1/2), MAPK/ERK Kinase Kinase-1 (MEKK1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38). This pathway appears to be initiated by hematopoietic progenitor kinase-1 (HPK1), which interacts directly with Bam32, and differs from all previously characterized BCR signaling pathways in that it is required for normal BCR-mediated proliferation but not for B cell survival.",
