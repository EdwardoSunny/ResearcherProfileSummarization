We conducted a focus group interview for needs assessment. We designed a scoring algorithm to provide customized recommendation of surgical modalities based on a patient's medical history and personal preferences. We completed a prototype implementation of the tool. Initial data from a validation study indicated that the system achieved 99.18% accuracy in its recommendation. A study to examine the usefulness and usability of EyeChoose is ongoing. Future research is required to implement the tool in naturalistic settings and to examine the generalizability of the findings to other populations.",

        "Abstract": "High rates of depression and suicide and a lack of trained psychiatrists have emerged as significant concerns in the low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as the Pacific Island Countries (PICs). Readily available smartphones were leveraged with community health nurses (CHNs) in task-sharing for early identification of suicide and depression risks in Fiji Islands, the largest of PICs. This investigation examines how CHNs can efficiently and effectively process patient information about depression and suicide risk for making diagnostic and management decisions without compromising safety. The research is driven by the theoretical framework of text comprehension (knowledge representation and interpretation) and decision-making.",

        "Abstract": "A byproduct of the transition to electronic health records (EHRs) is the associated observational data that capture EHR users' granular interactions with the medical record. Often referred to as audit log data or event log data, these datasets capture and timestamp user activity while they are logged in to the EHR. These data - alone and in combination with other datasets - offer a new source of insights, which cannot be gleaned from claims data or clinical data, to support health services research and those studying healthcare processes and outcomes. In this commentary, we seek to promote broader awareness of EHR audit log data and to stimulate their use in many contexts. We do so by describing EHR audit log data and offering a framework for their potential uses in quality domains (as defined by the National Academy of Medicine). The framework is illustrated with select examples in the safety and efficiency domains, along with their accompanying methodologies, which serve as a proof of concept. This article also discusses insights and challenges from working with EHR audit log data. Ensuring that researchers are aware of such data, and the new opportunities they offer, is one way to assure that our healthcare system benefits from the digital revolution.",

        "Abstract": "Vast volumes of data, coded through hierarchical terminologies (e.g., International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision-Clinical Modification [ICD10-CM], Medical Subject Headings [MeSH]), are generated routinely in electronic health record systems and medical literature databases. Although graphic representations can help to augment human understanding of such data sets, a graph with hundreds or thousands of nodes challenges human comprehension. To improve comprehension, new tools are needed to extract the overviews of such data sets. We aim to develop a visual interactive analytic tool for filtering and summarizing large health data sets coded with hierarchical terminologies (VIADS) as an online, and publicly accessible tool. The ultimate goals are to filter, summarize the health data sets, extract insights, compare and highlight the differences between various health data sets by using VIADS. The results generated from VIADS can be utilized as data-driven evidence to facilitate clinicians, clinical researchers, and health care administrators to make more informed clinical, research, and administrative decisions. We utilized the following tools and the development environments to develop VIADS: Django, Python, JavaScript, Vis.js, Graph.js, JQuery, Plotly, Chart.js, Unittest, R, and MySQL.",

        "Title": "Overlaying multiple sources of data to identify bottlenecks in clinical workflow.",
        "Abstract": "The pursuit of increased efficiency and quality of clinical care based on the analysis of workflow has seen the introduction of several modern technologies into medical environments. Electronic health records (EHRs) remain central to analysis of workflow, owing to their wide-ranging impact on clinical processes. The two most common interventions to facilitate EHR-related workflow analysis are automated location tracking using sensor-based technologies and EHR usage data logs. However, to maximize the potential of these technologies, and especially to facilitate workflow redesign, it is necessary to overlay these quantitative findings on the contextual data from qualitative methods such as ethnography. Such a complementary approach promises to yield more precise measures of clinical workflow that provide insights into how redesign could address inefficiencies. In this paper, we categorize clinical workflow in the Emergency Department (ED) into three types (perceived, real and ideal) to create a structured approach to workflow redesign using the available data. We use diverse data sources: sensor-based location tracking through Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), summary EHR usage data logs, and data from physician interviews augmented by direct observations (through clinician shadowing). Our goal is to discover inefficiencies and bottlenecks that can be addressed to achieve a more ideal workflow state relative to its real and perceived state. We thereby seek to demonstrate a novel data-driven approach toward iterative workflow redesign that generalizes for use in a variety of settings. We also propose types of targeted support or adjustments to offset some of the inefficiencies we noted.",

        "Abstract": "The analysis of clinical workflow offers many challenges, especially in settings characterized by rapid dynamic change. Typically, some combination of approaches drawn from ethnography and grounded theory-based qualitative methods are used to develop relevant metrics. Medical institutions have recently attempted to introduce technological interventions to develop quantifiable quality metrics to supplement existing purely qualitative analyses. These interventions range from automated location tracking to repositories of clinical data (e.g., electronics health record (EHR) data, medical equipment logs). Our goal in this paper is to present a cohesive framework that combines a set of analytic techniques that can potentially complement traditional human observations to derive a deeper understanding of clinical workflow and thereby to enhance the quality, safety, and efficiency of care offered in that environment. We present a series of theoretically-guided techniques to perform analysis and visualization of data developed using location tracking, with illustrations using the Emergency Department (ED) as an example. Our framework is divided into three modules: (i) transformation, (ii) analysis, and (iii) visualization. We describe the methods used in each of these modules, and provide a series of visualizations developed using location-tracking data collected at the Mayo Clinic ED (Phoenix, AZ). Our innovative analytics go beyond qualitative study, and includes user data collected from a relatively modern but increasingly ubiquitous technique of location tracking, with the goal of creating quantitative workflow metrics. Although we believe that the methods we have developed will generalize well to other settings, additional work will be required to demonstrate their broad utility beyond our single study environment.",

These problems are especially evident in critical care, where monitoring of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol provides an excellent opportunity to study the efficacy of applications that allow for the rapid capture of event information, providing theoretically-driven feedback using the data. Our goal was, (a) to design and implement a way to capture data on deviation from the standard practice based on the theoretical foundation of error classification from our past research, (b) to provide a means to meaningfully visualize the collected data, and (c) to provide a proof-of-concept for this implementation, using some understanding of user experience in clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "Hospital Emergency Departments (EDs) frequently experience crowding. One of the factors that contributes to this crowding is the \"door to doctor time\", which is the time from a patient's registration to when the patient is first seen by a physician. This is also one of the Meaningful Use (MU) performance measures that emergency departments report to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Current documentation methods for this measure are inaccurate due to the imprecision in manual data collection. We describe a method for automatically (in real time) and more accurately documenting the door to physician time. Using sensor-based technology, the distance between the physician and the computer is calculated by using the single board computers installed in patient rooms that log each time a Bluetooth signal is seen from a device that the physicians carry. This distance is compared automatically with the accepted room radius to determine if the physicians are present in the room at the time logged to provide greater precision. The logged times, accurate to the second, were compared with physicians' handwritten times, showing automatic recordings to be more precise. This real time automatic method will free the physician from extra cognitive load of manually recording data. This method for evaluation of performance is generic and can be used in any other setting outside the ED, and for purposes other than measuring physician time.",

        "Abstract": "We propose a methodological framework for evaluating clinical cognitive activities in complex real-world environments that provides a guiding framework for characterizing the patterns of activities. This approach, which we refer to as a process-based approach, is particularly relevant to cognitive informatics (CI) research-an interdisciplinary domain utilizing cognitive approaches in the study of computing systems and applications-as it provides new ways for understanding human information processing, interactions, and behaviors. Using this approach involves the identification of a process of interest (e.g., a clinical workflow), and the contributing sequences of activities in that process (e.g., medication ordering). A variety of analytical approaches can then be used to characterize the inherent dependencies and relations within the contributing activities within the considered process. Using examples drawn from our own research and the extant research literature, we describe the theoretical foundations of the process-based approach, relevant practical and pragmatic considerations for using such an approach, and a generic framework for applying this approach for evaluation studies in clinical settings. We also discuss the potential for this approach in future evaluations of interactive clinical systems, given the need for new approaches for evaluation, and significant opportunities for automated, unobtrusive data collection.",

        "Abstract": "A fundamental challenge in the field of clinical decision support is to determine what characteristics of systems make them effective in supporting particular types of clinical decisions. However, we lack such a theory of decision support itself and a model to describe clinical decisions and the systems to support them. This article outlines such a framework. We present a two-stream model of information flow within clinical decision-support systems (CDSSs): reasoning about the patient (the clinical stream), and reasoning about the user (the cognitive-behavioral stream). We propose that CDSS \"effectiveness\" be measured not only in terms of a system's impact on clinical care, but also in terms of how (and by whom) the system is used, its effect on work processes, and whether it facilitates appropriate decisions by clinicians and patients. Future research into which factors improve the effectiveness of decision support should not regard CDSSs as a single entity, but should instead differentiate systems based on their attributes, users, and the decision being supported.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes a distributed collaborative effort between industry and academia to systematize data management in an academic biomedical laboratory. Heterogeneous and voluminous nature of research data created in biomedical laboratories make information management difficult and research unproductive. One such collaborative effort was evaluated over a period of four years using data collection methods including ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, web-based surveys, progress reports, conference call summaries, and face-to-face group discussions. Data were analyzed using qualitative methods of data analysis to (1) characterize specific problems faced by biomedical researchers with traditional information management practices, (2) identify intervention areas to introduce a new research information management system called Labmatrix, and finally to (3) evaluate and delineate important general collaboration (intervention) characteristics that can optimize outcomes of an implementation process in biomedical laboratories. Results emphasize the importance of end user perseverance, human-centric interoperability evaluation, and demonstration of return on investment of effort and time of laboratory members and industry personnel for success of implementation process. In addition, there is an intrinsic learning component associated with the implementation process of an information management system. Technology transfer experience in a complex environment such as the biomedical laboratory can be eased with use of information systems that support human and cognitive interoperability. Such informatics features can also contribute to successful collaboration and hopefully to scientific productivity.",

        "Abstract": "Effective communication during nurse handoffs is instrumental in ensuring safe and quality patient care. Much of the prior research on nurse handoffs has utilized retrospective methods such as interviews, surveys and questionnaires. While extremely useful, an in-depth understanding of the structure and content of conversations, and the inherent relationships within the content is paramount to designing effective nurse handoff interventions. In this paper, we present a methodological framework-Sequential Conversational Analysis (SCA)-a mixed-method approach that integrates qualitative conversational analysis with quantitative sequential pattern analysis. We describe the SCA approach and provide a detailed example as a proof of concept of its use for the analysis of nurse handoff communication in a medical intensive care unit. This novel approach allows us to characterize the conversational structure, clinical content, disruptions in the conversation, and the inherently phasic nature of nurse handoff communication. The characterization of communication patterns highlights the relationships underlying the verbal content of nurse handoffs with specific emphasis on: the interactive nature of conversation, relevance of role-based (incoming, outgoing) communication requirements, clinical content focus on critical patient-related events, and discussion of pending patient management tasks. We also discuss the applicability of the SCA approach as a method for providing in-depth understanding of the dynamics of communication in other settings and domains.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in the medical field have increased the need to incorporate modern techniques into surgical resident training and surgical skills learning. To facilitate this integration, one approach that has gained credibility is the incorporation of simulator based training to supplement traditional training programs. However, existing implementations of these training methods still require the constant presence of a competent surgeon to assess the surgical dexterity of the trainee, which limits the evaluation methods and relies on subjective evaluation. This research proposes an efficient, effective, and economic video-based skill assessment technique for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). It analyzes a surgeon's hand and surgical tool movements and detects features like smoothness, efficiency, and preciseness. The system is capable of providing both real time on-screen feedback and a performance score at the end of the surgery. Finally, we present a web-based tool where surgeons can securely upload MIS training videos and receive evaluation scores and an analysis of trainees' performance trends over time.",

We further show how departures from clinical protocols or guidelines can yield innovative and appropriate solutions to unusual problems. This review addresses cognitive approaches to the study of human error and its recovery process, highlighting their implications in promoting patient safety and quality. In addition, we discuss methods for enhancing error recognition, and promoting suitable responses, through external cognitive support and virtual reality simulations for the training of clinicians.",

Our objective was to describe the relationship between clinical complexity, diagnostic uncertainty, fit with illness script and the content of case presentations by physicians. We observed the handoff of care for150 patients during eleven shift changes at a large urban emergency department (ED). Results indicate that as uncertainty about diagnosis and perceived illness script increased, more descriptive detail was conveyed to the incoming physicians. Physicians were concerned primarily with creating a shared mental model of a patient's clinical state and with describing the expected path to disposition rather than simply passing on data and findings. Electronic tools for ED handoffs should allow adjustment of structure and content to capture complexity and uncertainty appropriately without requiring extra effort for more routine cases that better fit to more standard narratives.",

Based on a review of articles published in the Journal of Biomedical Informatics (JBI) between January 2001 and March 2014, we identified 57 articles that focused on topics related to cognitive informatics. We found that while the acceptance of CI into the mainstream informatics research literature is relatively recent, its impact has been significant - from characterizing the limits of clinician problem-solving and reasoning behavior, to describing coordination and communication patterns of distributed clinical teams, to developing sustainable and cognitively-plausible interventions for supporting clinician activities. Additionally, we found that most research contributions fell under the topics of decision-making, usability and distributed team activities with a focus on studying behavioral and cognitive aspects of clinical personnel, as they performed their activities or interacted with health information systems. We summarize our findings within the context of the current areas of CI research, future research directions and current and future challenges for CI researchers.",

The ability to organize information in ways that facilitate the generation of effective diagnostic solutions is a distinguishing characteristic of expert physicians, suggesting that automated systems that organize clinical information in a similar manner may augment physicians' decision-making capabilities. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of a theoretically driven cognitive support system (CSS) that assists psychiatrists in their interpretation of clinical cases.

        "Abstract": "Experts are believed to make fewer errors than novices. Researchers in other domains have shown that experts not only make less errors, they also detect and recover from these errors better than non-experts. To investigate this phenomenon among dialysis technicians working in hemodialysis, we evaluated the ability of dialysis technicians to detect and recover from healthcare errors. Two clinical cases with embedded errors were created by an expert nephrology nurse. Twenty-four dialysis technician subjects read the cases aloud and then answered a set of related questions. Subjects' error detection and recovery responses were scored against the clinical cases. We found that there was no significant difference between the ability of expert and non-expert dialysis technicians to detect errors. However, expert dialysis technicians recovered from significantly more healthcare errors than less experienced non-expert dialysis technicians. This has implications for training dialysis technicians in better error detection and recovery strategies.",

However, understanding of the BQM process is limited in the literature. To bridge this gap, we performed the initial steps of a cognitive task analysis using 31 BQM instances conducted between one analyst and 22 researchers in one academic department. We identified five top-level tasks, i.e., clarify research statement, explain clinical process, identify related data elements, locate EHR data element, and end BQM with either a database query or unmet, infeasible information needs, and 10 sub-tasks. We evaluated the BQM task model with seven data analysts from different clinical research institutions. Evaluators found all the tasks completely or semi-valid. This study contributes initial knowledge towards the development of a generalizable cognitive task representation for BQM.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical Systems have become standard partners with clinicians in the care of patients. As these systems become integral parts of the clinical workflow, they have the potential to help improve patient outcomes, however they have also in some cases have led to adverse events and has resulted in patients coming to harm. Often the root cause analysis of these adverse events can be traced back to Usability Errors in the Health Information Technology (HIT) or its interaction with users. Interoperability of the documentation of HIT related Usability Errors in a consistent fashion can improve our ability to do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. In an effort to support improved and more interoperable data capture regarding Usability Errors, we have created the Usability Error Ontology (UEO) as a classification method for representing knowledge regarding Usability Errors. We expect the UEO will grow over time to support an increasing number of HIT system types. In this manuscript, we present this Ontology of Usability Error Types and specifically address Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE), Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Revenue Cycle HIT systems.",

        "Abstract": "Critical care environments are complex and dynamic. To adapt to such environments, clinicians may be required to make alterations to their workflows resulting in deviations from standard procedures. In this work, deviations from standards in trauma critical care are studied. Thirty trauma cases were observed in a Level 1 trauma center. Activities tracked were compared to the Advance Trauma Life Support standard to determine (i) if deviations had occurred, (ii) type of deviations and (iii) whether deviations were initiated by individuals or collaboratively by the team. Results show that expert clinicians deviated to innovate, while deviations of novices result mostly in error. Experts' well developed knowledge allows for flexibility and adaptiveness in dealing with standards, resulting in innovative deviations while minimizing errors made. Providing informatics solution, in such a setting, would mean that standard protocols would have be flexible enough to \"learn\" from new knowledge, yet provide strong support for the trainees.",

        "Abstract": "Successful handoffs ensure smooth, efficient and safe patient care transitions. Tools and systems designed for standardization of clinician handoffs often focuses on ensuring the communication activity during transitions, with limited support for preparatory activities such as information seeking and organization. We designed and evaluated a Handoff Intervention Tool (HAND-IT) based on a checklist-inspired, body system format allowing structured information organization, and a problem-case narrative format allowing temporal description of patient care events. Based on a pre-post prospective study using a multi-method analysis we evaluated the effectiveness of HAND-IT as a documentation tool. We found that the use of HAND-IT led to fewer transition breakdowns, greater tool resilience, and likely led to better learning outcomes for less-experienced clinicians when compared to the current tool. We discuss the implications of our results for improving patient safety with a continuity of care-based approach.",

In this paper, we propose and use an evaluation method, using digitally simulated patients (avatars) to evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning of PCPs and compared it to the traditional use of paper-based cases. Verbal (think-aloud) protocols were captured in the context of a diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning task. Propositional and semantic representational analysis of simulation data during evaluation, showed specific deficiencies in PCP reasoning, suggesting a promise of this technology in training and evaluation in mental health. Avatars are flexible and easily modifiable and are also a cost-effective and easy-to-disseminate educational tool.",

        "Abstract": "High-content screening (HCS) technology provides a powerful vantage point to approach biological problems; it allows analysis of cell parameters, including changes in cell or protein movement, shape, or texture. As part of a collaborative pilot research project to improve bioscience research data integration, we identified HCS data management as an area ripe for advancement. A primary goal was to develop an integrated data management and analysis system suitable for small- to medium-size HCS programs that would improve research productivity and increase work satisfaction. A system was developed that uses Labmatrix, a Web-based research data management platform, to integrate and query data derived from a Cellomics STORE database. Focusing on user expectations, several barriers to HCS productivity were identified and reduced or eliminated. The impact of the project on HCS research productivity was tested through a series of 18 lab-requested integrated data queries, 7 of which were fully enabled, 7 partially enabled, and 4 enabled through data export to standalone data analysis tools. The results are limited to one laboratory, but this pilot suggests that through an \"implementation research\" approach, a network of small- to medium-size laboratories involved in HCS projects could achieve greater productivity and satisfaction in drug discovery research.",

        "Abstract": "The pervasiveness of reasoning errors in emergency care (EC) is commonly acknowledged in clinical research. Much of this work has focused on diagnostic errors; yet, in EC, providing a specific diagnosis is generally secondary to managing the patient. To gain insights into non-diagnostic, treatment-related errors, we presented EC residents with computer-based case simulations and recorded their actions and verbalized thoughts. Nearly all participants diagnosed both study cases correctly yet made a variety of patient management errors, some with serious consequences. More substantial errors could be classified as stemming from incorrect patient status and treatment inferences. These EC reasoning errors are discussed within the framework of underlying cognitive processes.",

This paper documents the use of Opensimulator, a virtual world development platform, to create a virtual Intensive Care Unit where error recovery can be studied in a controlled, yet realistic environment. Subjects participated in rounds presented by computer-generated characters. Errors were embedded in these presentations, and subjects were evaluated for their ability to detect them. Eight subjects were asked to evaluate two cases and answer related knowledge-based questions under two conditions: primed (forewarned of the presence of errors) and un-primed. Subjects frequently failed to detect errors despite having the prerequisite knowledge. Priming significantly improved detection, suggesting a role for interventions that aim to shift clinicians' error detection toward the limits of their knowledge. Such interventions may provide means to decrease adverse events resulting from human error.",

        "Abstract": "Handoffs have been recognized as a major healthcare challenge primarily due to the breakdowns in communication that occur during transitions in care. Consequently, they are characterized as being \"remarkably haphazard\". To investigate the information breakdowns in group handoff communication, we conducted a study at a large academic hospital in Texas. We used multifaceted qualitative methods such as observations, shadowing of care providers and their work activities, audio-recording of handoffs, and care provider interviews to examine the handoff communication workflow, with particular emphasis on investigating the sources of information breakdowns. Using a mixed inductive-deductive analysis approach, we identified two critical sources for information breakdowns - lack of standardization in handoff communication events and unsuccessful completion of pre-turnover coordination activities. We propose strategic solutions that can effectively help mitigate the handoff communication breakdowns.",

        "Title": "Bridging gaps in handoffs: a continuity of care based approach.",
        "Abstract": "Handoff among healthcare providers has been recognized as a major source of medical errors. Most prior research has often focused on the communication aspects of handoff, with limited emphasis on the overall handoff process, especially from a clinician workflow perspective. Such a workflow perspective that is based on the continuity of care model provides a framework required to identify and support an interconnected trajectory of care events affecting handoff communication. To this end, we propose a new methodology, referred to as the clinician-centered approach that allows us to investigate and represent the entire clinician workflow prior to, during and, after handoff communication. This representation of clinician activities supports a comprehensive analysis of the interdependencies in the handoff process across the care continuum, as opposed to a single discrete, information sharing activity. The clinician-centered approach is supported by multifaceted methods for data collection such as observations, shadowing of clinicians, audio recording of handoff communication, semi-structured interviews and artifact identification and collection. The analysis followed a two-stage mixed inductive-deductive method. The iterative development of clinician-centered approach was realized using a multi-faceted study conducted in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) of an academic hospital. Using the clinician-centered approach, we (a) identify the nature, inherent characteristics and the interdependencies between three phases of the handoff process and (b) develop a descriptive framework of handoff communication in critical care that captures the non-linear, recursive and interactive nature of collaboration and decision-making. The results reported in this paper serve as a \"proof of concept\" of our approach, emphasizing the importance of capturing a coordinated and uninterrupted succession of clinician information management and transfer activities in relation to patient care events.",

        "Abstract": "A recent trend in the literature has been to characterize healthcare activities in terms of complex systems theory. Complexity has often been loosely and variously defined, with meanings ranging from \"not simple\" to \"complicated\" to \"intractable.\" In this paper, we consider various aspects of complexity and how they relate to modern healthcare practice, with the aim of developing research approaches for studying complex healthcare environments. We propose a theoretical lens for understanding and studying complexity in healthcare systems based on degrees of interrelatedness of system components. We also describe, with relevant caveats, how complex healthcare systems are generally decomposable, rendering them more tractable for further study. The ideas of interrelatedness among the components of a system as a measure of complexity and functional decomposition as a mechanism for studying meaningful subcomponents of a complex system can be used as a framework for understanding complex healthcare systems. Using examples drawn from current literature and our own research, we explain the feasibility of this approach for understanding, studying, and managing complex healthcare systems.",

        "Abstract": "In critical care environments such as the emergency department (ED), many activities and decisions are not planned. In this study, we developed a new methodology for systematically studying what are these unplanned activities and decisions. This methodology expands the traditional naturalistic decision making (NDM) frameworks by explicitly identifying the role of environmental factors in decision making. We focused on decisions made by ED physicians as they transitioned between tasks. Through ethnographic data collection, we developed a taxonomy of decision types. The empirical data provide important insight to the complexity of the ED environment by highlighting adaptive behavior in this intricate milieu. Our results show that half of decisions in the ED we studied are not planned, rather decisions are opportunistic decision (34%) or influenced by interruptions or distractions (21%). What impacts these unplanned decisions have on the quality, safety, and efficiency in the ED environment are important research topics for future investigation.",

        "Title": "Deviations from protocol in a complex trauma environment: errors or innovations?",
        "Abstract": "Protocol standardizations are important for consistent and safe practices. However, complex clinical environments are highly dynamic in nature and often require clinicians, confronted with non-standard situations, to adjust and deviate from standard protocol. Some of these deviations are errors which can result in harmful outcomes. On the other hand, some of the deviations can be innovations, which are dynamic adjustments to the protocols made by people to adapt the current operational conditions and achieve high accuracy and efficiency. However, there is very little known about the underlying cognitive processes that are related to errors and innovations. In this study we investigate the extent to which deviations are classified as errors or innovations, as a function of expertise in a trauma setting. Field observations were conducted in a Level 1 trauma unit. A total of 10 trauma cases were observed and collected data was analyzed using measures that included customized activity-error-innovation ontology, timestamps and expertise of the team members. The results show that expertise of the caregivers and criticality of a patient's condition in critical care environment influence the number and type of deviations from standard protocol. Experts' deviations were a combination of errors and innovations; whereas the novices' deviations were mostly errors. This research suggests that a novel approach must be taken into consideration for the design of protocols (including standards) and compliance measurements in complex clinical environments.",

        "Abstract": "As the medical education community celebrates the 100th anniversary of the seminal Flexner Report, medical education is once again experiencing significant pressure to transform. Multiple reports from many of medicine's specialties and external stakeholders highlight the inadequacies of current training models to prepare a physician workforce to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse and aging population. This transformation, driven by competency-based medical education (CBME) principles that emphasize the outcomes, will require more effective evaluation and feedback by faculty.Substantial evidence suggests, however, that current faculty are insufficiently prepared for this task across both the traditional competencies of medical knowledge, clinical skills, and professionalism and the newer competencies of evidence-based practice, quality improvement, interdisciplinary teamwork, and systems. The implication of these observations is that the medical education enterprise urgently needs an international initiative of faculty development around CBME and assessment. In this article, the authors outline the current challenges and provide suggestions on where faculty development efforts should be focused and how such an initiative might be accomplished. The public, patients, and trainees need the medical education enterprise to improve training and outcomes now.",

        "Abstract": "In many respects, the critical care workplace resembles a paradigmatic complex system: on account of the dynamic and interactive nature of collaborative clinical work, these settings are characterized by non-linear, inter-dependent and emergent activities. Developing a comprehensive understanding of the work activities in critical care settings enables the development of streamlined work practices, better clinician workflow and most importantly, helps in the avoidance of and recovery from potential errors. Sensor-based technology provides a flexible and viable way to complement human observations by providing a mechanism to capture the nuances of certain activities with greater precision and timing. In this paper, we use sensor-based technology to capture the movement and interactions of clinicians in the Trauma Center of an Emergency Department (ED). Remarkable consistency was found between sensor data and human observations in terms of clinician locations and interactions. With this validation and greater precision with sensors, ED environment was characterized in terms of (a) the degree of randomness or entropy in the environment, (b) the movement patterns of clinicians, (c) interactions with other clinicians and finally, (d) patterns of collaborative organization with team aggregation and dispersion. Based on our results, we propose three opportunities for the use of sensor technologies in critical care settings: as a mechanism for real-time monitoring and analysis for ED activities, education and training of clinicians, and perhaps most importantly, investigating the root-causes, origins and progression of errors in the ED. Lessons learned and the challenges encountered in designing and implementing the sensor technology sensor data are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Federal legislation (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act) has provided funds to support an unprecedented increase in health information technology (HIT) adoption for healthcare provider organizations and professionals throughout the U.S. While recognizing the promise that widespread HIT adoption and meaningful use can bring to efforts to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of healthcare, the American Medical Informatics Association devoted its 2009 Annual Health Policy Meeting to consideration of unanticipated consequences that could result with the increased implementation of HIT. Conference participants focused on possible unintended and unanticipated, as well as undesirable, consequences of HIT implementation. They employed an input-output model to guide discussion on occurrence of these consequences in four domains: technical, human/cognitive, organizational, and fiscal/policy and regulation. The authors outline the conference's recommendations: (1) an enhanced research agenda to guide study into the causes, manifestations, and mitigation of unintended consequences resulting from HIT implementations; (2) creation of a framework to promote sharing of HIT implementation experiences and the development of best practices that minimize unintended consequences; and (3) recognition of the key role of the Federal Government in providing leadership and oversight in analyzing the effects of HIT-related implementations and policies.",

        "Abstract": "The notion that human error should not be tolerated is prevalent in both the public and personal perception of the performance of clinicians. However, researchers in other safety-critical domains have long since abandoned the quest for zero defects as an impractical goal, choosing to focus instead on the development of strategies to enhance the ability to recover from error. This paper presents a cognitive framework for the study of error recovery, and the results of our empirical research into error detection and recovery in the critical care domain, using both laboratory-based and naturalistic approaches. Both attending physicians and residents were prone to commit, detect and recover from errors, but the nature of these errors was different. Experts corrected the errors as soon as they detected them and were better able to detect errors requiring integration of multiple elements in the case. Residents were more cautious in making decisions showing a slower error recovery pattern, and the detected errors were more procedural in nature with specific patient outcomes. Error detection and correction are shown to be dependent on expertise, and on the nature of the everyday tasks of the clinicians concerned. Understanding the limits and failures of human decision-making is important if we are to build robust decision-support systems to manage the boundaries of risk of error in decision-making. Detection and correction of potential error is an integral part of cognitive work in the complex, critical care workplace.",

        "Abstract": "Lapses in patient safety have been linked to unexpected perturbations in clinical workflow. The effectiveness of workflow analysis becomes critical to understanding the impact of these perturbations on patient outcome. The typical methods used for workflow analysis, such as ethnographic observations and interviewing, are limited in their ability to capture activities from different perspectives simultaneously. This limitation, coupled with the complexity and dynamic nature of clinical environments makes understanding the nuances of clinical workflow difficult. The methods proposed in this research aim to provide a quantitative means of capturing and analyzing workflow. The approach taken utilizes recordings of motion and location of clinical teams that are gathered using radio identification tags and observations. This data is used to model activities in critical care environments. The detected activities can then be replayed in 3D virtual reality environments for further analysis and training. Using this approach, the proposed system augments existing methods of workflow analysis, allowing for capture of workflow in complex and dynamic environments. The system was tested with a set of 15 simulated clinical activities that when combined represent workflow in trauma units. A mean recognition rate of 87.5% was obtained in automatically recognizing the activities.",

        "Abstract": "Biomedical researchers often work with massive, detailed and heterogeneous datasets. These datasets raise new challenges of information organization and management for scientific interpretation, as they demand much of the researchers' time and attention. The current study investigated the nature of the problems that researchers face when dealing with such data. Four major problems identified with existing biomedical scientific information management methods were related to data organization, data sharing, collaboration, and publications. Therefore, there is a compelling need to develop an efficient and user-friendly information management system to handle the biomedical research data. This study evaluated the implementation of an information management system, which was introduced as part of the collaborative research to increase scientific productivity in a research laboratory. Laboratory members seemed to exhibit frustration during the implementation process. However, empirical findings revealed that they gained new knowledge and completed specified tasks while working together with the new system. Hence, researchers are urged to persist and persevere when dealing with any new technology, including an information management system in a research laboratory environment.",

        "Abstract": "CONTEXT Telemedicine is a promising but largely unproven technology for providing case management services to patients with chronic conditions and lower access to care. OBJECTIVES To examine the effectiveness of a telemedicine intervention to achieve clinical management goals in older, ethnically diverse, medically underserved patients with diabetes. DESIGN, Setting, and Patients A randomized controlled trial was conducted, comparing telemedicine case management to usual care, with blinded outcome evaluation, in 1,665 Medicare recipients with diabetes, aged >/= 55 years, residing in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York State. Interventions Home telemedicine unit with nurse case management versus usual care. Main Outcome Measures The primary endpoints assessed over 5 years of follow-up were hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure levels. RESULTS Intention-to-treat mixed models showed that telemedicine achieved net overall reductions over five years of follow-up in the primary endpoints (HgbA1c, p = 0.001; LDL, p < 0.001; systolic and diastolic blood pressure, p = 0.024; p < 0.001). Estimated differences (95% CI) in year 5 were 0.29 (0.12, 0.46)% for HgbA1c, 3.84 (-0.08, 7.77) mg/dL for LDL cholesterol, and 4.32 (1.93, 6.72) mm Hg for systolic and 2.64 (1.53, 3.74) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. There were 176 deaths in the intervention group and 169 in the usual care group (hazard ratio 1.01 [0.82, 1.24]). CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine case management resulted in net improvements in HgbA1c, LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure levels over 5 years in medically underserved Medicare beneficiaries. Mortality was not different between the groups, although power was limited. Trial Registration http://clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00271739.",

        "Abstract": "Theoretical and methodological advances in the cognitive and learning sciences can greatly inform curriculum and instruction in biomedicine and also educational programs in biomedical informatics. It does so by addressing issues such as the processes related to comprehension of medical information, clinical problem-solving and decision-making, and the role of technology. This paper reviews these theories and methods from the cognitive and learning sciences and their role in addressing current and future needs in designing curricula, largely using illustrative examples drawn from medical education. The lessons of this past work are also applicable, however, to biomedical and health professional curricula in general, and to biomedical informatics training, in particular. We summarize empirical studies conducted over two decades on the role of memory, knowledge organization and reasoning as well as studies of problem-solving and decision-making in medical areas that inform curricular design. The results of this research contribute to the design of more informed curricula based on empirical findings about how people learn and think, and more specifically, how expertise is developed. Similarly, the study of practice can also help to shape theories of human performance, technology-based learning, and scientific and professional collaboration that extend beyond the domain of medicine. Just as biomedical science has revolutionized health care practice, research in the cognitive and learning sciences provides a scientific foundation for education in biomedicine, the health professions, and biomedical informatics.",

This paper with the focus of Functional Analysis (FA) of AHLTA explores operationalizable methods to study functions supported by user interfaces. A system hierarchy was created to map and uniquely identify all items on the interfaces. These items were then classified independently by 2 evaluators as Operations or Objects. Operations were further classified as either Domain or Overhead function. With acceptable inter-rater agreement, of the 1996 items in the interfaces, 61% were operations, around one fourth of which were Overhead functions. Overhead functions are hypothesized to be targets to be redesigned for improvements in usability.",

        "Abstract": "Critical care environments are inherently complex and dynamic. Assessment of workflow in such environments is not trivial. While existing approaches for workflow analysis such as ethnographic observations and interviewing provide contextualized information about the overall workflow, they are limited in their ability to capture the workflow from all perspectives. This paper presents a tool for automated activity recognition that can provide an additional point of view. Using data captured by Radio Identification (RID) tags and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), key activities in the environment can be modeled and recognized. The proposed method leverages activity recognition systems to provide a snapshot of workflow in critical care environments. The activities representing the workflow can be extracted and replayed using virtual reality environments for further analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Despite a body of research on teams in other fields relatively little is known about measuring teamwork in healthcare. The aim of this study is to characterize the qualitative dimensions of team performance during cardiac resuscitation that results in good and bad outcomes. We studied each team's adherence to Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocol for ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia and identified team behaviors during simulated critical events that affected their performance. The process was captured by a developed task checklist and a validated team work coding system. Results suggest that deviation from the sequence suggested by the ACLS protocol had no impact on the outcome as the successful team deviated more from this sequence than the unsuccessful team. It isn't the deviation from the protocol per se that appears to be important, but how the leadership flexibly adapts to the situational changes with deviations is the crucial factor in team competency.",

This study reports an investigation into the nature of the problems faced by the researchers in two bioscience test laboratories when dealing with their data management applications. Data were collected using ethnographic observations, questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews. The major problems identified in working with these systems were related to data organization, publications, and collaboration. The interoperability standards were analyzed using a C(4)I framework at the level of connection, communication, consolidation, and collaboration. Such an analysis was found to be useful in judging the capabilities of data management systems at different levels of technological competency. While collaboration and system interoperability are the \"must have\" attributes of these biomedical scientific laboratory information management applications, usability and human interoperability are the other design concerns that must also be addressed for easy use and implementation.",

It had been more than 15 years since Edward Shortliffe gave a talk at AIME in which he characterized artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine as being in its \"adolescence\" (Shortliffe EH. The adolescence of AI in medicine: will the field come of age in the '90s? Artificial Intelligence in Medicine 1993;5:93-106). In this article, the discussants reflect on medical AI research during the subsequent years and characterize the maturity and influence that has been achieved to date. Participants focus on their personal areas of expertise, ranging from clinical decision-making, reasoning under uncertainty, and knowledge representation to systems integration, translational bioinformatics, and cognitive issues in both the modeling of expertise and the creation of acceptable systems.",

        "Abstract": "Previous research has questioned the effectiveness of existing methods to identify individuals at high risk for contracting and transmitting human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted diseases. Thus, new approaches are needed to provide these individuals with risk-reduction strategies. We review our research on young adults' sexual decision making by using theories and methods from social and cognitive sciences. Four patterns of condom use and associated levels of risks and beliefs were identified. These patterns suggest value in targeting intervention strategies to individuals at different levels of risk. The findings also imply that the monogamous population may be at higher risk for infection than they realize. Primary-care physicians are the first line of contact for many individuals in the health care system and may be in the best position to screen for at-risk individuals. Given the time demands and other barriers, easy-to-use, evidence-based guidelines for such screening are needed. We propose such guidelines for primary-care physicians to use in identifying an individual's risk, from which custom-tailored intervention strategies can be developed.",

        "Abstract": "Cognitive studies reveal that less-than-expert clinicians are less able to recognize meaningful patterns of data in clinical narratives. Accordingly, psychiatric residents early in training fail to attend to information that is relevant to diagnosis and the assessment of dangerousness. This manuscript presents cognitively motivated methodology for the simulation of expert ability to organize relevant findings supporting intermediate diagnostic hypotheses. Latent Semantic Analysis is used to generate a semantic space from which meaningful associations between psychiatric terms are derived. Diagnostically meaningful clusters are modeled as geometric structures within this space and compared to elements of psychiatric narrative text using semantic distance measures. A learning algorithm is defined that alters components of these geometric structures in response to labeled training data. Extraction and classification of relevant text segments is evaluated against expert annotation, with system-rater agreement approximating rater-rater agreement. A range of biomedical informatics applications for these methods are suggested.",

A complex cognitive system underlies the decision-making process in such cooperative workplaces. This methodological review paper addresses the issues of translating cognitive research to clinical practice with a specific focus on decision-making in critical care, and the role of information and communication technology to aid in such decisions. Examples are drawn from studies of critical care in our own research laboratories. Critical care, in this paper, includes both intensive (inpatient) and emergency (outpatient) care. We define translational cognition as the research on basic and applied cognitive issues that contribute to our understanding of how information is stored, retrieved and used for problem-solving and decision-making. The methods and findings are discussed in the context of constraints on decision-making in real-world complex environments and implications for supporting the design and evaluation of decision support tools for critical care health providers.",

        "Abstract": "Health professions education is dealing with major transformations in light of the changing nature of the health care delivery system, including the use of technology for \"just in time\" delivery of care, evidence-based practice, personalized medical care and learning, as health professionals strive to integrate biomedical advances and clinical practice. This has forced the medical education community to reassess the current teaching and learning practices and more importantly, the evaluation of the medical education process. There have been recent advances in cognitive and learning sciences theories, some of which can inform medical educators about best teaching and learning practices and their impact on the evaluation process. An understanding of these theories provides a sound rationale for choosing specific instructional strategies and choosing evaluation measures that assess the curricular objectives. The review begins with an overview of evaluation and assessment in education, followed by an overview of major theories from the cognitive and learning sciences. Next, the role of cognitive and learning sciences theories in informing the process of medical education evaluation is discussed, including its impact on student learning, performance and professional competence, as well as recommendations for reform of medical curricula based on such theories. The paper continues with the elaboration of current trends in health sciences education, particularly medical education, and available evidence for the impact on student learning and performance as well as areas where more research is needed.",

        "Abstract": "The design of a device's user interface often contributes to the chance of a user making an error in using the device. However, there is evidence that most such errors that occur in practice are attributed solely to the user and that the primary method of error prevention is to retrain the user. Yet this attitude may decrease the quality of error reports and the use of more effective error prevention strategies. A qualitative study was conducted to assess health care employees' attitudes toward device use errors and the prevention of adverse events.",

        "Abstract": "Despite public health initiatives targeting rapid action in response to symptoms of myocardial infarction (MI), people continue to delay in going to a hospital when experiencing these symptoms due to lack of recognition as cardiac-related. The objective of this research was to characterize lay individuals' knowledge of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and associated decision processes for timely action. Thirty participants were interviewed about their knowledge of AMI, then presented with unrelated, unfamiliar and familiar scenarios of AMI symptoms and instructed to \"think aloud\" as they made decisions in response to the scenarios in order to capture the decision process directly. Data were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods to identify the semantic relationships between knowledge and decisions. Results showed that most participants (80%) identified three symptoms or less (e.g., chest pain: 93%; dyspnea: 53%). All participants identified urgent actions (calling 911, going to ED) as the appropriate response to AMI symptoms. Urgent action decisions increased with familiarity of symptoms (57% for unrelated symptoms to 83% for most familiar symptoms), and was highest for the cardiac group. Lay knowledge of AMI is necessary, but not sufficient for people to develop required heuristics for timely action. This ineffective decision increases as a function of ambiguous and unfamiliar situations. Health education interventions should focus on teaching clusters of problems with varying levels of familiarity and complexity to increase flexibility in making decisions.",

        "Abstract": "Interest in studying distractions and interruptions in the context of clinician workflow has increased in light of evidence that these events may negatively impact patient safety. Additionally, many recent informatics-based studies analyze computer provider order entry (CPOE) and clinical information system (CIS) implementation and its effects on clinician workflow. This study expands the development and use of a taxonomy to characterize distractions to clinicians and their subsequent actions in the context of CPOE/CIS use. We found a total of 75 distracting events in 406 minutes of observational data of which 32 led to interruptions and 30 led to continued multitasking. The above primary actions led to 5 tasks not completed and 4 episodes of clinician's lack of recall. Differences in the distribution of the source of distractions and primary action of the distracted clinicians may be a function of clinical setting and clinician type using the CPOE/CIS. Nine secondary actions, potentially resulting in a slip or a mistake, suggest that CPOE may necessitate different forms of safety nets than traditional clinician communication.",

        "Abstract": "Using diary methods, the current study explored characteristics of young adults' sexual risk interactions over a two-week period and the associations between perceived risk and safety with regard to these sexual risk behaviors. We screened all participants to ensure a moderate to high scores on an HIV knowledge measure. Men (n = 44) and women ( n = 48) enrolled at an inner-city college collected diary data, generating reports of 440 sexual occasions over a 2-week period (1,278 person-days). Despite participation in sexual risk activities, including highly inconsistent condom use during intercourse, participants uniformly reported high safety and little to no risk. Only women's perceptions of safety (not risk) were associated with condom use, men's perceptions of both safety and risk were unrelated. Ratings of safety and risk appeared to operate independently for the most part. Sex with new partners and new sexual activity were associated with both judgments of greater risk and lower safety were associated for men only. These results add to the growing evidence that young people fail to integrate fully their general knowledge regarding HIV risk into their personal interactions. This study has implications for the development of cognitive models around sexual decision-making for young adults at risk for HIV and may provide insight into the contextual features of sexual interactions associated with young people's perceptions of risk and safety.",

        "Abstract": "Research into the nature and occurrence of medical errors has shown that these often result from a combination of factors that lead to the breakdown of workflow. Nowhere is this more critical than in the emergency department (ED), where the focus of clinical decisions is on the timely evaluation and stabilization of patients. This paper reports on the nature of errors and their implications for patient safety in an adult ED, using methods of ethnographic observation, interviews, and think-aloud protocols. Data were analyzed using modified \"grounded theory,\" which refers to a theory developed inductively from a body of data. Analysis revealed four classes of errors, relating to errors of misidentification, ranging from multiple medical record numbers, wrong patient identification or address, and in one case, switching of one patient's identification information with those of another. Further analysis traced the root of the errors to ED registration. These results indicate that the nature of errors in the emergency department are complex, multi-layered and result from an intertwined web of activity, in which stress in the work environment, high patient volume and the tendency to adopt shortcuts play a significant role. The need for information technology (IT) solutions to these problems as well as the impact of alternative policies is discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Triage, the first step in the assessment of emergency department patients, occurs in a highly dynamic environment that functions under constraints of time, physical space, and patient needs that may exceed available resources. Through triage, patients are placed into one of a limited number of categories using a subset of diagnostic information. To facilitate this task and standardize the triage decision process, triage guidelines have been implemented. However, these protocols are interpreted differently by highly experienced (expert) nurses and less experienced (novice) nurses. This study investigates the process of triage; the factors that influence triage decision-making, and how the guidelines are used in the process. Using observations and semi-structured interviews of triage nurses, data was collected in the pediatric emergency department of a large Canadian teaching hospital. Results show that in emergency situations (1) triage decisions were often non-analytic and based on intuition, particularly with increasing expertise, and (2) guidelines were used differently by nurses during the triage process. These results suggest that explicit guideline information becomes internalized and implicitly used in emergency triage practice as nurses gain experience. Implications of these results for nursing education and training, and guideline development for emergency care are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Contemporary error research suggests that the quest to eradicate error is misguided. Error commission, detection, and recovery are an integral part of cognitive work, even at the expert level. In collaborative workspaces, the perception of potential error is directly observable: workers discuss and respond to perceived violations of accepted practice norms. As perceived violations are captured and corrected preemptively, they do not fit Reason's widely accepted definition of error as \"failure to achieve an intended outcome.\" However, perceived violations suggest the aversion of potential error, and consequently have implications for error prevention. This research aims to identify and describe perceived violations of the boundaries of accepted procedure in a psychiatric emergency department (PED), and how they are resolved in practice.",

Understanding how an interruption contributes to human error is limited because there is not a standard method for analyzing and classifying interruptions. Qualitative data are typically analyzed by either a deductive or an inductive method. Both methods have limitations. In this paper, a hybrid method was developed that integrates deductive and inductive methods for the categorization of activities and interruptions recorded during an ethnographic study of physicians and registered nurses in a Level One Trauma Center. Understanding the effects of interruptions is important for designing and evaluating informatics tools in particular as well as improving healthcare quality and patient safety in general.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are intended to provide evidence based knowledge for decision making for patient care. However, these guidelines have been poorly adopted by healthcare providers. One reason for this may be the static paper-based formats, isolated from the point of care. Biomedical informatics has provided a solution to this limitation through Computer Interpretable Guidelines (CIGs). An essential component of this process is CPG translation to a computer interpretable model. From the guideline modeling literature, the translators of CPGs typically are physicians. It is not known if other healthcare providers (i.e., Advance Practice Nurses [APNs]) comprehend CPGs similarly. This descriptive study utilized novice and expert APN and physician participants (varied by level of expertise) in a CPG comprehension task. Demographic data, verbal protocols, and recall model drawings were obtained and analyzed by description, protocol analysis, discourse analysis, and content analysis. The findings of this study indicate similar comprehension by the expert APNs and physicians suggesting that either type of expert may be utilized for modeling CPGs.",

        "Abstract": "Many studies have found that clinicians require access to medical knowledge sources while viewing data in their patients' health records. To address this need, we have been developing links to various on-line health information resources from our Web-based clinical information system (WebCIS). Clinicians can access these resources through a \"Health Resources\" Web page or use context-sensitive \"infobuttons\" that automatically link to specific resources. To assist in understanding how clinicians interact with these two mechanisms, we have been exploring the use of an automated approach to answer questions about usage for guiding the further development of links to resources. In this paper, we discuss the use of a knowledge discovery technique (CIS Usage Mining) to obtain usage statistics from log files that record interactions with health resources and infobuttons in WebCIS, describe a Web-based interface developed to present the results, and summarize how the results could be applied. The availability of effective links to on-line medical knowledge sources from the patient health record can assist in resolving information needs, potentially improving patient care and decision-making.",

        "Abstract": "Recent developments in biomedical informatics research have afforded possibilities for great advances in health care delivery. As in most domains, there is a gulf between technologic artifacts and end users, which compromises the culture of safety in the workplace. This necessitates a broadening of disciplinary boundaries to consider cognitive and social factors related to the design and use of technology. The authors argue for a place of prominence for cognitive science in understanding nursing factors associated with patient safety. Cognitive science provides a framework for the analysis and modeling of complex human performance. Studies of clinical cognition can meaningfully inform and shape design, development, and assessment of information systems. Furthermore, they have a decisive impact on whether information technology has a positive influence on human performance and are especially important in understanding and promoting safe practices. These issues are discussed in the context of clinical informatics with a focus on nursing practice.",

        "Abstract": "Several studies have shown that there is information loss during interruptions, and that multitasking creates higher memory load, both of which contribute to medical error. Nowhere is this more critical than in the emergency department (ED), where the emphasis of clinical decision is on the timely evaluation and stabilization of patients. This paper reports on the nature of multitasking and shift change and its implications for patient safety in an adult ED, using the methods of ethnographic observation and interviews. Data were analyzed using grounded theory to study cognition in the context of the work environment. Analysis revealed that interruptions within the ED were prevalent and diverse in nature. On average, there was an interruption every 9 and 14 min for the attending physicians and the residents, respectively. In addition, the workflow analysis showed gaps in information flow due to multitasking and shift changes. Transfer of information began at the point of hand-offs/shift changes and continued through various other activities, such as documentation, consultation, teaching activities and utilization of computer resources. The results show that the nature of the communication process in the ED is complex and cognitively taxing for the clinicians, which can compromise patient safety. The need to tailor existing generic electronic tools to support adaptive processes like multitasking and handoffs in a time-constrained environment is discussed.",

        "Abstract": "The intensive care unit (ICU) is an instance of a very dynamic health care setting where critically ill patients are being managed. To provide good care, an extensive and coordinated communication amongst the role players, use of numerous information systems and operation of devices for monitoring and treatment purposes are required. The purpose of this research is to study error evolution and management within this environment. The focus is on representing the workflow of critical care environment, which emphasizes the importance such a representation may play in strategizing the management of medical errors. We used ethnographic observation and interview data to build individual pieces of the workflow, dependent on the individual and the activity concerned. Key personnel were intensively followed during their respective patient care activities and the related actions. All interactions were recorded for analysis. These clinicians and nurses were interviewed to complement the observation data and to delineate their individual workflows. These pieces of the ICU workflow were used to develop a generalize-able cognitive model to represent the intricate workflow applicable to other health care settings. The proposed model can be used to identify and characterize medical errors and for error prediction in practice.",

        "Abstract": "To create a culture of safe practices, we need to understand how and under what conditions the public makes risky decisions about their health. Because risky sexual behaviors are known to be common in young adults, we investigated their decision making regarding sexual activities that could incur a high risk of HIV infection. Sixty young urban adults maintained journals for two weeks and were interviewed regarding condom use and sexual history. We characterized four patterns of condom use behavior: consistent (35.0%), inconsistent (16.7%), consistent to inconsistent (35.0%), and inconsistent to consistent (13.3%). Directionality of reasoning was analyzed in the explanations provided for condom use decisions. The consistent and inconsistent patterns were associated with data-driven heuristic reasoning, where behavior becomes automated and is associated with a high level of confidence in one's judgment. In the other two patterns, the shift in behavior was due to a significant event that influenced a change in directionality to explanation-based reasoning. We discuss these results within the framework of identifying potentially high-risk groups for whom customized intervention strategies (such as computer-based educational programs) can be used to reduce risk, thereby creating a culture of safer sexual practices.",

However, the appropriate entry strategy in the context of a specific clinical workflow situation may not be apparent to users. We have conducted a cognitive analysis of user interaction strategies for entering IV injection orders using a commercial CPOE system. We characterized the set of available information resources in the system interface and in the users' memory, and evaluated how effectively the application supported decision-making processes. Seven internal medicine residents participated in an experiment entering IV heparin orders to manage anticoagulation therapy. The analysis showed that efficiency was contingent upon high level of procedural and conceptual system knowledge. CPOE interface design needs to conform to decision-making and workflow processes if the technology is to become an effective clinical tool.",

        "Abstract": "Certain applications require computer systems to approximate intended human meaning. This is achievable in constrained domains with a finite number of concepts. Areas such as psychiatry, however, draw on concepts from the world-at-large. A knowledge structure with broad scope is required to comprehend such domains. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is an unsupervised corpus-based statistical method that derives quantitative estimates of the similarity between words and documents from their contextual usage statistics. The aim of this research was to evaluate the ability of LSA to derive meaningful associations between concepts relevant to the assessment of dangerousness in psychiatry. An expert reference model of dangerousness was used to guide the construction of a relevant corpus. Derived associations between words in the corpus were evaluated qualitatively. A similarity-based scoring function was used to assign dangerousness categories to discharge summaries. LSA was shown to derive intuitive relationships between concepts and correlated significantly better than random with human categorization of psychiatric discharge summaries according to dangerousness. The use of LSA to derive a simulated knowledge structure can extend the scope of computer systems beyond the boundaries of constrained conceptual domains.",

However, the emotional component is rarely addressed within these models. This paper reviews evidence for the emotional aspect of decision-making and its role within a new framework of investigation, called neuroeconomics. The new approach aims to build a comprehensive theory of decision-making, through the unification of theories and methods from economics, psychology, and neuroscience. In this paper, we review these integrative research methods and their applications to issues of public health, with illustrative examples from our research on young adults' safe sex practices. This approach promises to be valuable as a comprehensively descriptive and possibly, better predictive model for construction and customization of decision support tools for health professionals and consumers.",

Our study examined the relationships among knowledge, decision-making strategies, and risk assessment about HIV by youths during peer group focused discussions. Two focus groups with first-year college students were conducted, with a series of questions about risk for HIV transmission as prompts. All group interactions were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using methods of discourse analysis to characterize a detailed description of the interactions. The results indicated that youths negotiated their perspectives with the use of justification and elaboration to support alternative opinions and positions. They used concrete experiential examples to further explain and illustrate their positions, Opposing views or arguments met with requests for clarification and further negotiation. This cycle of clarification-negotiation shaped their understanding of HIV-related concepts. The use of strategies, such as justification of alternative positions and the use of examples as support for arguments to clarify and negotiate various perspectives, could be used as a tool for designing educational programs to improve understanding of health related issues, such as HIV transmission and prevention.",

        "Abstract": "Online medical information, when presented to clinicians, must be well-organized and intuitive to use, so that the clinicians can conduct their daily work efficiently and without error. It is essential to actively seek to produce good user interfaces that are acceptable to the user. This paper describes the methodology used to develop a simplified heuristic evaluation (HE) suitable for the evaluation of screen shots of Web pages, the development of an HE instrument used to conduct the evaluation, and the results of the evaluation of the aforementioned screen shots. In addition, this paper presents examples of the process of categorizing problems identified by the HE and the technological solutions identified to resolve these problems. Four usability experts reviewed 18 paper-based screen shots and made a total of 108 comments. Each expert completed the task in about an hour. We were able to implement solutions to approximately 70% of the violations. Our study found that a heuristic evaluation using paper-based screen shots of a user interface was expeditious, inexpensive, and straightforward to implement.",

        "Abstract": "This study investigates the effect of curricular change on knowledge integration and reasoning processes during problem-solving by medical students. The curricular change involved the introduction of problem-based, small group tutorials into a conventional health science curriculum (CC). Students at three levels of training were asked to provide diagnostic explanations of two clinical cases, both before (spontaneous) and after (primed) being exposed to basic science information relevant to the clinical problems. Data were analyzed using techniques of propositional and semantic analysis. Based on theories of instruction and cognition, we expected that the instructional changes would facilitate knowledge integration and influence the reasoning patterns of the students. The results show that students generated fewer inferences and used more information from the basic science text (text-based) to explain the clinical problems. However, they generated a greater number of elaborations during explanations using a mixture of data-driven and hypothesis-driven strategies. The spontaneous and primed problem-solving conditions produced more hypothesis-driven and data-driven strategies, respectively, as would be expected in a hybrid curriculum. We conclude that a) problem-based, small group tutorials facilitate integration of clinical and biomedical knowledge through the use of elaborations and hypothesis-driven strategies, and b) aspects of problem-based learning can be successfully integrated into traditional curricula.",

The best way to eliminate these errors is to understand how they are generated, thus enabling the future development of methods to catch errors made in creating the guideline before publication. We examined the process by which a medical expert from the American College of Physicians (ACP) created clinical algorithms from narrative guidelines, as a case study. We studied this process by looking at intermediate versions produced during the algorithm creation. We identified and analyzed errors that were generated at each stage, categorized them using Knuth's classification scheme, and studied patterns of errors that were made over the set of algorithm versions that were created. We then assessed possible explanations for the sources of these errors and provided recommendations for reducing the number of errors, based on cognitive theory and on experience drawn from software engineering methodologies.",

        "Abstract": "Recent developments in biomedical informatics research have afforded possibilities for great advances in health care delivery. These exciting opportunities also present a number of challenges to the implementation and integration of technologies in the workplace. As in most domains, there is a gulf between technologic artifacts and end users, which compromises the culture of safety in the workplace. Because clinical practice is a human endeavor, there is a need for bridging disciplines to enable clinicians to benefit from rapid technologic advances. This, in turn, necessitates a broadening of disciplinary boundaries to consider cognitive and social factors related to the design and use of technology. The authors argue for a place of prominence for cognitive science in understanding nursing factors associated with patient safety. Cognitive science provides a framework for the analysis and modeling of complex human performance. Studies of clinical cognition can meaningfully inform and shape design, development and assessment of information systems. Furthermore, they have a decisive impact on whether information technology has a positive influence on human performance and are especially important in understanding and promoting safe practices. These issues are discussed in the context of clinical informatics with a focus on nursing practice.",

We developed and refined our methods during a study involving eight participants living in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-affected areas (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Toronto). The framework is an adaptation of narrative analysis, a qualitative method that is used to investigate a phenomenon through interpretation of the stories people tell about their experiences. From our work, several hypotheses emerged that will contribute to future research. For example, our findings showed that many decisions in an epidemic are carefully considered and involve use of significant information gathering. Having a good model of lay actions based on information received and beliefs held will contribute to the development of more effective information support systems in the event of a future epidemic.",

This stands in sharp contrast with paucity of research that deals with the public's comprehension of disaster information and related decision-making. The objective of this paper is to outline a theoretical and methodological framework for research on lay comprehension of crisis information. The proposed framework integrates two bodies of research: (1) cognitive science literature on comprehension and decision-making and (2) studies of the effects of anxiety on performance. The paper reviews selected works and methods from both fields, discussing how cognitive perspective could be extended to include emotional factors. We also discuss how further research integrating the proposed framework with public health communication perspective could: (1) provide insights for developing effective disaster communication and (2) inform the development of technological support for disaster communication and for education of lay people and health professionals.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents the perspectives of personnel involved in decision-making about devices in critical care. We use the concept of \"sharp and blunt ends\" of practice to describe the performance of health care professionals. The \"sharp end\" is physically and temporally close to the system; the \"blunt end\" is removed from the system in time and space and yet affects the system through indirect influence on the sharp end. In this study, the sharp end is represented by the clinicians (nurses and doctors) and the blunt end by the administrators and biomedical engineers. These subjects represent the professionals involved in the decision-making process for purchasing biomedical equipment for the hospital. They were asked to \"think aloud\" while evaluating three error scenarios based on real events. The responses were recorded and transcribed for analysis. The results show differences in interpretation of critical events as a function of professional expertise. The clinicians (sharp-end practitioners) focused on clinical and human aspect of errors while the biomedical engineers focused on device-related errors. The administrators focused on documentation and training. These different interpretations mean that the problems are represented differently by these groups of subjects, and these representations result in variable decisions about devices. These results are discussed within a systems approach framework to help us assess the completeness of the problem representations of the subjects, their awareness of critical events, and how these events would collectively contribute to the occurrence of error.",

        "Abstract": "This case study of a serious medication error demonstrates the necessity of a comprehensive methodology for the analysis of failures in interaction between humans and information systems. The authors used a novel approach to analyze a dosing error related to computer-based ordering of potassium chloride (KCl). The method included a chronological reconstruction of events and their interdependencies from provider order entry usage logs, semistructured interviews with involved clinicians, and interface usability inspection of the ordering system. Information collected from all sources was compared and evaluated to understand how the error evolved and propagated through the system. In this case, the error was the product of faults in interaction among human and system agents that methods limited in scope to their distinct analytical domains would not identify. The authors characterized errors in several converging aspects of the drug ordering process: confusing on-screen laboratory results review, system usability difficulties, user training problems, and suboptimal clinical system safeguards that all contributed to a serious dosing error. The results of the authors' analysis were used to formulate specific recommendations for interface layout and functionality modifications, suggest new user alerts, propose changes to user training, and address error-prone steps of the KCl ordering process to reduce the risk of future medication dosing errors.",

        "Abstract": "Reasoning strategies are a key component in many medical tasks, including decision making, clinical problem solving, and understanding of medical texts. Identification of reasoning strategies used by clinicians may prove critical to the optimal design of decision support systems. This paper presents a formal method of cognitive-semantic analysis for the identification and characterization of reasoning strategies deployed in medical tasks and demonstrates its use through specific examples. Although semantic analysis was originally developed in the investigation of knowledge structures, it can also be applied to identify the reasoning and decision processes used by physicians and medical trainees in clinical tasks. Assumptions underlying the methods, as well as illustrations of their use in diagnostic explanation tasks, are presented. We discuss semantic analysis in the context of the current interests in developing medical ontologies and argue that a frame-based propositional analytic methodology can provide a systematic way of addressing the construction of such ontologies. Although the application of propositional analysis methods has some limitations, we show how such limitations are being addressed and present some examples of information tools that have been developed to ease, and make more systematic, the process of analysis.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, we show how medical devices used for patient care can be made safer if various cognitive factors involved in patient management are taken into consideration during the design phase. The objective of this paper is to describe a methodology for obtaining insights into patient safety features--derived from investigations of institutional decision making--that could be incorporated into medical devices by their designers. The design cycle of a product, be it a medical device, software, or any kind of equipment, is similar in concept, and course. Through a series of steps we obtained information related to medical errors and patient safety. These were then utilized to customize the generic device design cycle in ways that would improve the production of critical care devices. First, we provided individuals with different levels of expertise in the clinical, administrative, and engineering domains of a large hospital setting with hypothetical clinical scenarios, each of which described a medical error event involving health professionals and medical devices. Then, we asked our subjects to \"think-aloud\" as they read through each scenario. Using a set of questions as probes, we then asked our subjects to identify key errors and attribute them to various players. We recorded and transcribed the responses and conducted a cognitive task analysis of each scenario to identify different entities as \"constant,\" \"partially modifiable,\" or \"modifiable.\" We compared our subjects' responses to the results of the task analysis and then mapped them to the modifiable entities. Lastly, we coded the relationships of these entities to the errors in medical devices. We propose that the incorporation of these modifiable entities into the device design cycle could improve the device end product for better patient safety management.",

Two studies were conducted to examine the participants' perceptions of both the short-term (spring 2002) and the long-term influences (1993 through 2002) on knowledge, skills, and behavior. Data were collected through the use of questionnaires, semistructured telephone interviews, and participant observation methods to provide both quantitative and qualitative assessment. The participants of the spring 2002 course considered the course to be an excellent opportunity to increase their knowledge and understanding of the field of medical informatics as well as to meet and interact with other professionals in the field to establish future collaborations. Past participants remained highly satisfied with their experience at Woods Hole and its influence on their professional careers and their involvement in a broad range of activities related to medical informatics. This group considered their knowledge and understanding of medical informatics to be of greater quality, had increased their networking with other professionals, and were more confident and motivated to work in the field. Many of the participants feel and show evidence of becoming effective agents of change in their institutions in the area of medical informatics, which is one of the objectives of the program.",

In addition to serving as an interface to the GLIF3 guideline representation model to support the specified functions, GLEE provides defined interfaces to electronic medical records (EMRs) and other clinical applications to facilitate its integration with the clinical information system at a local institution. The execution model of GLEE takes the \"system suggests, user controls\" approach. A tracing system is used to record an individual patient's state when a guideline is applied to that patient. GLEE can also support an event-driven execution model once it is linked to the clinical event monitor in a local environment. Evaluation has shown that GLEE can be used effectively for proper execution of guidelines encoded in the GLIF3 format. When using it to execute each guideline in the evaluation, GLEE's performance duplicated that of the reference systems implementing the same guideline but taking different approaches. The execution flexibility and generality provided by GLEE, and its integration with a local environment, need to be further evaluated in clinical settings. Integration of GLEE with a specific event-monitoring and order-entry environment is the next step of our work to demonstrate its use for clinical decision support. Potential uses of GLEE also include quality assurance, guideline development, and medical education.",

        "Title": "Relationship between small group problem-solving activity and lectures in health science curricula.",
        "Abstract": "Components of problem-based education, such as small group teaching, are being implemented in diverse health curricula. Implementation, however, is often motivated by the intuitive appeal of many problem-based learning components, when what is needed is the detailed examination of how these components support students' integration of knowledge as well as continuity of their learning experiences. This study presents an investigation of the relationship between lecture and small group teaching (SGT) in a medical curriculum. Four problem-oriented SGT sessions representing diverse topics in the first-year curriculum and their corresponding lectures were videotaped and analyzed using techniques of concept mapping, where the broad concepts from the lectures were identified and matched to the case-specific concepts in the small group sessions. The results show that lectures function as an anchor for the students' discussion of issues relevant to clinical problem-solving and interventions in small group sessions. These discussions extended to contextual aspects of clinical practice that were not dealt with in the lectures, such as ethical/cultural issues around the treatment of patients. Furthermore, small group environments were found to promote discussions that allowed the integration of information from different sources and encompassed concepts across a number of disciplines. These results suggest that carefully designed small group sessions serve the purposes of 1) illustrating broader concepts in lectures to case-specific, clinically relevant problem-solving and 2) promoting knowledge integration from diverse sources of information. The implications of these results for learning and reasoning in health science curricula are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Many medical devices that are currently on the market are sub-optimal for human use, thus contributing to medical errors. This places significant responsibility for device selection on purchasers. This paper describes a retrospective analysis of decision making processes for infusion pump selection in three large hospitals and focuses on patient safety. Through a series of detailed interviews and a study of relevant documentation we characterized the nature of the decision-making, patterns of communication, and the roles of different participants. Findings suggest that success of the process is related to effective communication among participants with different expertise and adequate device usability assessment during the process. The paper discusses how information technology could provide support to distributed institutional decision making.",

The system is designed to support therapeutic decision making. In this paper, we present a multifaceted cognitive evaluation of this system. The evaluation includes a cognitive walkthrough which is a task-analytic method for usability evaluation. We also conducted cognitive studies of two trainee and two attending psychiatrists using the system. One of the attending subjects is presented as a case study. An objective of this research is to characterize the way PSYCKES mediates reasoning. The study found that clinicians were able to use the system effectively to extract and coordinate information and draw appropriate inferences. The expert clinicians were better able to construct a coherent patient representation. The study also documented a few usability problems pertaining to the temporal integration of patient data. PSYCKES is a multifaceted tool that can significantly enhance therapeutic decision making.",

        "Abstract": "Provider order entry systems (POE) often incorporate active decision-support component for drug dosing. The efficacy of automated alerts that suggest dose amounts to the clinician in real time depends in part on how well they are timed to fit into the decision process and on their representational structure. We have conducted a cognitive evaluation of an interaction with a POE system that offered active decision support for heparin dosing with the goal of characterizing its effectiveness and opportunities for error. Two researchers completed a cognitive walk-through of an ordering task based on a clinical scenario. In addition, seven clinicians were asked to enter a set of orders in an experiment using the same scenario. The analysis revealed that users without a solid conceptual knowledge of the ordering system followed patterns of inefficient interactive behavior resulting in delays and some errors. Physicians often did not take full advantage of automatic dose computation provided by a decision support component and used it largely as reference. The calculated dose was not perceptually salient in the generated alert and required users to engage in meaning interpretation of the displayed information. Better visual presentation of the alert message would likely result in faster and less cognitively demanding interaction.",

GLIF3 enables encoding of a guideline at three levels: a conceptual flowchart, a computable specification that can be verified for logical consistency and completeness, and an implementable specification that is intended to be incorporated into particular institutional information systems. The representation has been tested on a wide variety of guidelines that are typical of the range of guidelines in clinical use. It builds upon GLIF2 by adding several constructs that enable interpretation of encoded guidelines in computer-based decision-support systems. GLIF3 leverages standards being developed in Health Level 7 in order to allow integration of guidelines with clinical information systems. The GLIF3 specification consists of an extensible object-oriented model and a structured syntax based on the resource description framework (RDF). Empirical validation of the ability to generate appropriate recommendations using GLIF3 has been tested by executing encoded guidelines against actual patient data. GLIF3 is accordingly ready for broader experimentation and prototype use by organizations that wish to evaluate its ability to capture the logic of clinical guidelines, to implement them in clinical systems, and thereby to provide integrated decision support to assist clinicians.",

        "Abstract": "Increasingly healthcare policy and decision makers are demanding evidence to justify investments in health information systems. This demand requires an adequate evaluation of these systems. A wide variety of approaches and methodologies have been applied in assessing the impact of information systems in health care, ranging from controlled clinical trials to use of questionnaires and interviews with users. In this paper we describe methodological approaches which we have applied and refined for the past 10 years for the evaluation of health information systems. The approaches are strongly rooted in theories and methods from cognitive science and the emerging field of usability engineering. The focus is on assessing human computer interaction and in particular, the usability of computer systems in both laboratory and naturalistic settings. The methods described can be a part of the formative evaluation of systems during their iterative development, and can also complement more traditional assessment methods used in summative system evaluation of completed systems. The paper provides a review of the general area of systems evaluation with the motivation and rationale for methodological approaches underlying usability engineering and cognitive task analysis as applied to health information systems. This is followed by a detailed description of the methods we have applied in a variety of settings in conducting usability testing and usability inspection of systems such as computer-based patient records. Emerging trends in the evaluation of complex information systems are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Medical errors are often associated with inadequate cognitive processing that is based upon impaired access to information.1 Understanding the information needs of nurses and physicians' when using a clinical information system (CIS) is difficult largely because there are few systematic attempts made to do so. We collected 15.5 hours of data of nurses and physicians' CIS interactions in three clinical environments (cardiac ICU, a general medical/surgical nursing, and an ambulatory clinic). We accomplished this through observational, cognitive-based methods (e.g., thinking aloud during interaction) and the video capturing of events with a portable usability laboratory.2 We developed a systematic approach to identify and define in-context clinical information needs while using a CIS, and determine how to categorize and code such events. 3",

        "Abstract": "Inadequate access to patient information at the point of care has been identified as an impediment to the health care process. To create clinical computing tools that are useful to and used by clinicians, developers of clinical information systems must have accurate models of the users for whom their systems are intended. To create these models, the information needs of clinicians must be understood. While the wireless handheld environment offers many advantages such as the ability to provide mobile access to information, there are a number of challenges. Developing for this environment differs from the laptop and desktop environments due to features such as processing power, screen size, input mechanism, and bandwidth. PalmCIS (Palm-based Clinical Information System) is a clinical application being developed at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) that provides clinicians with access to patient data via a wireless handheld device. We are using an automated technique to uncover patient-specific information needs of clinicians while using a patient record system. With the results, we can enhance PalmCIS.",

For this purpose, we extracted a set of generalized guideline execution tasks from the existing guideline representation models. We then created the mappings between specific guideline representation models and the set of the common guideline execution tasks. Finally, we developed a generic task-scheduling model to harmonize the existing approaches to guideline task scheduling. The evaluation has shown that the GESDOR model can be used for the effective execution of guidelines encoded in different formats, and thus realizes guideline sharing at the execution level.",

        "Abstract": "As the healthcare industry transitions from paper to electronic medical records (EMRs), medical informatics researchers face the task of ensuring that the electronic presentation of the information remains usable and effective while capitalizing on the ability of EMRs to tailor information to different users. In our research, we focus on utilizing formal cognitive science methodology to guide the conversion of paper-based narrative discharge summaries to a more dynamic, structured electronic version. In this paper, we present the results of a cognitive analytic study (1) that determines a 'core' component in medical narratives and (2) that compares the use of structured and narrative texts by physicians with varying expertise. Specifically, we studied six psychiatrists at three levels of expertise- experts, intermediates, and novices. The subjects were given two clinical case scenarios with discharge summaries and asked to verbalize their thoughts as they read through the summaries. The interview transcripts were analyzed for recalls and inferences generated in the verbalization. Based on experts' verbalizations, the discharge summaries were organized into a more structured form and used in the interview of other subjects. Novice-level subjects had more recall with the structured than with the narrative format. More errors were also made in recall with the narrative than with the structured text. We discuss how these results are valuable in designing an EMR interface to reduce errors and to support users of different expertise.",

        "Abstract": "Computer-based provider order entry (POE) can reduce the frequency of preventable medical errors. However, overly complex interfaces frequently pose a challenge to users and impede clinical efficacy. We present a cognitive analysis of clinician interaction with a commercial POE system. Our investigation was informed by the distributed resources model, a novel approach designed to describe the dimensions of user interfaces that introduce unnecessary cognitive complexity. This approach characterizes the relative distribution of user's internal representations and external representations embodied in the system or environmental artifacts. The research consisted of two component analyses: a modified cognitive walkthrough evaluation and a simulated clinical ordering task performed by seven physicians. The analysis revealed that the configuration of resources placed unnecessarily heavy cognitive demands on the user, especially those who lacked a robust conceptual model of the system. The resources model was also used to account for patterns of errors produced by clinicians.",

        "Abstract": "This paper introduces an extended hierarchical task analysis (HTA) methodology devised to evaluate and compare user interfaces on volumetric infusion pumps. The pumps were studied along the dimensions of overall usability and propensity for generating human error. With HTA as our framework, we analyzed six pumps on a variety of common tasks using Norman's Action theory. The introduced method of evaluation divides the problem space between the external world of the device interface and the user's internal cognitive world, allowing for predictions of potential user errors at the human-device level. In this paper, one detailed analysis is provided as an example, comparing two different pumps on two separate tasks. The results demonstrate the inherent variation, often the cause of usage errors, found with infusion pumps being used in hospitals today. The reported methodology is a useful tool for evaluating human performance and predicting potential user errors with infusion pumps and other simple medical devices.",

        "Abstract": "Promoting patient safety is a national priority. To evaluate interventions for reducing medical errors and adverse event, effective methods for detecting such events are required. This paper reviews the current methodologies for detection of adverse events and discusses their relative advantages and limitations. It also presents a cognitive framework for error monitoring and detection. While manual chart review has been considered the \"gold-standard\" for identifying adverse events in many patient safety studies, this methodology is expensive and imperfect. Investigators have developed or are currently evaluating, several electronic methods that can detect adverse events using coded data, free-text clinical narratives, or a combination of techniques. Advances in these systems will greatly facilitate our ability to monitor adverse events and promote patient safety research. But these systems will perform optimally only if we improve our understanding of the fundamental nature of errors and the ways in which the human mind can naturally, but erroneously, contribute to the problems that we observe.",

        "Abstract": "Many medical errors that involve drug infusion devices are related to classic interface problems. Although manufacturers are becoming increasingly aware of human factors design considerations, many devices that are currently on the market are still sub-optimal for human use. This places significant responsibility for device selection on institutional purchasing groups. Theories of naturalistic decision-making point to many potential strengths and pitfalls of group decision-making processes that may affect the final outcome. This paper describes a retrospective analysis of decision-making process for infusion pump selection in a large hospital and focuses on factors related to patient safety. Through a series of detailed interviews and a study of relevant documentation we characterized the nature of the decision-making, patterns of communication, and the roles of different participants. Findings show that although the process involves a number of different professional groups and committees, the information flow among them is restricted. This results in inadequate representation of critical device usability considerations in the decision-making process. While all participants view device safety as an important consideration in the selection process, administrators (who are the final decision-makers) tend to equate safety with technical accuracy and reliability, paying less attention to the role of human factors in safe device use. Findings suggest that collaborative communication technology and automated evidence-based guidelines could provide support to institutional decision-making, ensuring that the process is efficient, effective, and ultimately safe for the patients.",

        "Abstract": "Computer-assisted provider order entry is a technology that is designed to expedite medical ordering and to reduce the frequency of preventable errors. This paper presents a multifaceted cognitive methodology for the characterization of cognitive demands of a medical information system. Our investigation was informed by the distributed resources (DR) model, a novel approach designed to describe the dimensions of user interfaces that introduce unnecessary cognitive complexity. This method evaluates the relative distribution of external (system) and internal (user) representations embodied in system interaction. We conducted an expert walkthrough evaluation of a commercial order entry system, followed by a simulated clinical ordering task performed by seven clinicians. The DR model was employed to explain variation in user performance and to characterize the relationship of resource distribution and ordering errors. The analysis revealed that the configuration of resources in this ordering application placed unnecessarily heavy cognitive demands on the user, especially on those who lacked a robust conceptual model of the system. The resources model also provided some insight into clinicians' interactive strategies and patterns of associated errors. Implications for user training and interface design based on the principles of human-computer interaction in the medical domain are discussed.",

The primary goal of InterMed has been to develop a sharable language that could serve as a standard for modeling computer-interpretable guidelines (CIGs). This language, called GuideLine Interchange Format (GLIF), has been developed in a collaborative manner and in an open process that has welcomed input from the larger community. The goals and experiences of the InterMed project and lessons that the authors have learned may contribute to the work of other researchers who are developing medical knowledge-based tools. The lessons described include (1) a work process for multi-institutional research and development that considers different viewpoints, (2) an evolutionary lifecycle process for developing medical knowledge representation formats, (3) the role of cognitive methodology to evaluate and assist in the evolutionary development process, (4) development of an architecture and (5) design principles for sharable medical knowledge representation formats, and (6) a process for standardization of a CIG modeling language.",

We sought to study the character and impact of such access to determine how patients use such records, what cognitive effects it has on them, and how it affects their relationship with their health care providers. We created the Patient Clinical Information System (PatCIS) to interface with the clinical data repository at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) to allow patients to add to and review their medical data. We also provided educational resources and automated advice programs. We provided access to the system to thirteen subjects over a 36-month period and reviewed their activities in the system's usage log. We also collected data via questionnaire and telephone interview. We collected data for a total of 223 patient months. We found that patients varied in their use of the system, from once a month or less to one or more times per day. All patients primarily used the system to review laboratory results. Both they and their physicians believed that use of the system enhanced the patients' understanding of their conditions and improved their communication with their physicians. There were no adverse events encountered during the study.",

        "Abstract": "Representation of clinical practice guidelines in a computer-interpretable format is a critical issue for guideline development, implementation, and evaluation. We studied 11 types of guideline representation models that can be used to encode guidelines in computer-interpretable formats. We have consistently found in all reviewed models that primitives for representation of actions and decisions are necessary components of a guideline representation model. Patient states and execution states are important concepts that closely relate to each other. Scheduling constraints on representation primitives can be modeled as sequences, concurrences, alternatives, and loops in a guideline's application process. Nesting of guidelines provides multiple views to a guideline with different granularities. Integration of guidelines with electronic medical records can be facilitated by the introduction of a formal model for patient data. Data collection, decision, patient state, and intervention constitute four basic types of primitives in a guideline's logic flow. Decisions clarify our understanding on a patient's clinical state, while interventions lead to the change from one patient state to another.",

        "Abstract": "One critical step in addressing and resolving the problems associated with human errors is the development of a cognitive taxonomy of such errors. In the case of errors, such a taxonomy may be developed (1) to categorize all types of errors along cognitive dimensions, (2) to associate each type of error with a specific underlying cognitive mechanism, (3) to explain why, and even predict when and where, a specific error will occur, and (4) to generate intervention strategies for each type of error. Based on Reason's (1992) definition of human errors and Norman's (1986) cognitive theory of human action, we have developed a preliminary action-based cognitive taxonomy of errors that largely satisfies these four criteria in the domain of medicine. We discuss initial steps for applying this taxonomy to develop an online medical error reporting system that not only categorizes errors but also identifies problems and generates solutions.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical guidelines aim to eliminate clinician errors, reduce practice variation, and promote best medical practices. Computer-interpretable guidelines (CIGs) can deliver patient-specific advice during clinical encounters, which makes them more likely to affect clinician behavior than narrative guidelines. To reduce the number of errors that are introduced while developing narrative guidelines and CIGs, we studied the process used by the ACP-ASIM to develop clinical algorithms from narrative guidelines. We analyzed how changes progressed between subsequent versions of an algorithm and between a narrative guideline and its derived clinical algorithm. We recommend procedures that could limit the number of errors produced when generating clinical algorithms. In addition, we developed a tool for authoring CIGs in GLIF3 format and validating their syntax, data type matches, cardinality constraints, and structural integrity constraints. We used this tool to author guidelines and to check them for errors.",

        "Abstract": "This paper reports the effects of a tailored Web-based delivery system on self-efficacy as it relates to a patients' response to acute myocardial information (AMI) symptoms. The data reported are from MI-HEART, a randomized trial examining ways in which a clinical information system can favorably influence the appropriateness and rapidity of decision-making in patients suffering from symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. Participants were randomized into one of three groups: tailored Web-based, non-tailored Web-based and non-tailored paper based. A theoretically based behavioral-cognitive model was used to identify key variables upon which to tailor education material. A key variable in the model is self-efficacy, operationalized with a three-dimensional scaling. Results show trends in improved self-efficacy scores for all groups at 1-month follow up, with sustained significant increases in baseline to 3-month scores only in the tailored Web-based group. One possible explanation could be related to \"hit-count\", which was significantly higher in the tailored group. This study is a first step in quantifying the contribution of Web-based tailoring over non-tailoring in changing key determinants of patient delay to AMI symptoms.",

        "Abstract": "We hypothesize that when clinicians review clinical data in an electronic medical record, the information needs that arise are predictable, based on a number of situational factors. Because our theory does not say, exactly, what those needs are, we are using an empirical approach (observation) to detecting and categorizing them. For each need, we can construct an \"infobutton\" that links the clinical data to an on-line information resource. We have constructed an Infobutton Manager to match the data being reviewed by clinicians with context-appropriate infobuttons. This paper describes how the theory, observations, and practical solutions can come together to improve clinician decision making by resolving information needs.",

        "Abstract": "The limitations of the classical or traditional paradigm of decision research are increasingly apparent, even though there has been a substantial body of empirical research on medical decision-making over the past 40 years. As decision-support technology continues to proliferate in medical settings, it is imperative that \"basic science\" decision research develop a broader-based and more valid foundation for the study of medical decision-making as it occurs in the natural setting. This paper critically reviews both traditional and recent approaches to medical decision making, considering the integration of problem-solving and decision-making research paradigms, the role of conceptual knowledge in decision-making, and the emerging paradigm of naturalistic decision-making. We also provide an examination of technology-mediated decision-making. Expanding the scope of decision research will better enable us to understand optimal decision processes, suitable coping mechanisms under suboptimal conditions, the development of expertise in decision-making, and ways in which decision-support technology can successfully mediate decision processes.",

In this study, participants were asked to read and interpret three pharmaceutical labels related to children's medications of varying complexity: oral rehydration therapy (ORT); over-the-counter cough medicine; and over-the-counter fever medicine. Results indicate that: (1) all groups of participants had considerable difficulty in interpreting the instructions; (2), cultural and educational background appeared to be only weakly related to the accuracy of dosage and administration; and (3) errors of comprehension were related to three features of the texts: situation-representational complexity, inherent quantification complexity, and conformity with intuitive models of therapy based on prior knowledge. The results are discussed in terms of the role of multiple representations (boundary objects) and theories of text comprehension to facilitate the reduction of errors.",

        "Abstract": "This paper examines the role of medical expertise in clinical reasoning, using a complete workup of a patient with an endocrine disorder. Endocrinologists, housestaff, and final year medical students were asked to develop the case. This consisted of history-taking, interpreting physical examination results, request for tests and their interpretations, and providing therapeutic and patient management plans, and an explanation of the pathophysiology underlying the problem. The subjects were also asked to provide explanations supporting their decisions during the patient workup. A variety of techniques deriving from cognitive psychology were used to analyze the data. The main concern was how expertise affected the building of relationship between the components of the workup. Experts formed integrated knowledge-rich structures that were generated during the history-taking and used consistently throughout the workup. Housestaff formed more tentative and less integrated representations which were modified during the patient encounter. Students representations superficially resembled those of experts, but were knowledge-lean. The results are interpreted in terms of clinical performance of endocrinologists, housestaff, and students during the workup, and its relationship to the explanation task as an indicator of clinical competence of the patient problem provided by the subjects. It is proposed that the explanation given after the problem solving process could be used as an indicator of clinical competence.",
