        "Abstract": "Genomes sometimes undergo large-scale rearrangements. Programmed genome rearrangements in ciliates offer an extreme example, making them a compelling model system to study DNA rearrangements. Currently, available methods for genome annotation are not adequate for highly scrambled genomes. We present a theoretical framework and software implementation for the systematic extraction and analysis of DNA rearrangement annotations from pairs of genome assemblies corresponding to precursor and product versions. The software makes no assumptions about the structure of the rearrangements, and permits the user to select parameters to suit the data. Compared to previous approaches, this work achieves more complete precursor-product mappings, allows for full transparency and reproducibility, and can be adapted to genomic data from different sources.",

        "Abstract": "The germline-soma divide is a fundamental distinction in developmental biology, and different genes are expressed in germline and somatic cells throughout metazoan life cycles. Ciliates, a group of microbial eukaryotes, exhibit germline-somatic nuclear dimorphism within a single cell with two different genomes. The ciliate Oxytricha trifallax undergoes massive RNA-guided DNA elimination and genome rearrangement to produce a new somatic macronucleus (MAC) from a copy of the germline micronucleus (MIC). This process eliminates noncoding DNA sequences that interrupt genes and also deletes hundreds of germline-limited open reading frames (ORFs) that are transcribed during genome rearrangement. Here, we update the set of transcribed germline-limited ORFs (TGLOs) in O. trifallax. We show that TGLOs tend to be expressed during nuclear development and then are absent from the somatic MAC. We also demonstrate that exposure to synthetic RNA can reprogram TGLO retention in the somatic MAC and that TGLO retention leads to transcription outside the normal developmental program. These data suggest that TGLOs represent a group of developmentally regulated protein-coding sequences whose gene expression is terminated by DNA elimination.",

        "Abstract": "Ciliates are microbial eukaryotes with distinct somatic and germline genomes. Postzygotic development involves extensive remodeling of the germline genome to form somatic chromosomes. Ciliates therefore offer a valuable model for studying the architecture and evolution of programed genome rearrangements. Current studies usually focus on a few model species, where rearrangement features are annotated by aligning reference germline and somatic genomes. Although many high-quality somatic genomes have been assembled, a high-quality germline genome assembly is difficult to obtain due to its smaller DNA content and abundance of repetitive sequences. To overcome these hurdles, we propose a new pipeline, SIGAR (Split-read Inference of Genome Architecture and Rearrangements) to infer germline genome architecture and rearrangement features without a germline genome assembly, requiring only short DNA sequencing reads. As a proof of principle, 93% of rearrangement junctions identified by SIGAR in the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax were validated by the existing germline assembly. We then applied SIGAR to six diverse ciliate species without germline genome assemblies, including Ichthyophthirius multifilii, a fish pathogen. Despite the high level of somatic DNA contamination in each sample, SIGAR successfully inferred rearrangement junctions, short eliminated sequences, and potential scrambled genes in each species. This pipeline enables pilot surveys or exploration of DNA rearrangements in species with limited DNA material access, thereby providing new insights into the evolution of chromosome rearrangements.",

        "Abstract": "Whole-genome shotgun sequencing, which stitches together millions of short sequencing reads into a single genome, ushered in the era of modern genomics and led to a rapid expansion of the number of genome sequences available. Nevertheless, assembly of short reads remains difficult, resulting in fragmented genome sequences. Ultimately, only a sequencing technology capable of capturing complete chromosomes in a single run could resolve all ambiguities. Even \"third generation\" sequencing technologies produce reads far shorter than most eukaryotic chromosomes. However, the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax has a somatic genome with thousands of chromosomes averaging only 3.2 kbp, making it an ideal candidate for exploring the benefits of sequencing whole chromosomes without assembly.",

        "Abstract": "Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is both a driver of eukaryotic genome instability and a product of programmed genome rearrangements, but its extent had not been surveyed in Oxytricha, a ciliate with elaborate DNA elimination and translocation during development. Here, we captured rearrangement-specific circular DNA molecules across the genome to gain insight into its processes of programmed genome rearrangement. We recovered thousands of circularly excised Tc1/mariner-type transposable elements and high confidence non-repetitive germline-limited loci. We verified their bona fide circular topology using circular DNA deep-sequencing, 2D gel electrophoresis and inverse polymerase chain reaction. In contrast to the precise circular excision of transposable elements, we report widespread heterogeneity in the circular excision of non-repetitive germline-limited loci. We also demonstrate that circular DNAs are transcribed in Oxytricha, producing rearrangement-specific long non-coding RNAs. The programmed formation of thousands of eccDNA molecules makes Oxytricha a model system for studying nucleic acid topology. It also suggests involvement of eccDNA in programmed genome rearrangement.",

        "Abstract": "DNA N6-adenine methylation (6mA) has recently been described in diverse eukaryotes, spanning unicellular organisms to metazoa. Here, we report a DNA 6mA methyltransferase complex in ciliates, termed MTA1c. It consists of two MT-A70 proteins and two homeobox-like DNA-binding proteins and specifically methylates dsDNA. Disruption of the catalytic subunit, MTA1, in the ciliate Oxytricha leads to genome-wide loss of 6mA and abolishment of the consensus ApT dimethylated motif. Mutants fail to complete the sexual cycle, which normally coincides with peak MTA1 expression. We investigate the impact of 6mA on nucleosome occupancy in\u00a0vitro by reconstructing complete, full-length Oxytricha chromosomes harboring 6mA in native or ectopic positions. We show that 6mA directly disfavors nucleosomes in\u00a0vitro in a local, quantitative manner, independent of DNA sequence. Furthermore, the chromatin remodeler ACF can overcome this effect. Our study identifies a diverged DNA N6-adenine methyltransferase and defines the role of 6mA in chromatin organization.",

        "Title": "Recurring patterns among scrambled genes in the encrypted genome of the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax.",
        "Abstract": "Some genera of ciliates, such as Oxytricha and Stylonychia, undergo massive genome reorganization during development and provide model organisms to study DNA rearrangement. A common feature of these ciliates is the presence of two types of nuclei: a germline micronucleus and a transcriptionally-active somatic macronucleus containing over 16,000 gene sized \"nano-chromosomes\". During conjugation the old parental macronucleus disintegrates and a new macronucleus forms from a copy of the zygotic micronucleus. During this process, macronuclear chromosomes assemble through DNA processing events that delete 90-98% of the DNA content of the micronucleus. This includes the deletion of noncoding DNA segments that interrupt precursor DNA regions in the micronucleus, as well as transposons and other germline-limited DNA. Each macronuclear locus may be present in the micronucleus as several nonconsecutive, permuted, and/or inverted DNA segments. Here we investigate the genome-wide range of scrambled gene architectures that describe all precursor-product relationships in Oxytricha trifallax, the first completely sequenced scrambled genome. We find that five general, recurrent patterns in the sets of scrambled micronuclear precursor pieces can describe over 80% of Oxytricha's scrambled genes. These include instances of translocations and inversions, and other specific patterns characterized by alternating stretches of consecutive odd and even DNA segments. Moreover, we find that iterating patterns of alternating odd-even segments up to four times can describe over 96% of the scrambled precursor loci. Recurrence of these highly structured genetic architectures within scrambled genes presumably reflects recurrent evolutionary events that gave rise to over 3000 of scrambled loci in the germline genome.",

        "Abstract": "Chromosomal fusions are common in normal and cancer cells and can produce aberrant gene products that promote transformation. The mechanisms driving these fusions are poorly understood, but recurrent fusions are widespread. This suggests an underlying mechanism, and some authors have proposed a possible role for RNA in this process. The unicellular eukaryote Oxytricha trifallax displays an exorbitant capacity for natural genome editing, when it rewrites its germline genome to form a somatic epigenome. This developmental process provides a powerful model system to directly test the influence of small noncoding RNAs on chromosome fusion events during somatic differentiation. Here we show that small RNAs are capable of inducing chromosome fusions in 4 distinct cases (out of 4 tested), including one fusion of 3 chromosomes. We further show that these RNA-mediated chromosome fusions are heritable over multiple sexual generations and that transmission of the acquired fusion is associated with endogenous production of novel piRNA molecules that target the fused junction. We also demonstrate the capacity of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) to induce chromosome fusion of 2 distal germline loci. These results underscore the ability of short-lived, aberrant RNAs to act as drivers of chromosome fusion events that can be stably transmitted to future generations.",

        "Abstract": "Transposable elements are a major player contributing to genetic variation and shaping genome evolution. Multiple independent transposon domestication events have occurred in ciliates, recruiting transposases to key roles in cellular processes. In the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax, the telomere-bearing elements (TBE), a Tc1/mariner transposon, occupy a significant portion of the germline genome and are involved in programmed genome rearrangements that produce a transcriptionally active somatic nucleus from a copy of the germline nucleus during development.",

        "Title": "The TIM Barrel Architecture Facilitated the Early Evolution of Protein-Mediated Metabolism.",
        "Abstract": "The triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel protein fold is a structurally repetitive architecture that is present in approximately 10% of all enzymes. It is generally assumed that this ubiquity in modern proteomes reflects an essential historical role in early protein-mediated metabolism. Here, we provide quantitative and comparative analyses to support several hypotheses about the early importance of the TIM barrel architecture. An information theoretical analysis of protein structures supports the hypothesis that the TIM barrel architecture could arise more easily by duplication and recombination compared to other mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 structures. We show that TIM barrel enzymes corresponding to the most taxonomically broad superfamilies also have the broadest range of functions, often aided by metal and nucleotide-derived cofactors that are thought to reflect an earlier stage of metabolic evolution. By comparison to other putatively ancient protein architectures, we find that the functional diversity of TIM barrel proteins cannot be explained simply by their antiquity. Instead, the breadth of TIM barrel functions can be explained, in part, by the incorporation of a broad range of cofactors, a trend that does not appear to be shared by proteins in general. These results support the hypothesis that the simple and functionally general TIM barrel architecture may have arisen early in the evolution of protein biosynthesis and provided an ideal scaffold to facilitate the metabolic transition from ribozymes, peptides, and geochemical catalysts to modern protein enzymes.",

        "Title": "The Physarum polycephalum Genome Reveals Extensive Use of Prokaryotic Two-Component and Metazoan-Type Tyrosine Kinase Signaling.",
        "Abstract": "Physarum polycephalum is a well-studied microbial eukaryote with unique experimental attributes relative to other experimental model organisms. It has a sophisticated life cycle with several distinct stages including amoebal, flagellated, and plasmodial cells. It is unusual in switching between open and closed mitosis according to specific life-cycle stages. Here we present the analysis of the genome of this enigmatic and important model organism and compare it with closely related species. The genome is littered with simple and complex repeats and the coding regions are frequently interrupted by introns with a mean size of 100 bases. Complemented with extensive transcriptome data, we define approximately 31,000 gene loci, providing unexpected insights into early eukaryote evolution. We describe extensive use of histidine kinase-based two-component systems and tyrosine kinase signaling, the presence of bacterial and plant type photoreceptors (phytochromes, cryptochrome, and phototropin) and of plant-type pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, as well as metabolic pathways, and a cell cycle control system typically found in more complex eukaryotes. Our analysis characterizes P. polycephalum as a prototypical eukaryote with features attributed to the last common ancestor of Amorphea, that is, the Amoebozoa and Opisthokonts. Specifically, the presence of tyrosine kinases in Acanthamoeba and Physarum as representatives of two distantly related subdivisions of Amoebozoa argues against the later emergence of tyrosine kinase signaling in the opisthokont lineage and also against the acquisition by horizontal gene transfer.",

        "Abstract": "Programmed genome rearrangements in the unicellular eukaryote Oxytricha trifallax produce a transcriptionally active somatic nucleus from a copy of its germline nucleus during development. This process eliminates noncoding sequences that interrupt coding regions in the germline genome, and joins over 225,000 remaining DNA segments, some of which require inversion or complex permutation to build functional genes. This dynamic genomic organization permits some single DNA segments in the germline to contribute to multiple, distinct somatic genes via alternative processing. Like alternative mRNA splicing, the combinatorial assembly of DNA segments contributes to genetic variation and facilitates the evolution of new genes. In this study, we use comparative genomic analysis to demonstrate that the emergence of alternative DNA splicing is associated with the origin of new genes. Short duplications give rise to alternative gene segments that are spliced to the shared gene segments. Alternative gene segments evolve faster than shared, constitutive segments. Genes with shared segments frequently have different expression profiles, permitting functional divergence. This study reports alternative DNA splicing as a mechanism of new gene origination, illustrating how the process of programmed genome rearrangement gives rise to evolutionary innovation.",

        "Abstract": "A conserved hallmark of eukaryotic chromatin architecture is the distinctive array of well-positioned nucleosomes downstream from transcription start sites (TSS). Recent studies indicate that trans-acting factors establish this stereotypical array. Here, we present the first genome-wide in vitro and in vivo nucleosome maps for the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. In contrast with previous studies in yeast, we find that the stereotypical nucleosome array is preserved in the in vitro reconstituted map, which is governed only by the DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes. Remarkably, this average in vitro pattern arises from the presence of subsets of nucleosomes, rather than the whole array, in individual Tetrahymena genes. Variation in GC content contributes to the positioning of these sequence-directed nucleosomes and affects codon usage and amino acid composition in genes. Given that the AT-rich Tetrahymena genome is intrinsically unfavorable for nucleosome formation, we propose that these \"seed\" nucleosomes--together with trans-acting factors--may facilitate the establishment of nucleosome arrays within genes in vivo, while minimizing changes to the underlying coding sequences.",

        "Abstract": "The ciliate Oxytricha is a microbial eukaryote with two genomes, one of which experiences extensive genome remodeling during development. Each round of conjugation initiates a cascade of events that construct a transcriptionally active somatic genome from a scrambled germline genome, with considerable help from both long and small noncoding RNAs. This process of genome remodeling entails massive DNA deletion and reshuffling of remaining DNA segments to form functional genes from their interrupted and scrambled germline precursors. The use of Oxytricha as a model system provides an opportunity to study an exaggerated form of programmed genome rearrangement. Furthermore, studying the mechanisms that maintain nuclear dimorphism and mediate genome rearrangement has demonstrated a surprising plasticity and diversity of noncoding RNA pathways, with new roles that go beyond conventional gene silencing. Another aspect of ciliate genetics is their unorthodox patterns of RNA-mediated, epigenetic inheritance that rival Mendelian inheritance. This review takes the reader through the key experiments in a model eukaryote that led to fundamental discoveries in RNA biology and pushes the biological limits of DNA processing.",

This elaborate, RNA-mediated pathway eliminates noncoding DNA sequences that interrupt gene loci and reorganizes the remaining fragments by inversions and permutations to produce functional genes. Here, we report the Oxytricha germline genome and compare it to the somatic genome to present a global view of its massive scale of genome rearrangements. The remarkably encrypted genome architecture contains >3,500 scrambled genes, as well as >800 predicted germline-limited genes expressed, and some posttranslationally modified, during genome rearrangements. Gene segments for different somatic loci often interweave with each other. Single gene segments can contribute to multiple, distinct somatic loci. Terminal precursor segments from neighboring somatic loci map extremely close to each other, often overlapping. This genome assembly provides a draft of a scrambled genome and a powerful model for studies of genome rearrangement.",

        "Abstract": "The RNA polymerase II (Pol-II) holoenzyme, responsible for messenger RNA production, typically consists of 10-12 subunits. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that maternally deposited, long, noncoding, template RNAs are essential for programmed genome rearrangements in the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax. Here we show that such RNAs are bidirectionally transcribed and transported to the zygotic nucleus. The gene encoding the second-largest subunit of Pol-II, Rpb2, has undergone gene duplication, and the two paralogs, Rpb2-a and -b, display different expression patterns. Immunoprecipitation of double-stranded RNAs identified an association with Rpb2-a. Through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we show that Rpb2-a in early zygotes appears surprisingly unassociated with other Pol II subunits. A partial loss of function of Rpb2-a leads to an increase in expression of transposons and other germline-limited satellite repeats. We propose that evolutionary divergence of the Rpb2 paralogs has led to acquisition of transcription-independent functions during sexual reproduction that may contribute to the negative regulation of germline gene expression.",

        "Title": "Transposon domestication versus mutualism in ciliate genome rearrangements.",
        "Abstract": "Ciliated protists rearrange their genomes dramatically during nuclear development via chromosome fragmentation and DNA deletion to produce a trimmer and highly reorganized somatic genome. The deleted portion of the genome includes potentially active transposons or transposon-like sequences that reside in the germline. Three independent studies recently showed that transposase proteins of the DDE/DDD superfamily are indispensible for DNA processing in three distantly related ciliates. In the spirotrich Oxytricha trifallax, high copy-number germline-limited transposons mediate their own excision from the somatic genome but also contribute to programmed genome rearrangement through a remarkable transposon mutualism with the host. By contrast, the genomes of two oligohymenophorean ciliates, Tetrahymena thermophila and Paramecium tetraurelia, encode homologous PiggyBac-like transposases as single-copy genes in both their germline and somatic genomes. These domesticated transposases are essential for deletion of thousands of different internal sequences in these species. This review contrasts the events underlying somatic genome reduction in three different ciliates and considers their evolutionary origins and the relationships among their distinct mechanisms for genome remodeling.",

        "Title": "The Oxytricha trifallax macronuclear genome: a complex eukaryotic genome with 16,000 tiny chromosomes.",
        "Abstract": "The macronuclear genome of the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax displays an extreme and unique eukaryotic genome architecture with extensive genomic variation. During sexual genome development, the expressed, somatic macronuclear genome is whittled down to the genic portion of a small fraction (\u223c5%) of its precursor \"silent\" germline micronuclear genome by a process of \"unscrambling\" and fragmentation. The tiny macronuclear \"nanochromosomes\" typically encode single, protein-coding genes (a small portion, 10%, encode 2-8 genes), have minimal noncoding regions, and are differentially amplified to an average of \u223c2,000 copies. We report the high-quality genome assembly of \u223c16,000 complete nanochromosomes (\u223c50 Mb haploid genome size) that vary from 469 bp to 66 kb long (mean \u223c3.2 kb) and encode \u223c18,500 genes. Alternative DNA fragmentation processes \u223c10% of the nanochromosomes into multiple isoforms that usually encode complete genes. Nucleotide diversity in the macronucleus is very high (SNP heterozygosity is \u223c4.0%), suggesting that Oxytricha trifallax may have one of the largest known effective population sizes of eukaryotes. Comparison to other ciliates with nonscrambled genomes and long macronuclear chromosomes (on the order of 100 kb) suggests several candidate proteins that could be involved in genome rearrangement, including domesticated MULE and IS1595-like DDE transposases. The assembly of the highly fragmented Oxytricha macronuclear genome is the first completed genome with such an unusual architecture. This genome sequence provides tantalizing glimpses into novel molecular biology and evolution. For example, Oxytricha maintains tens of millions of telomeres per cell and has also evolved an intriguing expansion of telomere end-binding proteins. In conjunction with the micronuclear genome in progress, the O. trifallax macronuclear genome will provide an invaluable resource for investigating programmed genome rearrangements, complementing studies of rearrangements arising during evolution and disease.",

Here we report the computational detection of an interchromosomal RNA fusion between ZC3HAV1L and CHMP1A from RNA-seq data of normal human mammary epithelial cells, and experimental confirmation of the chimeric transcript in multiple human cells and tissues. Our experimental characterization also detected three variants of the ZC3HAV1L-CHMP1A chimeric RNA, suggesting that these genes are involved in complex splicing. The fusion sequence at the novel exon-exon boundary, and the absence of corresponding DNA rearrangement suggest that this chimeric RNA is likely produced by trans-splicing in human cells.",

        "Abstract": "Genome duality in ciliated protozoa offers a unique system to showcase their epigenome as a model of inheritance. In Oxytricha, the somatic genome is responsible for vegetative growth, whereas the germline contributes DNA to the next sexual generation. Somatic nuclear development removes all transposons and other so-called \"junk\" DNA, which comprise ~95% of the germline. We demonstrate that Piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) from the maternal nucleus can specify genomic regions for retention in this process. Oxytricha piRNAs map primarily to the somatic genome, representing the ~5% of the germline that is retained. Furthermore, injection of synthetic piRNAs corresponding to normally deleted regions leads to their retention in later generations. Our findings highlight small RNAs as powerful transgenerational carriers of epigenetic information for genome programming.",

        "Abstract": "Organisms represented by the root of the universal evolutionary tree were most likely complex cells with a sophisticated protein translation system and a DNA genome encoding hundreds of genes. The growth of bioinformatics data from taxonomically diverse organisms has made it possible to infer the likely properties of early life in greater detail. Here we present LUCApedia, (http://eeb.princeton.edu/lucapedia), a unified framework for simultaneously evaluating multiple data sets related to the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) and its predecessors. This unification is achieved by mapping eleven such data sets onto UniProt, KEGG and BioCyc IDs. LUCApedia may be used to rapidly acquire evidence that a certain gene or set of genes is ancient, to examine the early evolution of metabolic pathways, or to test specific hypotheses related to ancient life by corroborating them against the rest of the database.",

Current gaps in our conceptual framework of early genetic systems make it difficult to imagine how a stable RNA genome may have functioned and how the transition to a DNA genome could have taken place. Here we use the single-celled ciliate, Oxytricha, as an analog to some of the genetic and genomic traits that may have been present in organisms before and during the establishment of a DNA genome. Oxytricha and its close relatives have a unique genome architecture involving two differentiated nuclei, one of which encodes the genome on small, linear nanochromosomes. While its unique genomic characteristics are relatively modern, some physiological processes related to the genomes and nuclei of Oxytricha may exemplify primitive states of the developing genetic system.",

        "Abstract": "Oxytricha trifallax - an established model organism for studying genome rearrangements, chromosome structure, scrambled genes, RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance, and other phenomena - has been the subject of a nomenclature controversy for several years. Originally isolated as a sibling species of O. fallax, O. trifallax was reclassified in 1999 as Sterkiella histriomuscorum, a previously identified species, based on morphological similarity. The proper identification of O. trifallax is crucial to resolve in order to prevent confusion in both the comparative genomics and the general scientific communities. We analyzed nine conserved nuclear gene sequences between the two given species and several related ciliates. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that O. trifallax and a bona fide S. histriomuscorum have accumulated significant evolutionary divergence from each other relative to other ciliates such that they should be unequivocally classified as separate species. We also describe the original isolation of O. trifallax, including its comparison to O. fallax, and we provide criteria to identify future isolates of O. trifallax.",

        "Abstract": "The Oxytricha trifallax mitochondrial genome contains the largest sequenced ciliate mitochondrial chromosome (~70 kb) plus a ~5-kb linear plasmid bearing mitochondrial telomeres. We identify two new ciliate split genes (rps3 and nad2) as well as four new mitochondrial genes (ribosomal small subunit protein genes: rps- 2, 7, 8, 10), previously undetected in ciliates due to their extreme divergence. The increased size of the Oxytricha mitochondrial genome relative to other ciliates is primarily a consequence of terminal expansions, rather than the retention of ancestral mitochondrial genes. Successive segmental duplications, visible in one of the two Oxytricha mitochondrial subterminal regions, appear to have contributed to the genome expansion. Consistent with pseudogene formation and decay, the subtermini possess shorter, more loosely packed open reading frames than the remainder of the genome. The mitochondrial plasmid shares a 251-bp region with 82% identity to the mitochondrial chromosome, suggesting that it most likely integrated into the chromosome at least once. This region on the chromosome is also close to the end of the most terminal member of a series of duplications, hinting at a possible association between the plasmid and the duplications. The presence of mitochondrial telomeres on the mitochondrial plasmid suggests that such plasmids may be a vehicle for lateral transfer of telomeric sequences between mitochondrial genomes. We conjecture that the extreme divergence observed in ciliate mitochondrial genomes may be due, in part, to repeated invasions by relatively error-prone DNA polymerase-bearing mobile elements.",

        "Abstract": "In a process similar to exon splicing, ciliates use DNA splicing to produce a new somatic macronuclear genome from their germline micronuclear genome after sexual reproduction. This extra layer of DNA rearrangement permits novel mechanisms to create genetic complexity during both evolution and development. Here we describe a chimeric macronuclear chromosome in Oxytricha trifallax constructed from two smaller macronuclear chromosomes. To determine how the chimera was generated, we cloned and sequenced the corresponding germline loci. The chimera derives from a novel locus in the micronucleus that arose by partial duplication of the loci for the two smaller chromosomes. This suggests that an exon shuffling-like process, which we call MDS shuffling, enables ciliates to generate novel genetic material and gene products using different combinations of genomic DNA segments.",

        "Abstract": "RNA, normally thought of as a conduit in gene expression, has a novel mode of action in ciliated protozoa. Maternal RNA templates provide both an organizing guide for DNA rearrangements and a template that can transport somatic mutations to the next generation. This opportunity for RNA-mediated genome rearrangement and DNA repair is profound in the ciliate Oxytricha, which deletes 95% of its germline genome during development in a process that severely fragments its chromosomes and then sorts and reorders the hundreds of thousands of pieces remaining. Oxytricha's somatic nuclear genome is therefore an epigenome formed through RNA templates and signals arising from the previous generation. Furthermore, this mechanism of RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance can function across multiple generations, and the discovery of maternal template RNA molecules has revealed new biological roles for RNA and has hinted at the power of RNA molecules to sculpt genomic information in cells.",

        "Abstract": "We took advantage of the unusual genomic organization of the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax to screen for eukaryotic non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes. Ciliates have two types of nuclei: a germ line micronucleus that is usually transcriptionally inactive, and a somatic macronucleus that contains a reduced, fragmented and rearranged genome that expresses all genes required for growth and asexual reproduction. In some ciliates including Oxytricha, the macronuclear genome is particularly extreme, consisting of thousands of tiny 'nanochromosomes', each of which usually contains only a single gene. Because the organism itself identifies and isolates most of its genes on single-gene nanochromosomes, nanochromosome structure could facilitate the discovery of unusual genes or gene classes, such as ncRNA genes. Using a draft Oxytricha genome assembly and a custom-written protein-coding genefinding program, we identified a subset of nanochromosomes that lack any detectable protein-coding gene, thereby strongly enriching for nanochromosomes that carry ncRNA genes. We found only a small proportion of non-coding nanochromosomes, suggesting that Oxytricha has few independent ncRNA genes besides homologs of already known RNAs. Other than new members of known ncRNA classes including C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs, our screen identified one new family of small RNA genes, named the Arisong RNAs, which share some of the features of small nuclear RNAs.",

        "Abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that parentally supplied RNA plays crucial roles during eukaryotic development. This epigenetic contribution may regulate gene expression from the earliest stages. Although present in a variety of eukaryotes, maternally inherited characters are especially prominent in ciliated protozoa, in which parental noncoding RNA molecules instruct whole-genome reorganization. This includes removal of nearly all noncoding DNA and sorting the remaining fragments, producing extremely gene-rich somatic genomes. Chromosome fragmentation and extensive replication produce variable DNA copy numbers in the somatic genome. Understanding the forces that drive and regulate copy number change is fundamental. We show that RNA molecules present in parental cells during sexual reproduction can regulate chromosome copy number in the developing nucleus of the ciliate Oxytricha. Experimentally induced changes in RNA abundance can both increase and decrease the levels of corresponding DNA molecules in progeny, demonstrating epigenetic inheritance of chromosome copy number. These results suggest that maternal RNA, in addition to controlling gene expression or DNA processing, can also program DNA amplification levels.",

        "Abstract": "2009 marks not only the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth but also publication of the first scientific evolutionary theory, Lamarck's Philosophie Zoologique. While Lamarck embraced the notion of the inheritance of acquired characters, he did not invent it (Burkhardt, 1984). New phenomena discovered recently offer molecular pathways for the transmission of several acquired characters. Ciliates have long provided model systems to study phenomena that bypass traditional modes of inheritance. RNA, normally thought of as a conduit in gene expression, displays a novel mode of action in ciliated protozoa. For example, maternal RNA templates provide both an organizing guide for DNA rearrangements in Oxytricha and a template that can transmit spontaneous mutations that may arise during somatic growth to the next generation, providing two such mechanisms of so-called Lamarckian inheritance. This suggests that the somatic ciliate genome is really an 'epigenome', formed through templates and signals arising from the previous generation. This review will discuss these new biological roles for RNA, including non-coding 'template' RNA molecules. The evolutionary consequences of viable mechanisms in ciliates to transmit acquired characters may create an additional store of heritable variation that contributes to the cosmopolitan success of this diverse lineage of microbial eukaryotes.",

        "Abstract": "Despite comprising much of the eukaryotic genome, few transposons are active, and they usually confer no benefit to the host. Through an exaggerated process of genome rearrangement, Oxytricha trifallax destroys 95% of its germline genome during development. This includes the elimination of all transposon DNA. We show that germline-limited transposase genes play key roles in this process of genome-wide DNA excision, which suggests that transposases function in large eukaryotic genomes containing thousands of active transposons. We show that transposase gene expression occurs during germline-soma differentiation and that silencing of transposase by RNA interference leads to abnormal DNA rearrangement in the offspring. This study suggests a new important role in Oxytricha for this large portion of genomic DNA that was previously thought of as junk.",

Development of the somatic macronucleus in some ciliates presents an extreme case, involving excision of internal eliminated sequences (IESs) that interrupt coding DNA segments (macronuclear destined sequences, MDSs), as well as removal of transposon-like elements and extensive genome fragmentation, leading to 98% genome reduction in Stylonychia lemnae. Approximately 20-30% of the genes are estimated to be scrambled in the germline micronucleus, with coding segment order permuted and present in either orientation on micronuclear chromosomes. Massive genome rearrangements are therefore critical for development.",

        "Abstract": "Genome-wide DNA rearrangements occur in many eukaryotes but are most exaggerated in ciliates, making them ideal model systems for epigenetic phenomena. During development of the somatic macronucleus, Oxytricha trifallax destroys 95% of its germ line, severely fragmenting its chromosomes, and then unscrambles hundreds of thousands of remaining fragments by permutation or inversion. Here we demonstrate that DNA or RNA templates can orchestrate these genome rearrangements in Oxytricha, supporting an epigenetic model for sequence-dependent comparison between germline and somatic genomes. A complete RNA cache of the maternal somatic genome may be available at a specific stage during development to provide a template for correct and precise DNA rearrangement. We show the existence of maternal RNA templates that could guide DNA assembly, and that disruption of specific RNA molecules disables rearrangement of the corresponding gene. Injection of artificial templates reprogrammes the DNA rearrangement pathway, suggesting that RNA molecules guide genome rearrangement.",

        "Abstract": "We propose molecular models for homologous DNA recombination events that are guided by either double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) templates. The models are applied to explain DNA rearrangements in some groups of ciliates, such as Stylonychia or Oxytricha, where extensive gene rearrangement occurs during differentiation of a somatic macronucleus from a germline micronucleus. We describe a model for RNA template guided DNA recombination, such that the template serves as a catalyst that remains unchanged after DNA recombination. This recombination can be seen as topological braiding of the DNA, with the template-guided alignment proceeding through DNA branch migration. We show that a virtual knot diagram can provide a physical representation of the DNA at the time of recombination. Schematically, the braiding process can be represented as a crossing in the virtual knot diagram. The homologous recombination corresponds to removal of the crossings in the knot diagram (called smoothing). We show that if all recombinations are performed at the same time (i.e., simultaneous smoothings of the crossings) then one of the resulting DNA molecules will always contain all of the gene segments in their correct, linear order, which produces the mature DNA sequence.",

        "Abstract": "We present BLAST on Orthologous groups (BLASTO), a modified BLAST tool for searching orthologous group data. It treats each orthologous group as a unit and outputs a ranked list of orthologous groups instead of single sequences. By filtering out redundancy and putative paralogs, sequence comparisons to orthologous groups, instead of to single sequences in the database, can improve both functional prediction and phylogenetic inference. BLASTO computes the significance score of each orthologous group based on the individual BLAST hits in the orthologous group, using the number of taxa in the group as an optional weight. This allows users to control the species diversity of the orthologous groups. BLASTO incorporates the best-known multispecies ortholog databases, including NCBI Clusters of Orthologous Group, NCBI euKaryotic Orthologous Group database, OrthoMCL, MultiParanoid and TIGR Eukaryotic Gene Orthologues database, and offers a useful platform to integrate orthology information into functional inference and evolutionary studies of individual sequences.

        "Abstract": "Adenosine (A) to inosine (I) RNA editing occurs widely in the human transcriptome, and a large proportion of editing sites are within untranslated regions (UTRs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs), an abundant class of regulatory genes, specify the expression of a large number of target genes by pairing to their 3' UTRs. To study the interplay between these two post-transcriptional events, we developed a computational pipeline to integrate sequence and miRNA tissue specificity data. The results show that some A-to-I RNA editing positions have a potential to block the miRNA:target recognition, although further computational simulation suggests that RNA editing tends to avoid miRNA target sites in general. We propose that a small proportion of RNA editing events may provide an additional layer of control on miRNA-mediated repression. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the functional effect of these special RNA editing events.",

Because operons account for about 15% of the genes in C. elegans, this lower duplication frequency might place a large constraint on the plasticity of the genome.

        "Title": "Conserved linkage of two genes on the same macronuclear chromosome in spirotrichous ciliates.",
        "Abstract": "Macronuclear chromosomes of spirotrichous ciliates are mainly \"nanochromosomes\" containing only a single gene. We identified a two-gene chromosome in the spirotrich Sterkiella histriomuscorum (formerly Oxytricha trifallax) which, unlike other characterized two-gene molecules, contains reading frames oriented tail to tail. These are homologs of ribosomal protein L29 (RPL29) and cyclophilin. We found that both genes are transcribed, with their polyadenylation sites on opposite strands separated by only 135 bp. Furthermore, both genes in S. histriomuscorum are present only on one macronuclear chromosome and do not occur alone or linked to other genes. The corresponding micronuclear locus is fragmented into three nonscrambled gene segments (MDSs), separated by two noncoding segments (IESs). We also found that these two genes are linked on a macronuclear chromosome, similarly arranged tail to tail, in the three spirotrichs Stylonychia lemnae, Uroleptus sp., and Holosticha sp.. In addition, single-gene macronuclear chromosomes containing only the RPL29 gene were detected in the earlier diverged Holosticha and Uroleptus. These observations suggest a possible evolutionary trend towards loss of chromosomal breakage between these two genes. This study is the first to examine gene linkage in the macronucleus of several spirotrichs and may provide insight into the evolution of multi-gene macronuclear chromosomes and chromosomal fragmentation in spirotrichs.",

        "Title": "Evolution of programmed DNA rearrangements in a scrambled gene.",
        "Abstract": "Gene unscrambling in spirotrichous ciliates involves massive genome-wide DNA deletion and rearrangement events during development. During each sexual cycle, the somatic nucleus (macronucleus) regenerates from the germ line nucleus (micronucleus). Development of the polyploid somatic genome requires programmed DNA deletion of micronuclear-limited intragenic noncoding sequences and permutation and amplification of the protein-coding regions. Recent studies suggest that, despite novel insertions of endogenous transposon or foreign DNA into the germ line genome, ciliates possess a whole-genome surveillance system that guides the recapitulation of a functional somatic genome. This renders the germ line genome an extremely dynamic structure over evolutionary time. Here we describe the germ line and somatic architectures of the gene encoding alpha-telomere-binding protein in three early-diverging species (Holosticha sp., Uroleptus sp., and Paraurostyla weissei) and trace the natural history of DNA rearrangements in this gene in six species, including three previously studied oxytrichids. Comparisons of homologous coding regions between earlier and later diverging species provide evidence for fusion of scrambled germ line fragments as small as 24 bp during evolution, as well as simultaneous fragmentation and scrambling of the germ line locus and shifting of the boundaries between coding and noncoding DNA, leading to distinct gene architectures in each species. We infer an evolutionary recombination pathway that passes through identified intermediate species and gives rise to the observed patterns in all known species, capitalizing on their unique DNA rearrangement machinery and germ line flexibility.",

        "Abstract": "Alternative splicing is a major mechanism for gene product regulation in many multicellular organisms. By using different exon combinations, some coding regions can encode amino acids in multiple reading frames in different transcripts. Here we performed a systematic search through a set of high-quality human transcripts and show that approximately 7% of alternatively spliced genes contain dual (multiple) coding regions. By using a conservative criterion, we found that in these regions most secondary reading frames evolved recently in mammals, and a significant proportion of them may be specific to primates. Based on the presence of in-frame stop codons in orthologous sequences in other animals, we further classified ancestral and derived reading frames in these regions. Our results indicated that ancestral reading frames are usually under stronger selection than are derived reading frames. Ancestral reading frames mainly influence the coding properties of these dual coding regions. Compared with coding regions of the whole genome, ancestral reading frames largely maintain similar nucleotide composition at each codon position and amino acid usage, while derived reading frames are significantly different. Our results also indicated that prior to acquisition of a new reading frame, the suppression of in-frame stop codons in the ancestral state is mainly achieved by one-step transition substitutions at the first or second codon position. Finally, the selective forces imposed on these dual coding regions will also be discussed.",

        "Title": "A new scrambled gene in the ciliate Uroleptus.",
        "Abstract": "In the germline micronucleus of spirotrichous ciliates, the gene segments, or macronuclear destined sequences (MDSs), that give rise to the somatic macronucleus are interrupted by internal eliminated sequences (IESs). For some genes, the MDSs are not arranged sequentially, but rather are scrambled, in the micronucleus. Three scrambled genes have been extensively studied in many species: actin I, alpha-telomere binding protein, and DNA polymerase alpha. However, in the past decade, no new scrambled genes have been reported, and the prevalence of scrambled genes is still an important question. To screen for scrambled genes, we completely sequenced 11 macronuclear chromosomes in the spirotrich Uroleptus sp., and then pursued their micronuclear organization. This allowed us to identify new scrambled genes, which also display novel features. In this study we describe one of these newly discovered scrambled genes. This gene, tentatively named USG1 (Unknown Scrambled Gene 1), encodes a putative protein of 1016 aa. While the function of this protein product is not clear, dN/dS calculated from the two alleles suggests the encoded protein is under purifying selection. USG1 consists of 16 germline MDSs, of which 14 are located on one locus. The other locus, which is at least 3 kb away from the main locus, contains two scrambled MDSs separated by a nonscrambled IES. Curiously, one MDS and its outgoing (3') pointer (direct repeat) overlap intron splice sites, indicating that these DNA sequences may be under dual (or multiple) constraints. Our findings identify a new scrambled gene in the micronuclear genome of a spirotrichous ciliate, and suggest that even more complicated structures may be present.",

        "Abstract": "Some species of ciliates undergo massive DNA elimination and genome rearrangement to construct gene-sized \"chromosomes\" in their somatic nucleus. An example is the extensively scrambled DNA polymerase alpha gene that is broken into 48 pieces and distributed over two unlinked loci in Stylonychia. To understand the emergence of this complex phenomenon during evolution, we examined DNA polymerase alpha genes in several earlier diverging species, representing evolutionary intermediates. Mapping these data onto an evolutionary tree suggests that this gene became extensively fragmented and scrambled over evolutionary time through a series of steps, each leading to greater complexity. Our results also suggest a possible mechanism for intron loss by deletion of intron sequences as DNA during development of the somatic nucleus.",

        "Abstract": "The precise mechanism of stop codon recognition in translation termination is still unclear. A previously published study by Ivanov and colleagues proposed a new model for stop codon recognition in which 3-nucleotide Ter-anticodons within the loops of hairpin helices 69 (domain IV) and 89 (domain V) in large ribosomal subunit (LSU) rRNA recognize stop codons to terminate protein translation in eubacteria and certain organelles. We evaluated this model by extensive bioinformatic analysis of stop codons and their putative corresponding Ter-anticodons across a much wider range of species, and found many cases for which it cannot explain the stop codon usage without requiring the involvement of one or more of the eight possible noncomplementary base pairs. Involvement of such base pairs may not be structurally or thermodynamically damaging to the model. However, if, according to the model, Ter-anticodon interaction with stop codons occurs within the ribosomal A-site, the structural stringency which that site imposes on sense codon.tRNA anticodon interaction should also extend to stop codon.Ter-anticodon interactions. Moreover, with Ter-tRNA in place of an aminoacyl-tRNA, for each of the various Ter-anticodons there is a sense codon that can interact with it preferentially by complementary and wobble base-pairing. Both these considerations considerably weaken the arguments put forth previously.",

        "Abstract": "With rapidly increasing availability of three-dimensional structures, one major challenge for the post-genome era is to infer the functions of biological molecules based on their structural similarity. While quantitative studies of structural similarity between the same type of biological molecules (e.g., protein vs. protein) have been carried out intensively, the comparable study of structural similarity between different types of biological molecules (e.g., protein vs. RNA) remains unexplored. Here we have developed a new bioinformatics approach to quantitatively study the structural similarity between two different types of biopolymers--proteins and RNA--based on the spatial distribution of conserved elements. We applied it to two previously proposed tRNA-protein mimicry pairs whose functional relatedness between two molecules has been recently determined experimentally. Our method detected the biologically meaningful signals, which are consistent with experimental evidence.",

Domain 1 of the eRF1 protein has been implicated in stop codon recognition in a number of experimental studies. In order to further pinpoint the residues of this protein involved in stop codon recognition, we sequenced and compared eRF1 genes from a variety of ciliated protozoan species. We then performed a series of computational analyses to evaluate the conservation, accessibility, and structural environment of each amino acid located in domain 1. With this new dataset and methodology, we were able to identify eight specific amino acid sites important for stop codon recognition and also to propose a set of cooperative paired substitutions that may underlie stop codon reassignment. Our results are more consistent with current experimental data than previously described models.",

This gene, FSF1, encodes a putative fusion protein comprising an entire formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) homolog at one end and an S-formylglutathione hydrolase (SFGH) homolog at the other, two proteins that catalyze serial steps in the formaldehyde detoxification pathway. We confirmed the presence of the Oxytricha fusion gene in vivo and detected transcripts of the full-length fusion gene. A survey of other large-scale sequencing projects revealed a similar fusion protein in a distantly related ciliate, Tetrahymena thermophila, and a possible fusion of these two genes in the diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana, but in the reverse order, with the SFGH domain encoded upstream of the FALDH domain. Orthologs of these fusion proteins may be widespread within the ciliates and diatoms.",

We show that the telomeres in this species have a length of 20 nt, with minor deviations; there is no correlation between telomere lengths at the two ends of the molecule. A search for open reading frames revealed that the 3' and 5' untranslated regions are short, with a median length of approximately 130 nt, and that surprisingly there are no detectable differences between sequences upstream and downstream of genes. Our results confirm a previously reported purine bias in the first approximately 80 nucleotides of the subtelomeric regions, but with this larger data set we curiously detected a 10 bp periodicity in the bias; we relate this finding to the possible regulatory and structural functions these regions must serve. Palindromic sequences in opposing subtelomeric regions, although present in most sequences, are not statistically significant.",

        "Abstract": "We have discovered a three-gene macronuclear chromosome in a spirotrichous ciliate of the genus Holosticha. From 5' to 3', this chromosome contains genes encoding a member of the small G-protein family, an NAD kinase domain-containing protein, and the large subunit of DNA polymerase alpha. These three genes are separated by 16 and 38 nucleotides, respectively, and are oriented in the same direction in both the macronuclear and the micronuclear genomes. Probes made to these genes all hybridize to a single, strong band of size 7.0 kbp on a Southern Blot of Holosticha sp. macronuclear DNA, corresponding to the size of the three-gene macronuclear chromosome. Mapping the 5' and 3' ends of each of these genes using RACE showed that the transcripts of these genes exist as discrete mRNAs that are capped and polyadenylated. No nucleotides appeared to be added at the 5' ends of these transcripts, indicating that these transcripts are not generated by alternative or trans-splicing, but rather that each gene is transcribed from its own distinct promoter. Analysis of these linked genes may help define the evolutionary pressures leading to the extensive chromosome fragmentation seen in spirotrichous ciliates.",

We recently performed a pilot genome project for a member of this group, Oxytricha trifallax ( Sterkiella histriomuscorum), in which approximately 2000 nanochromosomes were cloned at random and end-sequenced. Here we describe the global properties of the coding regions predicted for these molecules, including nucleotide composition, codon usage, and intron properties. In identifying splice donor, acceptor and branch sites, we found that longer introns in Oxytricha have a stronger signal at the donor site than do smaller introns, as has been found for Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, despite the overall small size of the introns. A systematic search for multi-gene chromosomes identified 11 candidate nanochromosomes. We compare the results from this large dataset with those obtained from earlier studies and with statistics recorded from ciliates and other eukaryotes.",

These results suggest that complex RNAs could have evolved in freezing environments on the early earth and perhaps elsewhere.",

        "Abstract": "DNA polymerase alpha is the most highly scrambled gene known in stichotrichous ciliates. In its hereditary micronuclear form, it is broken into >40 pieces on two loci at least 3 kb apart. Scrambled genes must be reassembled through developmental DNA rearrangements to yield functioning macronuclear genes, but the mechanism and accuracy of this process are unknown. We describe the first analysis of DNA polymorphism in the macronuclear version of any scrambled gene. Six functional haplotypes obtained from five Eurasian strains of Stylonychia lemnae were highly polymorphic compared to Drosophila genes. Another incompletely unscrambled haplotype was interrupted by frameshift and nonsense mutations but contained more silent mutations than expected by allelic inactivation. In our sample, nucleotide diversity and recombination signals were unexpectedly high within a region encompassing the boundary of the two micronuclear loci. From this and other evidence we infer that both members of a long repeat at the ends of the loci provide alternative substrates for unscrambling in this region. Incongruent genealogies and recombination patterns were also consistent with separation of the two loci by a large genetic distance. Our results suggest that ciliate developmental DNA rearrangements may be more probabilistic and error prone than previously appreciated and constitute a potential source of macronuclear variation. From this perspective we introduce the nonsense-suppression hypothesis for the evolution of ciliate altered genetic codes. We also introduce methods and software to calculate the likelihood of hemizygosity in ciliate haplotype samples and to correct for multiple comparisons in sliding-window analyses of Tajima's D.",

        "Abstract": "RNA editing has a major impact on the genes and genomes that it modifies. Editing by insertion, deletion and base conversion exists in nuclear, mitochondrial and viral genomes throughout the eukaryotic lineage. Editing was first discovered in kinetoplastids, and recent work has resulted in the characterization of some components of the editing machinery. Two proteins with ligase activity have been identified in Trypanosoma brucei, and other proteins in the editosome complex are yielding to the probe of research. A second group of protists, myxomycetes, are unique in their use of four different types of editing within a single transcript. Phylogenetic analysis of editing in representative myxomycetes revealed a different history of the four types of editing in this lineage. Development of a soluble in vitro editing system has provided further support for the co-transcriptional nature of editing in Physarum polycephalum, and will certainly provide future opportunities for understanding this mysterious process.",
