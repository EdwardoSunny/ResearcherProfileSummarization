        "Title": "The Arabic Version of Compulsive Exercise Test among Saudi Population; Translation and Validation.",
        "Abstract": "Compulsive exercise is a condition characterized by uncontrollable exercise behaviour that may lead to severe and harmful physical and psychological consequences. Indeed, compulsive exercise is among the early symptoms of eating disorders that may affect different age groups. Globally and among Arab countries, compulsive exercise is common, while the screening methods used to assess compulsive exercise are limited. Thus, the Compulsive Exercise Test (CET) has emerged as a tool to assess cognitive, behavioural, and emotional factors related to compulsive exercise. The CET is a self-report, Likert-type scale comprising five distinct subscales. The increase in the CET scores is more likely associated with worsened pathology. Since the Arab countries lack such an assessment tool, we aimed to translate the CET into Arabic, validate the translated version, confirm the factor structures, and assess the internal consistency of the different subscales. Herein, we used the forward-backward translation method as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The overall validity index of the translated version showed a score higher than 0.78, while the scale-level content validity index based on the average calculating method (S-CVI/Ave) and the agreement method (S-CVI/UA) were 0.91 and 0.58, respectively. Moreover, we recruited 399 Arabs living in Saudi to measure the internal consistency, and the value of the substantive internal consistency with Cronbach's \u03b1 was 0.81. Subsequently, four of the Arabic-CET subscales had substantive internal consistency with Cronbach's \u03b1 values higher than or equal to 0.70. Furthermore, the exploratory factor analysis results supported the substantial use of the five-subscale model. Taken together, our study supports using the Arabic-CET version to measure exercise compulsiveness among Arabs.",

        "Abstract": "Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in key T cell genes can drive clinical pathologies and could be repurposed to improve cellular cancer immunotherapies. Here, we perform massively parallel base-editing screens to generate thousands of variants at gene loci annotated with known or potential clinical relevance. We discover a broad landscape of putative gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, including in PIK3CD and the gene encoding its regulatory subunit, PIK3R1, LCK, SOS1, AKT1 and RHOA. Base editing of PIK3CD and PIK3R1 variants in T cells with an engineered T cell receptor specific to a melanoma epitope or in different generations of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells demonstrates that discovered GOF variants, but not LOF or silent mutation controls, enhanced signaling, cytokine production and lysis of cognate melanoma and leukemia cell models, respectively. Additionally, we show that generations of CD19 CAR T cells engineered with PIK3CD GOF mutations demonstrate enhanced antigen-specific signaling, cytokine production and leukemia cell killing, including when benchmarked against other recent strategies.",

        "Abstract": "AlphaFold2 revolutionized structural biology with the ability to predict protein structures with exceptionally high accuracy. Its implementation, however, lacks the code and data required to train new models. These are necessary to (1) tackle new tasks, like protein-ligand complex structure prediction, (2) investigate the process by which the model learns and (3) assess the model's capacity to generalize to unseen regions of fold space. Here we report OpenFold, a fast, memory efficient and trainable implementation of AlphaFold2. We train OpenFold from scratch, matching the accuracy of AlphaFold2. Having established parity, we find that OpenFold is remarkably robust at generalizing even when the size and diversity of its training set is deliberately limited, including near-complete elisions of classes of secondary structure elements. By analyzing intermediate structures produced during training, we also gain insights into the hierarchical manner in which OpenFold learns to fold. In sum, our studies demonstrate the power and utility of OpenFold, which we believe will prove to be a crucial resource for the protein modeling community.",

        "Abstract": "Numerous cellular functions rely on protein-protein interactions. Efforts to comprehensively characterize them remain challenged however by the diversity of molecular recognition mechanisms employed within the proteome. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for tackling this problem by exploiting both experimental data and basic biophysical knowledge about protein interactions. Here, we review the growing ecosystem of deep learning methods for modeling protein interactions, highlighting the diversity of these biophysically informed models and their respective trade-offs. We discuss recent successes in using representation learning to capture complex features pertinent to predicting protein interactions and interaction sites, geometric deep learning to reason over protein structures and predict complex structures, and generative modeling to design de novo protein assemblies. We also outline some of the outstanding challenges and promising new directions. Opportunities abound to discover novel interactions, elucidate their physical mechanisms, and engineer binders to modulate their functions using deep learning and, ultimately, unravel how protein interactions orchestrate complex cellular behaviors.",

The present study aimed to investigate the association between general and oral health and nutritional status among older adults attending nutrition clinics at two main medical centers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A cross-section study was carried out among adult patients (\u226560 years) who attended a geriatric clinic or nutrition clinic at King Khalid University Hospital or King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh. A validated clinician's Mini Nutritional Assessment Short-Form (MNA-SF), Oral Health Impact Profile-5 (OHIP-5), and 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) were collected from each participant. A total of 261 participants with a mean age of 72.14 (\u00b18.97) years were recruited. Diabetes (71%) and hypertension (80%) were present in the majority of patients. The overall MNA-SF score was (10 \u00b1 3). Based on the categorization of the MNA-SF score, 65.9% were classified as malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. Participants with OHIP-5 scores higher than the median (>5) were more likely to be malnourished than those with scores at or lower than 5 (",

        "Abstract": "Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of proteins encode rich biological information and have been workhorses in bioinformatic methods for tasks like protein design and protein structure prediction for decades. Recent breakthroughs like AlphaFold2 that use transformers to attend directly over large quantities of raw MSAs have reaffirmed their importance. Generation of MSAs is highly computationally intensive, however, and no datasets comparable to those used to train AlphaFold2 have been made available to the research community, hindering progress in machine learning for proteins. To remedy this problem, we introduce OpenProteinSet, an open-source corpus of more than 16 million MSAs, associated structural homologs from the Protein Data Bank, and AlphaFold2 protein structure predictions. We have previously demonstrated the utility of OpenProteinSet by successfully retraining AlphaFold2 on it. We expect OpenProteinSet to be broadly useful as training and validation data for 1) diverse tasks focused on protein structure, function, and design and 2) large-scale multimodal machine learning research.",

Current predictors are often computationally intensive and difficult to scale, including recent deep learning models. We introduce Sequence UNET, a highly scalable deep learning architecture that classifies and predicts variant frequency from sequence alone using multi-scale representations from a fully convolutional compression/expansion architecture. It achieves comparable pathogenicity prediction to recent methods. We demonstrate scalability by analysing 8.3B variants in 904,134 proteins detected through large-scale proteomics. Sequence UNET runs on modest hardware with a simple Python package.",

        "Title": "Diagnostic Value of Inflammatory Markers in Elderly Arab Women with Sarcopenia.",
        "Abstract": "Several studies have found a correlation between inflammatory markers and sarcopenia; however, limited research has been conducted on the Arabic population. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the value of inflammatory parameters in Saudi elderly women with sarcopenia. In this cross-sectional study, 76 elderly Saudi women (>65 years) were stratified according to the presence (n = 26) or absence (n = 50) of sarcopenia, using the operational definition of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS). Demographics and clinical data were collected. Muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance were assessed using bioelectrical impedance, hand grip and timed-up-and-go (TUG) tests, respectively. Inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed using commercially available assays. Muscle mass and strength indicators were lower in the sarcopenia group (p-value < 0.05). Moreover, interleukin 6 (IL-6) was positively correlated with TUG (r = 0.48, p-value < 0.05), while CRP showed an inverse correlation with the right leg muscle (R-Leg-M) and a positive correlation with triceps skinfold (TSF) (r = \u22120.41, r = 0.42, respectively, p-values < 0.05). Additionally, TSF and R-Leg-M were independent predictors of CRP variation (R2 = 0.35; p < 0.01). Lastly, participants with a TNF-\u03b1 > 71.2 were five times more likely to have sarcopenia [(OR = 5.85), 95% CI: 1.07\u221232.08; p = 0.04]. In conclusion, elevated levels of TNF-\u03b1 are significantly associated with the risk of sarcopenia, while variations perceived in circulating CRP can be explained by changes in the muscle mass indices only among individuals with sarcopenia. The present findings, while promising, need further investigations on a larger scale to determine whether inflammatory markers hold any diagnostic value in assessing sarcopenia among elderly Arab women.",

        "Abstract": "AlphaFold2 and related computational systems predict protein structure using deep learning and co-evolutionary relationships encoded in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Despite high prediction accuracy achieved by these systems, challenges remain in (1) prediction of orphan and rapidly evolving proteins for which an MSA cannot be generated; (2) rapid exploration of designed structures; and (3) understanding the rules governing spontaneous polypeptide folding in solution. Here we report development of an end-to-end differentiable recurrent geometric network (RGN) that uses a protein language model (AminoBERT) to learn latent structural information from unaligned proteins.

        "Abstract": "The use of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in clinical settings is common. However, the value of BIA-based parameters in diagnosing metabolic syndrome (MetS) in children is under-investigated. Herein, we aimed to study the usefulness of BIA-indices in the diagnoses of MetS in 6-10-year-old girls. Therefore, a diagnostic accuracy case-control study was conducted, which included 75 girls aged 10-16 years, divided into three age-matched groups (normal, None-MetS, and MetS). Anthropometric indices, BIA parameters (including fat-free mass (FFM), body fat percent (BFP), and total body water (TBW)), blood pressure (BP), and blood samples were collected. Our main findings show that for girls in None-MetS and MetS groups, the waist circumference (WC) correlated positively with waist-hip ratio and mid-arm circumference (r = 0.58, 0.47, respectively), but not with BFP based on skinfold thickness (SFT), or mid-arm muscle area. WC was positively correlated with FFM and TBW, while high-density lipoprotein was inversely correlated with FFM. However, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides and BP showed no association with anthropometric measurements and BIA components. WC was the best indicator of MetS (AUC = 0.88, cut-off = 81.5 cm), followed by BMI (AUC = 0.84, cut-off = 26.9 kg/m",

        "Abstract": "Deep learning using neural networks relies on a class of machine-learnable models constructed using 'differentiable programs'. These programs can combine mathematical equations specific to a particular domain of natural science with general-purpose, machine-learnable components trained on experimental data. Such programs are having a growing impact on molecular and cellular biology. In this Perspective, we describe an emerging 'differentiable biology' in which phenomena ranging from the small and specific (for example, one experimental assay) to the broad and complex (for example, protein folding) can be modeled effectively and efficiently, often by exploiting knowledge about basic natural phenomena to overcome the limitations of sparse, incomplete and noisy data. By distilling differentiable biology into a small set of conceptual primitives and illustrative vignettes, we show how it can help to address long-standing challenges in integrating multimodal data from diverse experiments across biological scales. This promises to benefit fields as diverse as biophysics and functional genomics.",

In this work, we reconstruct the evolutionary events that have accompanied the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, with a special emphasis on the RBD and its adaptation for binding to its receptor, human ACE2.",

        "Abstract": "The functions of most proteins result from their 3D structures, but determining their structures experimentally remains a challenge, despite steady advances in crystallography, NMR and single-particle cryoEM. Computationally predicting the structure of a protein from its primary sequence has long been a grand challenge in bioinformatics, intimately connected with understanding protein chemistry and dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, combined with the availability of genomic data for inferring co-evolutionary patterns, provide a new approach to protein structure prediction that is complementary to longstanding physics-based approaches. The outstanding performance of AlphaFold2 in the recent Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) experiment demonstrates the remarkable power of deep learning in structure prediction. In this perspective, we focus on the key features of AlphaFold2, including its use of (i) attention mechanisms and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies, (ii) symmetry principles to facilitate reasoning over protein structures in three dimensions and (iii) end-to-end differentiability as a unifying framework for learning from protein data. The rules of protein folding are ultimately encoded in the physical principles that underpin it; to conclude, the implications of having a powerful computational model for structure prediction that does not explicitly rely on those principles are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Prediction of protein structure from sequence has been intensely studied for many decades, owing to the problem's importance and its uniquely well-defined physical and computational bases. While progress has historically ebbed and flowed, the past two years saw dramatic advances driven by the increasing \"neuralization\" of structure prediction pipelines, whereby computations previously based on energy models and sampling procedures are replaced by neural networks. The extraction of physical contacts from the evolutionary record; the distillation of sequence-structure patterns from known structures; the incorporation of templates from homologs in the Protein Databank; and the refinement of coarsely predicted structures into finely resolved ones have all been reformulated using neural networks. Cumulatively, this transformation has resulted in algorithms that can now predict single protein domains with a median accuracy of 2.1\u00a0\u00c5, setting the stage for a foundational reconfiguration of the role of biomolecular modeling within the life sciences.",

        "Title": "The Role of PKM2 in Metabolic Reprogramming: Insights into the Regulatory Roles of Non-Coding RNAs.",
        "Abstract": "Pyruvate kinase is a key regulator in glycolysis through the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate. Pyruvate kinase exists in various isoforms that can exhibit diverse biological functions and outcomes. The pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (PKM2) controls cell progression and survival through the regulation of key signaling pathways. In cancer cells, the dimer form of PKM2 predominates and plays an integral role in cancer metabolism. This predominance of the inactive dimeric form promotes the accumulation of phosphometabolites, allowing cancer cells to engage in high levels of synthetic processing to enhance their proliferative capacity. PKM2 has been recognized for its role in regulating gene expression and transcription factors critical for health and disease. This role enables PKM2 to exert profound regulatory effects that promote cancer cell metabolism, proliferation, and migration. In addition to its role in cancer, PKM2 regulates aspects essential to cellular homeostasis in non-cancer tissues and, in some cases, promotes tissue-specific pathways in health and diseases. In pursuit of understanding the diverse tissue-specific roles of PKM2, investigations targeting tissues such as the kidney, liver, adipose, and pancreas have been conducted. Findings from these studies enhance our understanding of PKM2 functions in various diseases beyond cancer. Therefore, there is substantial interest in PKM2 modulation as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple conditions. Indeed, a vast plethora of research has focused on identifying therapeutic strategies for targeting PKM2. Recently, targeting PKM2 through its regulatory microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) has gathered increasing interest. Thus, the goal of this review is to highlight recent advancements in PKM2 research, with a focus on PKM2 regulatory microRNAs and lncRNAs and their subsequent physiological significance.",

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities has sparked a worldwide concern to address rates of adipose tissue accrual. Recent studies have demonstrated a novel role of Zyflamend, a blend of natural herbal extracts, in regulating lipid metabolism in several cancer cell lines through the activation of the AMPK signalling pathway. Yet, the role of Zyflamend in adipogenic differentiation and lipid metabolism remains largely unexplored. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of Zyflamend on white 3T3-MBX pre-adipocyte differentiation and elucidate the molecular mechanisms. We demonstrate that Zyflamend treatment altered cell cycle progression, attenuated proliferation, and increased cell death of 3T3-MBX pre-adipocytes. In addition, treatment with Zyflamend inhibited lipid accumulation during the differentiation of 3T3-MBX cells, consistent with decreased expression of lipogenic genes and increased lipolysis. Mechanistically, Zyflamend-induced alterations in adipogenesis were mediated, at least in part, through the activation of AMPK, PKA, and JNK. Inhibition of AMPK partially reversed Zyflamend-induced inhibition of differentiation, whereas the inhibition of either JNK or PKA fully restored adipocyte differentiation and decreased lipolysis. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that Zyflamend, as a novel anti-adipogenic bioactive mix, inhibits adipocyte differentiation through the activation of the PKA and JNK pathways.",

In the betacoronavirus genus, which also includes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike protein, which, in turn, is responsible for viral binding to host cell receptors. Here, we find evidence of a recombination event in the RBD involving ancestral linages to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Although we cannot specify the recombinant nor the parental strains, likely due to the ancestry of the event and potential undersampling, our statistical analyses in the space of phylogenetic trees support such an ancestral recombination. Consequently, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share an RBD sequence that includes two insertions (positions 432-436 and 460-472), as well as the variants 427N and 436Y. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that interacts directly with the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor. Reconstruction of ancestral states, combined with protein-binding affinity analyses using the physics-based trRosetta algorithm, reveal that the recombination event involving ancestral strains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 led to an increased affinity for hACE2 binding, and that alleles 427N and 436Y significantly enhanced affinity as well. Structural modeling indicates that ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 may have acquired the ability to infect humans decades ago. The binding affinity with the human receptor was subsequently boosted in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through further mutations in RBD. In sum, we report an ancestral recombination event affecting the RBD of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that was associated with an increased binding affinity to hACE2.",

        "Abstract": "In mammalian cells, much of signal transduction is mediated by weak protein-protein interactions between globular peptide-binding domains (PBDs) and unstructured peptidic motifs in partner proteins. The number and diversity of these PBDs (over 1,800 are known), their low binding affinities and the sensitivity of binding properties to minor sequence variation represent a substantial challenge to experimental and computational analysis of PBD specificity and the networks PBDs create. Here, we introduce a bespoke machine-learning approach, hierarchical statistical mechanical modeling (HSM), capable of accurately predicting the affinities of PBD-peptide interactions across multiple protein families. By synthesizing biophysical priors within a modern machine-learning framework, HSM outperforms existing computational methods and high-throughput experimental assays. HSM models are interpretable in familiar biophysical terms at three spatial scales: the energetics of protein-peptide binding, the multidentate organization of protein-protein interactions and the global architecture of signaling networks.",

Here, we apply deep learning to unlabeled amino-acid sequences to distill the fundamental features of a protein into a statistical representation that is semantically rich and structurally, evolutionarily and biophysically grounded. We show that the simplest models built on top of this unified representation (UniRep) are broadly applicable and generalize to unseen regions of sequence space. Our data-driven approach predicts the stability of natural and de novo designed proteins, and the quantitative function of molecularly diverse mutants, competitively with the state-of-the-art methods. UniRep further enables two orders of magnitude efficiency improvement in a protein engineering task. UniRep is a versatile summary of fundamental protein features that can be applied across protein engineering informatics.",

        "Abstract": "Pyruvate kinase M2 is a critical enzyme that regulates cell metabolism and growth under different physiological conditions. In its metabolic role, pyruvate kinase M2 catalyzes the last glycolytic step which converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate with the generation of ATP. Beyond this metabolic role in glycolysis, PKM2 regulates gene expression in the nucleus, phosphorylates several essential proteins that regulate major cell signaling pathways, and contribute to the redox homeostasis of cancer cells. The expression of PKM2 has been demonstrated to be significantly elevated in several types of cancer, and the overall inflammatory response. The unusual pattern of PKM2 expression inspired scientists to investigate the unrevealed functions of PKM2 and the therapeutic potential of targeting PKM2 in cancer and other disorders. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to discuss the mechanistic and therapeutic potential of targeting PKM2 with the focus on cancer metabolism, redox homeostasis, inflammation, and metabolic disorders. This review highlights and provides insight into the metabolic and non-metabolic functions of PKM2 and its relevant association with health and disease.",

        "Abstract": "Computational prediction of protein structure from sequence is broadly viewed as a foundational problem of biochemistry and one of the most difficult challenges in bioinformatics. Once every two years the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments are held to assess the state of the art in the field in a blind fashion, by presenting predictor groups with protein sequences whose structures have been solved but have not yet been made publicly available. The first CASP was organized in 1994, and the latest, CASP13, took place last December, when for the first time the industrial laboratory DeepMind entered the competition. DeepMind's entry, AlphaFold, placed first in the Free Modeling (FM) category, which assesses methods on their ability to predict novel protein folds (the Zhang group placed first in the Template-Based Modeling (TBM) category, which assess methods on predicting proteins whose folds are related to ones already in the Protein Data Bank.) DeepMind's success generated significant public interest. Their approach builds on two ideas developed in the academic community during the preceding decade: (i) the use of co-evolutionary analysis to map residue co-variation in protein sequence to physical contact in protein structure, and (ii) the application of deep neural networks to robustly identify patterns in protein sequence and co-evolutionary couplings and convert them into contact maps. In this Letter, we contextualize the significance of DeepMind's entry within the broader history of CASP, relate AlphaFold's methodological advances to prior work, and speculate on the future of this important problem.",

        "Abstract": "Predicting protein structure from sequence is a central challenge of biochemistry. Co-evolution methods show promise, but an explicit sequence-to-structure map remains elusive. Advances in deep learning that replace complex, human-designed pipelines with differentiable models optimized end to end suggest the potential benefits of similarly reformulating structure prediction. Here, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable model for protein structure learning. The model couples local and global protein structure via geometric units that optimize global geometry without violating local covalent chemistry. We test our model using two challenging tasks: predicting novel folds without co-evolutionary data and predicting known folds without structural templates. In the first task, the model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, and in the second, it comes within 1-2\u00a0\u00c5; competing methods using co-evolution and experimental templates have been refined over many years, and it is likely that the differentiable approach has substantial room for further improvement, with applications ranging from drug discovery to protein design.",

        "Abstract": "The conversion of polymer parameterization from internal coordinates (bond lengths, angles, and torsions) to Cartesian coordinates is a fundamental task in molecular modeling, often performed using the natural extension reference frame (NeRF) algorithm. NeRF can be parallelized to process multiple polymers simultaneously, but is not parallelizable along the length of a single polymer. A mathematically equivalent algorithm, pNeRF, has been derived that is parallelizable along a polymer's length. Empirical analysis demonstrates an order-of-magnitude speed up using modern GPUs and CPUs. In machine learning-based workflows, in which partial derivatives are backpropagated through NeRF equations and neural network primitives, switching to pNeRF can reduce the fractional computational cost of coordinate conversion from over two-thirds to around 10%. An optimized TensorFlow-based implementation of pNeRF is available on GitHub at https://github.com/aqlaboratory/pnerf \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular interactions between proteins and DNA molecules underlie many cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, chromosome replication, and nucleosome positioning. Computational analyses of protein-DNA interactions rely on experimental data characterizing known protein-DNA interactions structurally and biochemically. While many databases exist that contain either structural or biochemical data, few integrate these two data sources in a unified fashion. Such integration is becoming increasingly critical with the rapid growth of structural and biochemical data, and the emergence of algorithms that rely on the synthesis of multiple data types to derive computational models of molecular interactions.",

        "Abstract": "Functional interpretation of genomic variation is critical to understanding human disease, but it remains difficult to predict the effects of specific mutations on protein interaction networks and the phenotypes they regulate. We describe an analytical framework based on multiscale statistical mechanics that integrates genomic and biophysical data to model the human SH2-phosphoprotein network in normal and cancer cells. We apply our approach to data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and test model predictions experimentally. We find that mutations mapping to phosphoproteins often create new interactions but that mutations altering SH2 domains result almost exclusively in loss of interactions. Some of these mutations eliminate all interactions, but many cause more selective loss, thereby rewiring specific edges in highly connected subnetworks. Moreover, idiosyncratic mutations appear to be as functionally consequential as recurrent mutations. By synthesizing genomic, structural and biochemical data, our framework represents a new approach to the interpretation of genetic variation.",

        "Abstract": "The energetics of protein-DNA interactions are often modeled using so-called statistical potentials, that is, energy models derived from the atomic structures of protein-DNA complexes. Many statistical protein-DNA potentials based on differing theoretical assumptions have been investigated, but little attention has been paid to the types of data and the parameter estimation process used in deriving the statistical potentials. We describe three enhancements to statistical potential inference that significantly improve the accuracy of predicted protein-DNA interactions: (i) incorporation of binding energy data of protein-DNA complexes, in conjunction with their X-ray crystal structures, (ii) use of spatially-aware parameter fitting, and (iii) use of ensemble-based parameter fitting. We apply these enhancements to three widely-used statistical potentials and use the resulting enhanced potentials in a structure-based prediction of the DNA binding sites of proteins. These enhancements are directly applicable to all statistical potentials used in protein-DNA modeling, and we show that they can improve the accuracy of predicted DNA binding sites by up to 21%.",

        "Abstract": "Compressed sensing has revolutionized signal acquisition, by enabling complex signals to be measured with remarkable fidelity using a small number of so-called incoherent sensors. We show that molecular interactions, e.g., protein-DNA interactions, can be analyzed in a directly analogous manner and with similarly remarkable results. Specifically, mesoscopic molecular interactions act as incoherent sensors that measure the energies of microscopic interactions between atoms. We combine concepts from compressed sensing and statistical mechanics to determine the interatomic interaction energies of a molecular system exclusively from experimental measurements, resulting in a \"de novo\" energy potential. In contrast, conventional methods for estimating energy potentials are based on theoretical models premised on a priori assumptions and extensive domain knowledge. We determine the de novo energy potential for pairwise interactions between protein and DNA atoms from (i) experimental measurements of the binding affinity of protein-DNA complexes and (ii) crystal structures of the complexes. We show that the de novo energy potential can be used to predict the binding specificity of proteins to DNA with approximately 90% accuracy, compared to approximately 60% for the best performing alternative computational methods applied to this fundamental problem. This de novo potential method is directly extendable to other biomolecule interaction domains (enzymes and signaling molecule interactions) and to other classes of molecular interactions.",
