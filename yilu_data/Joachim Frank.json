        "Abstract": "ManifoldEM is an established method of geometric machine learning developed to extract information on conformational motions of molecules from their projections obtained by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In a previous work, in-depth analysis of the properties of manifolds obtained for simulated ground-truth data from molecules exhibiting domain motions has led to improvements of this method, as demonstrated in selected applications of single-particle cryo-EM. In the present work this analysis has been extended to investigate the properties of manifolds constructed by embedding data from synthetic models represented by atomic coordinates in motion, or three-dimensional density maps from biophysical experiments other than single-particle cryo-EM, with extensions to cryo-electron tomography and single-particle imaging with a X-ray free-electron laser. Our theoretical analysis revealed interesting relationships between all these manifolds, which can be exploited in future work.",

        "Abstract": "This work is based on the manifold-embedding approach to study biological molecules exhibiting continuous conformational changes. Previous work established a method-now termed ManifoldEM-capable of reconstructing 3D movies and accompanying free-energy landscapes from single-particle cryo-EM images of macromolecules exercising multiple conformational degrees of freedom. While ManifoldEM has proven its viability in several experimental studies, critical limitations and uncertainties have been found throughout its extended development and use. Guided by insights from studies with cryo-EM ground-truth data, simulated from atomic structures undergoing conformational changes, we have built a novel framework, ESPER, able to retrieve the free-energy landscape and respective 3D Coulomb potential maps for all states simulated. As shown by a direct comparison of ground truth vs. recovered maps, and analysis of experimental data from the 80S ribosome and ryanodine receptor, ESPER offers substantial improvements relative to the previous work.",

        "Title": "Molecular architecture of 40S translation initiation complexes on the hepatitis C virus IRES.",
        "Abstract": "Hepatitis C virus mRNA contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that mediates end-independent translation initiation, requiring a subset of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Biochemical studies revealed that direct binding of the IRES to the 40S ribosomal subunit places the initiation codon into the P site, where it base pairs with eIF2-bound Met-tRNAiMet forming a 48S initiation complex. Subsequently, eIF5 and eIF5B mediate subunit joining, yielding an elongation-competent 80S ribosome. Initiation can also proceed without eIF2, in which case Met-tRNAiMet is recruited directly by eIF5B. However, the structures of initiation complexes assembled on the HCV IRES, the transitions between different states, and the accompanying conformational changes have remained unknown. To fill these gaps, we now obtained cryo-EM structures of IRES initiation complexes, at resolutions up to 3.5\u2009\u00c5, that cover all major stages from the initial ribosomal association, through eIF2-containing 48S initiation complexes, to eIF5B-containing complexes immediately prior to subunit joining. These structures provide insights into the dynamic network of 40S/IRES contacts, highlight the role of IRES domain II, and reveal conformational changes that occur during the transition from eIF2- to eIF5B-containing 48S complexes and prepare them for subunit joining.",

        "Title": "RRM1 variants cause a mitochondrial DNA maintenance disorder via impaired de novo nucleotide synthesis.",
        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion/deletions syndromes (MDDS) encompass a clinically and etiologically heterogenous group of mitochondrial disorders caused by impaired mtDNA maintenance. Among the most frequent causes of MDDS are defects in nucleoside/nucleotide metabolism, which is critical for synthesis and homeostasis of the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) substrates of mtDNA replication. A central enzyme for generating dNTPs is ribonucleotide reductase, a critical mediator of de novo nucleotide synthesis composed of catalytic RRM1 subunits in complex with RRM2 or p53R2. Here, we report 5 probands from 4 families who presented with ptosis and ophthalmoplegia as well as other clinical manifestations and multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle. We identified 3 RRM1 loss-of-function variants, including a dominant catalytic site variant (NP_001024.1: p.N427K) and 2 homozygous recessive variants at p.R381, which has evolutionarily conserved interactions with the specificity site. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations indicate mechanisms by which RRM1 variants affect protein structure. Cultured primary skin fibroblasts of probands manifested mtDNA depletion under cycling conditions, indicating impaired de novo nucleotide synthesis. Fibroblasts also exhibited aberrant nucleoside diphosphate and dNTP pools and mtDNA ribonucleotide incorporation. Our data reveal that primary RRM1 deficiency and, by extension, impaired de novo nucleotide synthesis are causes of MDDS.",

This is due to the technique's intrinsic power to depict both structural and dynamic features of molecules; in this case, of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. By now, numerous cryo-EM studies have furthered our understanding of spike protein-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor interactions, which has informed the design of effective vaccines, and have enabled the characterization of neutralizing antibody binding sites, which will lead to the design of novel therapeutics as the virus evolves.",

Instead, today's users have to rely on the functionality of software systems that have little or no transparency. As a consequence, users of such packages no longer gain a conceptual understanding and intuitive grasp of the analytical routes leading from the stream of input data to the final density map. Possible remedies of this situation with free software are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection is controlled by the opening of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), which transitions from a glycan-shielded 'down' to an exposed 'up' state to bind the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and infect cells. While snapshots of the 'up' and 'down' states have been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomagraphy, details of the RBD-opening transition evade experimental characterization. Here over 130 \u00b5s of weighted ensemble simulations of the fully glycosylated spike ectodomain allow us to characterize more than 300 continuous, kinetically unbiased RBD-opening pathways. Together with ManifoldEM analysis of cryo-electron microscopy data and biolayer interferometry experiments, we reveal a gating role for the N-glycan at position N343, which facilitates RBD opening. Residues D405, R408 and D427 also participate. The atomic-level characterization of the glycosylated spike activation mechanism provided herein represents a landmark study for ensemble pathway simulations and offers a foundation for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and infection.",

        "Abstract": "The balanced processing of the internal mental world and the external world is a crucial aspect of everyday well-being. An extensive control of the internal emotional and cognitive world that often results in an internal expression of distress is a common feature of internalizing disorders. However, how depression affects the processing of the external world is still an open question. We, therefore, tested the processing of visual signals in major depressive disorder (MDD). To this end, we recorded the electroencephalogram of 38 MDD patients and 38 controls, while they performed a response-choice task with informative feedback and a passive viewing task. MDD patients differed significantly from controls in the early information processing of visual stimuli. The vertex positive potential (VPP) evoked by feedback in the response-choice task and pictures in the passive viewing task were smaller in MDD patients than in controls. This outcome suggests that depression might subtract attentional resources from external signal processing, with potential consequences in various cognitive domains.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection is controlled by the opening of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), which transitions from a glycan-shielded \"down\" to an exposed \"up\" state in order to bind the human ACE2 receptor and infect cells. While snapshots of the \"up\" and \"down\" states have been obtained by cryoEM and cryoET, details of the RBD opening transition evade experimental characterization. Here, over 130 \u03bcs of weighted ensemble (WE) simulations of the fully glycosylated spike ectodomain allow us to characterize more than 300 continuous, kinetically unbiased RBD opening pathways. Together with ManifoldEM analysis of cryo-EM data and biolayer interferometry experiments, we reveal a gating role for the N-glycan at position N343, which facilitates RBD opening. Residues D405, R408, and D427 also participate. The atomic-level characterization of the glycosylated spike activation mechanism provided herein achieves a new high-water mark for ensemble pathway simulations and offers a foundation for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and infection.",

        "Title": "Interaction Networks of Ribosomal Expansion Segments in Kinetoplastids.",
        "Abstract": "Expansion segments (ES) are insertions of a few to hundreds of nucleotides at discrete locations on eukaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA) chains. Some cluster around 'hot spots' involved in translation regulation and some may participate in biogenesis. Whether ES play the same roles in different organisms is currently unclear, especially since their size may vary dramatically from one species to another and very little is known about their functions. Most likely, ES variation is linked to adaptation to a particular environment. In this chapter, we compare the interaction networks of ES from four kinetoplastid parasites, which have evolved in diverse insect vectors and mammalian hosts: Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, Leishmania donovani and Leishmania major. Here, we comparatively analyze ribosome structures from these representative kinetoplastids and ascertain meaningful structural differences from mammalian ribosomes. We base our analysis on sequence alignments and three-dimensional structures of 80S ribosomes solved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Striking differences in size are observed between ribosomes of different parasites, indicating that not all ES are expanded equally. Larger ES are not always matched by large surrounding ES or proteins extensions in their vicinity, a particularity that may lead to clues about their biological function. ES display different species-specific patterns of conservation, which underscore the density of their interaction network at the surface of the ribosome. Making sense of the conservation patterns of ES is part of a global effort to lay the basis for functional studies aimed at discovering unique kinetoplastid-specific sites suitable for therapeutic applications against these human and often animal pathogens.",

Prior studies have achieved selective and controllable ion transport through electrical, optical, or chemical gating of complex nanostructures. Here, we mechanically control nanofluidic transport using nanobubbles. When plugging nanochannels, nanobubbles rectify and occasionally enhance ionic currents in a geometry-dependent manner. These conductance effects arise from nanobubbles inducing surface-governed ion transport through interfacial electrolyte films residing between nanobubble surfaces and nanopipette walls. The nanobubbles investigated here are mechanically generated, made metastable by surface pinning, and verified with cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. Our findings are relevant to nanofluidic device engineering, three-phase interface properties, and nanopipette-based applications.",

        "Abstract": "The role of the ribosome in the regulation of gene expression has come into increased focus. It is proposed that ribosomes are catalytic engines capable of changing their protein composition in response to environmental stimuli. Time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques are employed to identify quantitative changes in the protein composition and structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 80S ribosomes after shifting the carbon source from glucose to glycerol. Using cryo-EM combined with the computational classification approach, it is found that a fraction of the yeast cells' 80S ribosomes lack ribosomal proteins at the entrance and exit sites for tRNAs, including uL16(RPL10), eS1(RPS1), uS11(RPS14A/B), and eS26(RPS26A/B). This fraction increased after a change from glucose to glycerol medium. The quantitative structural analysis supports the hypothesis that ribosomes are dynamic complexes that alter their composition in response to changes in growth or environmental conditions.",

        "Abstract": "A primary reason for the intense interest in structural biology is the fact that knowledge of structure can elucidate macromolecular functions in living organisms. Sustained effort has resulted in an impressive arsenal of tools for determining the static structures. But under physiological conditions, macromolecules undergo continuous conformational changes, a subset of which are functionally important. Techniques for capturing the continuous conformational changes underlying function are essential for further progress. Here, we present chemically-detailed conformational movies of biological function, extracted data-analytically from experimental single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) snapshots of ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1), a calcium-activated calcium channel engaged in the binding of ligands. The functional motions differ substantially from those inferred from static structures in the nature of conformationally active structural domains, the sequence and extent of conformational motions, and the way allosteric signals are transduced within and between domains. Our approach highlights the importance of combining experiment, advanced data analysis, and molecular simulations.",

        "Abstract": "It has been known for more than 50 years that transcription and translation are physically coupled in bacteria, but whether or not this coupling may be mediated by the two-domain protein N-utilization substance (Nus) G in Escherichia coli is still heavily debated. Here, we combine integrative structural biology and functional analyses to provide conclusive evidence that NusG can physically link transcription with translation by contacting both RNA polymerase and the ribosome. We present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of a NusG:70S ribosome complex and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data revealing simultaneous binding of NusG to RNAP and the intact 70S ribosome, providing the first direct structural evidence for NusG-mediated coupling. Furthermore, in\u00a0vivo reporter assays show that recruitment of NusG occurs late in transcription and strongly depends on translation. Thus, our data suggest that coupling occurs initially via direct RNAP:ribosome contacts and is then mediated by NusG.",

        "Abstract": "Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels convert cyclic nucleotide (CN) binding and unbinding into electrical signals in sensory receptors and neurons. The molecular conformational changes underpinning ligand activation are largely undefined. We report both closed- and open-state atomic cryo-EM structures of a full-length Caenorhabditis elegans cyclic GMP-activated channel TAX-4, reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs. These structures, together with computational and functional analyses and a mutant channel structure, reveal a double-barrier hydrophobic gate formed by two S6 amino acids in the central cavity. cGMP binding produces global conformational changes that open the cavity gate located ~52\u2009\u00c5 away but do not alter the structure of the selectivity filter-the commonly presumed activation gate. Our work provides mechanistic insights into the allosteric gating and regulation of CN-gated and nucleotide-modulated channels and CNG channel-related channelopathies.",

Here, we combine live-cell microscopy with in situ cryo-electron tomography to directly visualize ER dynamics in several secretory cell types including pancreatic \u03b2-cells and neurons under near-native conditions. Using these imaging approaches, we identify a novel, mobile form of ER, ribosome-associated vesicles (RAVs), found primarily in the cell periphery, which is conserved across different cell types and species. We show that RAVs exist as distinct, highly dynamic structures separate from the intact ER reticular architecture that interact with mitochondria via direct intermembrane contacts. These findings describe a new ER subcompartment within cells.",

        "Abstract": "Recent approaches to the study of biological molecules employ manifold learning to single-particle cryo-EM data sets to map the continuum of states of a molecule into a low-dimensional space spanned by eigenvectors or \"conformational coordinates\". This is done separately for each projection direction (PD) on an angular grid. One important step in deriving a consolidated map of occupancies, from which the free energy landscape of the molecule can be derived, is to propagate the conformational coordinates from a given choice of \"anchor PD\" across the entire angular space. Even when one eigenvector dominates, its sign might invert from one PD to the next. The propagation of the second eigenvector is particularly challenging when eigenvalues of the second and third eigenvector are closely matched, leading to occasional inversions in their ranking as we move across the angular grid. In the absence of a computational approach, this propagation across the angular space has been done thus far \"by hand\" using visual clues, thus greatly limiting the general use of the technique. In this work we have developed a method that is able to solve the propagation problem computationally, by using optical flow and a probabilistic graphical model. We demonstrate its utility by selected examples.",

        "Abstract": "Free-energy landscapes are a powerful tool for analyzing dynamical processes - capable of providing a complete mapping of a system's configurations in state space while articulating its energetics topologically in the form of sprawling hills and valleys. Within this mapping, the path of least action can be derived - representing the most probable sequence of transitions taken between any two states in the landscape. In this article, POLARIS (Path of Least Action Recursive Survey) is presented as a dynamic, global approach that efficiently automates the discovery of the least action path on previously determined 2D energy landscapes. Important built-in features of this program include plotting of landscape trajectories and transition state theory diagrams, generation of text files with least action coordinates and respective energies, and bifurcation analysis tools that provide downstream versatility for comparing most probable paths and reaction rates.",

        "Abstract": "Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is a multi-faceted syndrome decimating bee populations worldwide, and a group of viruses of the widely distributed Dicistroviridae family have been identified as a causing agent of CCD. This family of viruses employs non-coding RNA sequences, called internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs), to precisely exploit the host machinery for viral protein production. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we have characterized how the IRES of Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) intergenic region captures and redirects translating ribosomes toward viral RNA messages. We reconstituted two in\u00a0vitro reactions targeting a pre-translocation and a post-translocation state of the IAPV-IRES in the ribosome, allowing us to identify six structures using image processing classification methods. From these, we reconstructed the trajectory of IAPV-IRES from the early small subunit recruitment to the final post-translocated state in the ribosome. An early commitment of IRES/ribosome complexes for global pre-translocation mimicry explains the high efficiency observed for this IRES. Efforts directed toward fighting CCD by targeting the IAPV-IRES using RNA-interference technology are underway, and the structural framework presented here may assist in further refining these approaches.",

        "Title": "The structural basis for release-factor activation during translation termination revealed by time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy.",
        "Abstract": "When the ribosome encounters a stop codon, it recruits a release factor (RF) to hydrolyze the ester bond between the peptide chain and tRNA. RFs have structural motifs that recognize stop codons in the decoding center and a GGQ motif for induction of hydrolysis in the peptidyl transfer center 70\u2009\u00c5 away. Surprisingly, free RF2 is compact, with only 20\u2009\u00c5 between its codon-reading and GGQ motifs. Cryo-EM showed that ribosome-bound RFs have extended structures, suggesting that RFs are compact when entering the ribosome and then extend their structures upon stop codon recognition. Here we use time-resolved cryo-EM to visualize transient compact forms of RF1 and RF2 at 3.5 and 4\u2009\u00c5 resolution, respectively, in the codon-recognizing ribosome complex on the native pathway. About 25% of complexes have RFs in the compact state at 24\u2009ms reaction time, and within 60\u2009ms virtually all ribosome-bound RFs are transformed to their extended forms.",

        "Abstract": "Membrane proteins function in native cell membranes, but extraction into isolated particles is needed for many biochemical and structural analyses. Commonly used detergent-extraction methods destroy naturally associated lipid bilayers. Here, we devised a detergent-free method for preparing cell-membrane nanoparticles to study the multidrug exporter AcrB, by cryo-EM at 3.2-\u00c5 resolution. We discovered a remarkably well-organized lipid-bilayer structure associated with transmembrane domains of the AcrB trimer. This bilayer patch comprises 24 lipid molecules; inner leaflet chains are packed in a hexagonal array, whereas the outer leaflet has highly irregular but ordered packing. Protein side chains interact with both leaflets and participate in the hexagonal pattern. We suggest that the lipid bilayer supports and harmonizes peristaltic motions through AcrB trimers. In AcrB D407A, a putative proton-relay mutant, lipid bilayer buttresses protein interactions lost in crystal structures after detergent-solubilization. Our detergent-free system preserves lipid-protein interactions for visualization and should be broadly applicable.",

        "Abstract": "The eukaryotic ribosomal protein RACK1/Asc1p is localized to the mRNA exit channel of the 40S subunit but lacks a defined role in mRNA translation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae deficient in ASC1 exhibit temperature-sensitive growth. Using this null mutant, potential roles for Asc1p in translation and ribosome biogenesis are evaluated. At the restrictive temperature the asc1\u0394 null mutant has reduced polyribosomes. To test the role of Asc1p in ribosome stability, cryo-EM is used to examine the structure of 80S ribosomes in an asc1\u0394 yeast deletion mutant at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. CryoEM indicates that loss of Asc1p does not severely disrupt formation of this complex structure. No defect is found in rRNA processing in the asc1\u0394 null mutant. A proteomic approach is applied to survey the effect of Asc1p loss on the global translation of yeast proteins. At the nonpermissive temperature, the asc1\u0394 mutant has reduced levels of ribosomal proteins and other factors critical for translation. Collectively, these results are consistent with recent observations suggesting that Asc1p is important for ribosome occupancy of short mRNAs. The results show the Asc1 ribosomal protein is critical in translation during heat stress.",

Here we show that exposure to electrons under cryo-EM conditions leads to a small change in the quaternary structure of the Thermoplasma acidophilum proteasome, and that backbones atoms belonging to the \u03b1-helices in this molecule appear to be particular prone to chemical damage. A chemical mechanism is proposed for this damage. Both this local chemical effect and the more global quaternary structure effect appear to heterogenize samples leading to a radiation dose-dependent degradation of the resolution of the EM maps obtained from this molecule.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial diseases produce profound neurological dysfunction via mutations affecting mitochondrial energy production, including the relatively common Leigh syndrome (LS). We recently described an LS case caused by a pathogenic mutation in USMG5, encoding a small supernumerary subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase. This protein is integral for ATP synthase dimerization, and patient fibroblasts revealed an almost total loss of ATP synthase dimers. Here, we utilize in situ cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) in a clinical case-control study of mitochondrial disease to directly study mitochondria within cultured fibroblasts from a patient with LS and a healthy human control subject. Through tomographic analysis of patient and control mitochondria, we find that loss of ATP synthase dimerization due to the pathogenic mutation causes profound disturbances of mitochondrial crista ultrastructure. Overall, this work supports the crucial role of ATP synthase in regulating crista architecture in the context of human disease.",

        "Abstract": "The regulatory role of the ribosome in gene expression has come into sharper focus. It has been proposed that ribosomes are dynamic complexes capable of changing their protein composition in response to environmental stimuli. MS is applied to identify quantitative changes in the protein composition of S. cerevisiae 80S ribosomes in response to different environmental stimuli. Using quantitative MS, it is found that the paralog yeast ribosomal proteins RPL8A (eL8A) and RPL8B (eL8B) change their relative proportions in the 80S ribosome when yeast is switched from growth in glucose to glycerol. By using yeast genetics and polysome profiling, it is shown that yeast ribosomes containing either RPL8A or RPL8B are not functionally interchangeable. The quantitative proteomic data support the hypothesis that ribosomes are dynamic complexes that alter their composition and functional activity in response to changes in growth or environmental conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) directly images the distribution of electrostatic potential (ESP) within macromolecules, and thus can provide much more information about atomic charge than X-ray crystallography. The electron-scattering length of an isolated ion is quite different from that of the corresponding neutral atom. The difference is very large at small scattering angles where the effects of electron distributions are largest, but becomes smaller at high scattering angles where nuclear charge determines outcomes. For this reason, in cryo-EM maps that have been solved at resolutions lower than \u223c2.5\u2005\u00c5, peaks corresponding to anions will always be less prominent than those of cations, and may even be negative. Furthermore, if a map of this kind is smeared computationally after the fact, which reduces its effective resolution, anion peaks will diminish in size, cation peaks will grow and peaks that represent uncharged atoms will remain about the same. These effects can be used to determine the sign of the charges carried by the ions associated with a macromolecule and even estimate their magnitudes. The ESP value for a cation in a cation-anion pair is smaller than the value of the cation in isolation, but the ESP value for the anion in the ionic pair is greater than the value of the anion in isolation. The experimental range of ESP values for Mg",

        "Abstract": "In the past 4 years, because of the advent of new cameras, many ribosome structures have been solved by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) at high, often near-atomic resolution, bringing new mechanistic insights into the processes of translation initiation, peptide elongation, termination, and recycling. Thus, cryo-EM has joined X-ray crystallography as a powerful technique in structural studies of translation. The significance of this new development is that structures of ribosomes in complex with their functional binding partners can now be determined to high resolution in multiple states as they perform their work. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of these new studies and assess the contributions they have made toward an understanding of translation and translational control.",

Here we used cryo-EM to study the molecular origins of the accuracy of ribosome-aided recognition of a cognate ternary complex and the accuracy-amplifying role of the monitoring bases A1492, A1493 and G530 of the 16S rRNA. We used the GTPase-deficient EF-Tu variant H84A with native GTP, rather than non-cleavable GTP analogues, to trap a near-cognate ternary complex in high-resolution ribosomal complexes of varying codon-recognition accuracy. We found that ribosome complexes trapped by GTPase-deficicent ternary complex due to the presence of EF-TuH84A or non-cleavable GTP analogues have very similar structures. We further discuss speed and accuracy of initial aa-tRNA selection in terms of conformational changes of aa-tRNA and stepwise activation of the monitoring bases at the decoding center of the ribosome.",

Among its advantages over X-ray crystallography are (1) no need for crystals, (2) much smaller sample volumes, and (3) the ability to determine multiple structures or conformations coexisting in one sample. In principle, kinetic experiments can be done using standard cryo-EM, but mixing and freezing grids require several seconds. However, many biological processes are much faster than that time scale, and the ensuing short-lived states of the molecules cannot be captured.

        "Abstract": "Translation initiation in eukaryotes is a highly regulated and rate-limiting process. It results in the assembly and disassembly of numerous transient and intermediate complexes involving over a dozen eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). This process culminates in the accommodation of a start codon marking the beginning of an open reading frame at the appropriate ribosomal site. Although this process has been extensively studied by hundreds of groups for nearly half a century, it has been only recently, especially during the last decade, that we have gained deeper insight into the mechanics of the eukaryotic translation initiation process. This advance in knowledge is due in part to the contributions of structural biology, which have shed light on the molecular mechanics underlying the different functions of various eukaryotic initiation factors. In this review, we focus exclusively on the contribution of structural biology to the understanding of the eukaryotic initiation process, a long-standing jigsaw puzzle that is just starting to yield the bigger picture.",

        "Abstract": "AMPA (\u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission throughout the central nervous system. Gated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, AMPA receptors are critical for synaptic strength, and dysregulation of AMPA receptor-mediated signalling is linked to numerous neurological diseases. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structures of AMPA receptor-auxiliary subunit complexes in the apo, antagonist- and agonist-bound states and determine the iris-like mechanism of ion channel opening. The ion channel selectivity filter is formed by the extended portions of the re-entrant M2 loops, while the helical portions of M2 contribute to extensive hydrophobic interfaces between AMPA receptor subunits in the ion channel. We show how the permeation pathway changes upon channel opening and identify conformational changes throughout the entire AMPA receptor that accompany activation and desensitization. Our findings provide a framework for understanding gating across the family of ionotropic glutamate receptors and the role of AMPA receptors in excitatory neurotransmission.",

        "Abstract": "Fast excitatory neurotransmission is mediated by AMPA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs). AMPARs, localized at post-synaptic densities, are regulated by transmembrane auxiliary subunits that modulate AMPAR assembly, trafficking, gating, and pharmacology. Aberrancies in AMPAR-mediated signaling are associated with numerous neurological disorders. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of an AMPAR in complex with the auxiliary subunit GSG1L in the closed and desensitized states. GSG1L favors the AMPAR desensitized state, where channel closure is facilitated by profound structural rearrangements in the AMPAR extracellular domain, with ligand-binding domain dimers losing their local 2-fold rotational symmetry. Our structural and functional experiments suggest that AMPAR auxiliary subunits share a modular architecture and use a common transmembrane scaffold for\u00a0distinct extracellular modules to differentially regulate AMPAR gating. By comparing the AMPAR-GSG1L complex structures, we map conformational changes accompanying AMPAR recovery from desensitization and reveal structural bases for regulation of synaptic transmission by auxiliary subunits.",

        "Abstract": "The work of molecular machines such as the ribosome is accompanied by conformational changes, often characterized by relative motions of their domains. The method we have developed seeks to quantify these motions in a general way, facilitating comparisons of results obtained by different researchers. Typically there are multiple snapshots of a structure in the form of pdb coordinates resulting from flexible fitting of low-resolution density maps, from X-ray crystallography, or from molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. Our objective is to characterize the motion of each domain as a coordinate transformation using moments of inertia tensor, a method we developed earlier. What has been missing until now are ancillary tools that make this task practical, general, and biologically informative. We have provided a comprehensive solution to this task with a set of tools implemented on the VMD platform. These tools address the need for reproducible segmentation of domains, and provide a generalized description of their motions using principal axes of inertia. Although this methodology has been specifically developed for studying ribosome motion, it is applicable to any molecular machine.",

        "Abstract": "During ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, nascent subunits are exported to the cytoplasm in a functionally inactive state. 60S subunits are activated through a series of cytoplasmic maturation events. The last known events in the cytoplasm are the release of Tif6 by Efl1 and Sdo1 and the release of the export adapter, Nmd3, by the GTPase Lsg1. Here, we have used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of the 60S subunit bound by Nmd3, Lsg1, and Tif6. We find that a central domain of Nmd3 mimics the translation elongation factor eIF5A, inserting into the E site of the ribosome and pulling the L1 stalk into a closed position. Additional domains occupy the P site and extend toward the sarcin-ricin loop to interact with Tif6. Nmd3 and Lsg1 together embrace helix 69 of the B2a intersubunit bridge, inducing base flipping that we suggest may activate the GTPase activity of Lsg1.",

        "Abstract": "During the work cycle of elongation, the ribosome, a molecular machine of vast complexity, exists in a large number of states distinguished by constellation of its subunits, its subunit domains and binding partners. Single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), developed over the past 40 years, is uniquely suited to determine the structure of molecular machines in their native states. With the emergence, 10 years ago, of unsupervised clustering techniques in the analysis of single-particle data, it has been possible to determine multiple structures from a sample containing ribosomes equilibrating in different thermally accessible states. In addition, recent advances in detector technology have made it possible to reach near-atomic resolution for some of these states. With these capabilities, single-particle cryo-EM has been at the forefront of exploring ribosome dynamics during its functional cycle, along with single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and molecular dynamics computations, offering insights into molecular architecture uniquely honed by evolution to capitalize on thermal energy in the ambient environment.This article is part of the themed issue 'Perspectives on the ribosome'.",

        "Abstract": "Upon encountering a stop codon on mRNA, polypeptide synthesis on the ribosome is terminated by release factors, and the ribosome complex, still bound with mRNA and P-site-bound tRNA (post-termination complex, PostTC), is split into ribosomal subunits, ready for a new round of translational initiation. Separation of post-termination ribosomes into subunits, or \"ribosome recycling,\" is promoted by the joint action of ribosome-recycling factor (RRF) and elongation factor G (EF-G) in a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis-dependent manner. Here we used a mixing-spraying-based method of time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize the short-lived intermediates of the recycling process. The two complexes that contain (1) both RRF and EF-G bound to the PostTC or (2) deacylated tRNA bound to the 30S subunit are of particular interest. Our observations of the native form of these complexes demonstrate the strong potential of time-resolved cryo-EM for visualizing previously unobservable transient structures.",

Examination of this structure and comparative analysis of the yeast ribosomal assembly pathway allowed us to develop a stepwise assembly model for the eight pieces of the large subunit rRNAs and a number of ancillary \"glue\" proteins.

        "Abstract": "The type-1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is an intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel required for skeletal muscle contraction. Here, we present cryo-EM reconstructions of RyR1 in multiple functional states revealing the structural basis of channel gating and ligand-dependent activation. Binding sites for the channel activators Ca(2+), ATP, and caffeine were identified at interdomain interfaces of the C-terminal domain. Either ATP or Ca(2+) alone induces conformational changes in the cytoplasmic assembly (\"priming\"), without pore dilation. In contrast, in the presence of all three activating ligands, high-resolution reconstructions of open and closed states of RyR1 were obtained from the same sample, enabling analyses of conformational changes associated with\u00a0gating. Gating involves global conformational changes in the cytosolic assembly accompanied by local changes in the transmembrane domain, which include bending of the S6 transmembrane segment and consequent pore dilation, displacement, and deformation of the S4-S5 linker and conformational changes in the pseudo-voltage-sensor domain.",

        "Abstract": "Vitamin A homeostasis is critical to normal cellular function. Retinol-binding protein (RBP) is the sole specific carrier in the bloodstream for hydrophobic retinol, the main form in which vitamin A is transported. The integral membrane receptor STRA6 mediates cellular uptake of vitamin A by recognizing RBP-retinol to trigger release and internalization of retinol. We present the structure of zebrafish STRA6 determined to 3.9-angstrom resolution by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. STRA6 has one intramembrane and nine transmembrane helices in an intricate dimeric assembly. Unexpectedly, calmodulin is bound tightly to STRA6 in a noncanonical arrangement. Residues involved with RBP binding map to an archlike structure that covers a deep lipophilic cleft. This cleft is open to the membrane, suggesting a possible mode for internalization of retinol through direct diffusion into the lipid bilayer.",

        "Abstract": "AMPA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission and contribute to high cognitive processes such as learning and memory. In the brain, AMPAR trafficking, gating, and pharmacology is tightly controlled by transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the structural basis of AMPAR regulation by one of these auxiliary proteins, TARP \u03b32, or stargazin (STZ). Our structures illuminate the variable interaction stoichiometry of the AMPAR-TARP complex, with one or two TARP molecules binding one tetrameric AMPAR. Analysis of the AMPAR-STZ binding interfaces suggests that electrostatic interactions between the extracellular domains of AMPAR and STZ play an important role in modulating AMPAR function through contact surfaces that are conserved across AMPARs and TARPs. We propose a model explaining how TARPs stabilize the activated state of AMPARs and how the interactions between AMPARs and their auxiliary proteins control fast excitatory synaptic transmission.",

        "Abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy, when combined with single-particle reconstruction, is a powerful method for studying macromolecular structure. Recent developments in detector technology have pushed the resolution into a range comparable to that of X-ray crystallography. However, cryo-EM is able to separate and thus recover the structure of each of several discrete structures present in the sample. For the more general case involving continuous structural changes, a novel technique employing manifold embedding has been recently demonstrated. Potentially, the entire work-cycle of a molecular machine may be observed as it passes through a continuum of states, and its free-energy landscape may be mapped out. This technique will be outlined and discussed in the context of its application to a large single-particle dataset of yeast ribosomes.",

        "Abstract": "The capabilities and application range of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) method have expanded vastly in the last two years, thanks to the advances provided by direct detection devices and computational classification tools. We take this review as an opportunity to sketch out promising developments of cryo-EM in two important directions: (i) imaging of short-lived states (10-1000 ms) of biological molecules by using time-resolved cryo-EM, particularly the mixing-spraying method and (ii) recovering an entire continuum of coexisting states from the same sample by employing a computational technique called manifold embedding. It is tempting to think of combining these two methods, to elucidate the way the states of a molecular machine such as the ribosome branch and unfold. This idea awaits further developments of both methods, particularly by increasing the data yield of the time-resolved cryo-EM method and by developing the manifold embedding technique into a user-friendly workbench.",

        "Abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum, the mosquito-transmitted Apicomplexan parasite, causes the most severe form of human malaria. In the asexual blood-stage, the parasite resides within erythrocytes where it proliferates, multiplies and finally spreads to new erythrocytes. Development of drugs targeting the ribosome, the site of protein synthesis, requires specific knowledge of its structure and work cycle, and, critically, the ways they differ from those in the human host. Here, we present five cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions of ribosomes purified from P. falciparum blood-stage schizonts at sub-nanometer resolution. Atomic models were built from these density maps by flexible fitting. Significantly, our study has taken advantage of new capabilities of cryo-EM, in visualizing several structures co-existing in the sample at once, at a resolution sufficient for building atomic models. We have discovered structural and dynamic features that differentiate the ribosomes of P. falciparum from those of mammalian system. Prompted by the absence of RACK1 on the ribosome in our and an earlier study we confirmed that RACK1 does not specifically co-purify with the 80S fraction in schizonts. More extensive studies, using cryo-EM methodology, of translation in the parasite will provide structural knowledge that may lead to development of novel anti-malarials.",

        "Abstract": "During eukaryotic translation initiation, 43S complexes, comprising a 40S ribosomal subunit, initiator transfer RNA and initiation factors (eIF) 2, 3, 1 and 1A, attach to the 5'-terminal region of messenger RNA and scan along it to the initiation codon. Scanning on structured mRNAs also requires the DExH-box protein DHX29. Mammalian eIF3 contains 13 subunits and participates in nearly all steps of translation initiation. Eight subunits having PCI (proteasome, COP9 signalosome, eIF3) or MPN (Mpr1, Pad1, amino-terminal) domains constitute the structural core of eIF3, to which five peripheral subunits are flexibly linked. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of eIF3 in the context of the DHX29-bound 43S complex, showing the PCI/MPN core at \u223c6 \u00c5 resolution. It reveals the organization of the individual subunits and their interactions with components of the 43S complex. We were able to build near-complete polyalanine-level models of the eIF3 PCI/MPN core and of two peripheral subunits. The implications for understanding mRNA ribosomal attachment and scanning are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "During protein synthesis, elongation of the polypeptide chain by each amino acid is followed by a translocation step in which mRNA and transfer RNA (tRNA) are advanced by one codon. This crucial step is catalyzed by elongation factor G (EF-G), a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase), and accompanied by a rotation between the two ribosomal subunits. A mutant of EF-G, H91A, renders the factor impaired in guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis and thereby stabilizes it on the ribosome. We use cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) at near-atomic resolution to investigate two complexes formed by EF-G H91A in its GTP state with the ribosome, distinguished by the presence or absence of the intersubunit rotation. Comparison of these two structures argues in favor of a direct role of the conserved histidine in the switch II loop of EF-G in GTPase activation, and explains why GTP hydrolysis cannot proceed with EF-G bound to the unrotated form of the ribosome.",

        "Abstract": "Ribosomal subunit association is a key checkpoint in translation initiation but its structural dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we used a recently developed mixing-spraying, time-resolved, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) method to study ribosomal subunit association in the sub-second time range. We have improved this method and increased the cryo-EM data yield by tenfold. Pre-equilibrium states of the association reaction were captured by reacting the mixture of ribosomal subunits for 60\u00a0ms and 140\u00a0ms. We also identified three distinct ribosome conformations in the associated ribosomes. The observed proportions of these conformations are the same in these two time points, suggesting that ribosomes equilibrate among the three conformations within less than 60\u00a0ms upon formation. Our results demonstrate that the mixing-spraying method can capture multiple states of macromolecules during a sub-second reaction. Other fast processes, such as translation initiation, decoding, and ribosome recycling, are amenable to study with this method.",

        "Abstract": "Single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful tool for the study of macromolecular structures at high resolution. Classification allows multiple structural states to be extracted and reconstructed from the same sample. One classification approach is via the covariance matrix, which captures the correlation between every pair of voxels. Earlier approaches employ computing-intensive resampling and estimate only the eigenvectors of the matrix, which are then used in a separate fast classification step. We propose an iterative scheme to explicitly estimate the covariance matrix in its entirety. In our approach, the flexibility in choosing the solution domain allows us to examine a part of the molecule in greater detail. Three-dimensional covariance maps obtained in this way from experimental data (cryo-EM images of the eukaryotic pre-initiation complex) prove to be in excellent agreement with conclusions derived by using traditional approaches, revealing in addition the interdependencies of ligand bindings and structural changes.",

In this work the authors describe the \"CTF Estimation Challenge\", called by the Madrid Instruct Image Processing Center (I2PC) in collaboration with the National Center for Macromolecular Imaging (NCMI) at Houston. Correcting for the effects of the CTF requires accurate knowledge of the CTF parameters, but these have often been difficult to determine. In this challenge, researchers have had the opportunity to test their ability in estimating some of the key parameters of the electron microscope CTF on a large micrograph data set produced by well-known laboratories on a wide set of experimental conditions. This work presents the first analysis of the results of the CTF Estimation Challenge, including an assessment of the performance of the different software packages under different conditions, so as to identify those areas of research where further developments would be desirable in order to achieve high-resolution structural information.",

        "Abstract": "At equilibrium, thermodynamic and kinetic information can be extracted from biomolecular energy landscapes by many techniques. However, while static, ensemble techniques yield thermodynamic data, often only dynamic, single-molecule techniques can yield the kinetic data that describe transition-state energy barriers. Here we present a generalized framework based upon dwell-time distributions that can be used to connect such static, ensemble techniques with dynamic, single-molecule techniques, and thus characterize energy landscapes to greater resolutions. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by applying it to cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) studies of the bacterial ribosomal pre-translocation complex. Among other benefits, application of this framework to these data explains why two transient, intermediate conformations of the pre-translocation complex, which are observed in a cryo-EM study, may not be observed in several smFRET studies.",

        "Abstract": "Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) mediate the rapid release of calcium (Ca(2+)) from intracellular stores into the cytosol, which is essential for numerous cellular functions including excitation-contraction coupling in muscle. Lack of sufficient structural detail has impeded understanding of RyR gating and regulation. Here we report the closed-state structure of the 2.3-megadalton complex of the rabbit skeletal muscle type 1 RyR (RyR1), solved by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at an overall resolution of 4.8\u00a0\u00c5. We fitted a polyalanine-level model to all 3,757 ordered residues in each protomer, defining the transmembrane pore in unprecedented detail and placing all cytosolic domains as tertiary folds. The cytosolic assembly is built on an extended \u03b1-solenoid scaffold connecting key regulatory domains to the pore. The RyR1 pore architecture places it in the six-transmembrane ion channel superfamily. A unique domain inserted between the second and third transmembrane helices interacts intimately with paired EF-hands originating from the \u03b1-solenoid scaffold, suggesting a mechanism for channel gating by Ca(2+).",

We start the classification with more number of classes than anticipated based on prior knowledge, and then combine the classes that yield similar reconstructions. The classes yielding similar reconstructions can be identified from the migrating particles (jumpers) during consecutive iterations after the iteration of convergence. We therefore termed the method \"jumper analysis\", and applied it to the output of RELION 3D classification of a benchmark experimental dataset. This work is a step forward toward fully automated single-particle reconstruction and classification of cryo-EM data.",

        "Abstract": "A Brownian machine, a tiny device buffeted by the random motions of molecules in the environment, is capable of exploiting these thermal motions for many of the conformational changes in its work cycle. Such machines are now thought to be ubiquitous, with the ribosome, a molecular machine responsible for protein synthesis, increasingly regarded as prototypical. Here we present a new analytical approach capable of determining the free-energy landscape and the continuous trajectories of molecular machines from a large number of snapshots obtained by cryogenic electron microscopy. We demonstrate this approach in the context of experimental cryogenic electron microscope images of a large ensemble of nontranslating ribosomes purified from yeast cells. The free-energy landscape is seen to contain a closed path of low energy, along which the ribosome exhibits conformational changes known to be associated with the elongation cycle. Our approach allows model-free quantitative analysis of the degrees of freedom and the energy landscape underlying continuous conformational changes in nanomachines, including those important for biological function.",

A crucial step in automating single-particle reconstruction of a biological sample is the selection of particle images from a micrograph.

        "Abstract": "ABC-F proteins have evaded functional characterization even though they compose one of the most widely distributed branches of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. Herein, we demonstrate that YjjK, the most prevalent eubacterial ABC-F protein, gates ribosome entry into the translation elongation cycle through a nucleotide-dependent interaction sensitive to ATP/ADP ratio. Accordingly, we rename this protein energy-dependent translational throttle A (EttA). We determined the crystal structure of Escherichia coli EttA and used it to design mutants for biochemical studies including enzymological assays of the initial steps of protein synthesis. These studies suggest that EttA may regulate protein synthesis in energy-depleted cells, which have a low ATP/ADP ratio. Consistently with this inference, EttA-deleted cells exhibit a severe fitness defect in long-term stationary phase. These studies demonstrate that an ABC-F protein regulates protein synthesis via a new mechanism sensitive to cellular energy status.",

Here, we elucidate the mechanism of a newly characterized regulatory translation factor, energy-dependent translational throttle A (EttA), which is an Escherichia coli representative of the ATP-binding cassette F (ABC-F) protein family. Using cryo-EM, we demonstrate that the ATP-bound form of EttA binds to the ribosomal tRNA-exit site, where it forms bridging interactions between the ribosomal L1 stalk and the tRNA bound in the peptidyl-tRNA-binding site. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we show that the ATP-bound form of EttA restricts ribosome and tRNA dynamics required for protein synthesis. This work represents the first example, to our knowledge, in which the detailed molecular mechanism of any ABC-F family protein has been determined and establishes a framework for elucidating the mechanisms of other regulatory translation factors.",

        "Title": "Hepatitis-C-virus-like internal ribosome entry sites displace eIF3 to gain access to the 40S subunit.",
        "Abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) messenger RNAs contain related (HCV-like) internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) that promote 5'-end independent initiation of translation, requiring only a subset of the eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) needed for canonical initiation on cellular mRNAs. Initiation on HCV-like IRESs relies on their specific interaction with the 40S subunit, which places the initiation codon into the P site, where it directly base-pairs with eIF2-bound initiator methionyl transfer RNA to form a 48S initiation complex. However, all HCV-like IRESs also specifically interact with eIF3 (refs 2, 5-7, 9-12), but the role of this interaction in IRES-mediated initiation has remained unknown. During canonical initiation, eIF3 binds to the 40S subunit as a component of the 43S pre-initiation complex, and comparison of the ribosomal positions of eIF3 and the HCV IRES revealed that they overlap, so that their rearrangement would be required for formation of ribosomal complexes containing both components. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a 40S ribosomal complex containing eIF3 and the CSFV IRES. Remarkably, although the position and interactions of the CSFV IRES with the 40S subunit in this complex are similar to those of the HCV IRES in the 40S-IRES binary complex, eIF3 is completely displaced from its ribosomal position in the 43S complex, and instead interacts through its ribosome-binding surface exclusively with the apical region of domain III of the IRES. Our results suggest a role for the specific interaction of HCV-like IRESs with eIF3 in preventing ribosomal association of eIF3, which could serve two purposes: relieving the competition between the IRES and eIF3 for a common binding site on the 40S subunit, and reducing formation of 43S complexes, thereby favouring translation of viral mRNAs.",

        "Abstract": "Termination of messenger RNA translation in Bacteria and Archaea is initiated by release factors (RFs) 1 or 2 recognizing a stop codon in the ribosomal A site and releasing the peptide from the P-site transfer RNA. After release, RF-dissociation is facilitated by the G-protein RF3. Structures of ribosomal complexes with RF1 or RF2 alone or with RF3 alone-RF3 bound to a non-hydrolyzable GTP-analog-have been reported. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of a post-termination ribosome containing both apo-RF3 and RF1. The conformation of RF3 is distinct from those of free RF3\u2022GDP and ribosome-bound RF3\u2022GDP(C/N)P. Furthermore, the conformation of RF1 differs from those observed in RF3-lacking ribosomal complexes. Our study provides structural keys to the mechanism of guanine nucleotide exchange on RF3 and to an L12-mediated ribosomal recruitment of RF3. In conjunction with previous observations, our data provide the foundation to structurally characterize the complete action cycle of the G-protein RF3.

        "Title": "Structure of the mammalian ribosomal 43S preinitiation complex bound to the scanning factor DHX29.",
        "Abstract": "Eukaryotic translation initiation begins with assembly of a 43S preinitiation complex. First, methionylated initiator methionine transfer RNA (Met-tRNAi(Met)), eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2, and guanosine triphosphate form a ternary complex (TC). The TC, eIF3, eIF1, and eIF1A cooperatively bind to the 40S subunit, yielding the 43S preinitiation complex, which is ready to attach to messenger RNA (mRNA) and start scanning to the initiation codon. Scanning on structured mRNAs additionally requires DHX29, a DExH-box protein that also binds directly to the 40S subunit. Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the mammalian DHX29-bound 43S complex at 11.6\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. It reveals that eIF2 interacts with the 40S subunit via its \u03b1 subunit and supports Met-tRNAi(Met) in an unexpected P/I orientation (eP/I). The structural core of eIF3 resides on the back of the 40S subunit, establishing two principal points of contact, whereas DHX29 binds around helix 16. The structure provides insights into eukaryote-specific aspects of translation, including the mechanism of action of DHX29.",

Here, we present an atomic model of the Tet(O)-bound 70S ribosome based on our cryo-electron microscopic reconstruction at 9.6-\u00c5 resolution. This atomic model allowed us to identify the Tet(O)-ribosome binding sites, which involve three characteristic loops in domain 4 of Tet(O). Replacements of the three amino-acid tips of these loops by a single glycine residue result in loss of Tet(O)-mediated tetracycline resistance. On the basis of these findings, the mechanism of Tet(O)-mediated tetracycline resistance can be explained in molecular detail.",

        "Title": "High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the Trypanosoma brucei ribosome.",
        "Abstract": "Ribosomes, the protein factories of living cells, translate genetic information carried by messenger RNAs into proteins, and are thus involved in virtually all aspects of cellular development and maintenance. The few available structures of the eukaryotic ribosome reveal that it is more complex than its prokaryotic counterpart, owing mainly to the presence of eukaryote-specific ribosomal proteins and additional ribosomal RNA insertions, called expansion segments. The structures also differ among species, partly in the size and arrangement of these expansion segments. Such differences are extreme in kinetoplastids, unicellular eukaryotic parasites often infectious to humans. Here we present a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the ribosome of Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that is transmitted by the tsetse fly and that causes African sleeping sickness. The atomic model reveals the unique features of this ribosome, characterized mainly by the presence of unusually large expansion segments and ribosomal-protein extensions leading to the formation of four additional inter-subunit bridges. We also find additional rRNA insertions, including one large rRNA domain that is not found in other eukaryotes. Furthermore, the structure reveals the five cleavage sites of the kinetoplastid large ribosomal subunit (LSU) rRNA chain, which is known to be cleaved uniquely into six pieces, and suggests that the cleavage is important for the maintenance of the T. brucei ribosome in the observed structure. We discuss several possible implications of the large rRNA expansion segments for the translation-regulation process. The structure could serve as a basis for future experiments aimed at understanding the functional importance of these kinetoplastid-specific ribosomal features in protein-translation regulation, an essential step towards finding effective and safe kinetoplastid-specific drugs.",

In this study, utilizing AG, we show that His-tagged activated PKC \u03b2II binds to the small ribosomal subunit (40S). We reconstructed a cryo-EM map which shows that PKC \u03b2II interacts with RACK1, a seven-bladed \u03b2-propeller protein present on the 40S and binds in two different regions close to blades 3 and 4 of RACK1.

Here, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and flexible fitting, we determined the structure of eRF1-eRF3-guanosine 5'-[\u03b2,\u03b3-imido]triphosphate (GMPPNP)-bound ribosomal pretermination complex (pre-TC), which corresponds to the initial, pre-GTP hydrolysis stage of factor attachment. Our results show that eukaryotic translation termination involves a network of interactions between the two release factors and the ribosome. Our structure provides mechanistic insight into the coordination between GTP hydrolysis by eRF3 and subsequent peptide release by eRF1.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies support the notion that the pre-translocation (PRE) ribosomal complex functions, at least in part, as a Brownian machine, stochastically fluctuating among multiple conformations and transfer RNA (tRNA) binding configurations. Apart from the relatively more energetically stable conformational states of the PRE complex, termed macrostate I (MS I) and macrostate II (MS II), several additional intermediate states have been recently discovered. Structural and kinetic analyses of these states, made possible by cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), X-ray crystallography, and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET), have provided important insights into the translocation process, which is now understood to proceed, at least in the first step of the process, as a Brownian machine that is transiently stabilized in the 'productive' MS II conformation by the binding of the translocase elongation factor G (EF-G).",

        "Abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosomes are preassembled in the nucleus and mature in the cytoplasm. Release of the antiassociation factor Tif6 by the translocase-like guanosine triphosphatase Efl1 is a critical late maturation step. In this paper, we show that a loop of Rpl10 that embraces the P-site transfer ribonucleic acid was required for release of Tif6, 90 \u00c5 away. Mutations in this P-site loop blocked 60S maturation but were suppressed by mutations in Tif6 or Efl1. Molecular dynamics simulations of the mutant Efl1 proteins suggest that they promote a conformation change in Efl1 equivalent to changes that elongation factor G and eEF2 undergo during translocation. These results identify molecular signaling from the P-site to Tif6 via Efl1, suggesting that the integrity of the P-site is interrogated during maturation. We propose that Efl1 promotes a functional check of the integrity of the 60S subunit before its first round of translation.",

The results are consistent with the view of the ribosome as a molecular machine employing Brownian motion to reach a functionally productive state via a series of substates with incremental changes in conformation.",

At the workshop, a group of scientists involved in collecting electron microscopy data, using the data to determine three-dimensional electron microscopy (3DEM) density maps, and building molecular models into the maps explored how to assess maps, models, and other data that are deposited into the Electron Microscopy Data Bank and Protein Data Bank public data archives. The specific recommendations resulting from the workshop aim to increase the impact of 3DEM in biology and medicine.",

A reference volume, however, is not always available and compiling a set of reference projections from the micrographs themselves requires significant effort to attain the same level of accuracy. We propose a reference-free method to quickly extract particles from the micrograph. The method is augmented with a new semi-supervised machine-learning algorithm to accurately discriminate particles from contaminants and noise.",

This process is facilitated by a ribonucleoprotein complex composed of transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA)-a chimera made of a tRNA-like molecule and a short open reading frame (ORF) -and small protein B (SmpB). Determination of the structure of tmRNA and SmpB in complex with the ribosome, at the stage when translation has resumed on tmRNA, has provided an increased understanding of the structure of tmRNA as it transits the ribosome, and unique insights into the complex mechanism of template switching on the ribosome and SmpB-driven selection of the correct reading frame on tmRNA's ORF.",

The need to characterize each of the substrates with sufficient resolution entails a large increase in the data flow and motivates the development of more effective automated particle selection algorithms. Concepts and procedures from the machine-learning field are increasingly employed toward this end. However, a review of recent literature has revealed a discrepancy in terminology of the performance scores used to compare particle selection algorithms, and this has subsequently led to ambiguities in the meaning of claimed performance. In an attempt to curtail the perpetuation of this confusion and to disentangle past mistakes, we review the performance of published particle selection efforts with a set of explicitly defined performance scores using the terminology established and accepted within the field of machine learning.",

        "Abstract": "The structural basis of the tRNA selection process is investigated by cryo-electron microscopy of ribosomes programmed with UGA codons and incubated with ternary complex (TC) containing the near-cognate Trp-tRNA(Trp) in the presence of kirromycin. Going through more than 350 000 images and employing image classification procedures, we find \u223c8% in which the TC is bound to the ribosome. The reconstructed 3D map provides a means to characterize the arrangement of the near-cognate aa-tRNA with respect to elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and the ribosome, as well as the domain movements of the ribosome. One of the interesting findings is that near-cognate tRNA's acceptor stem region is flexible and CCA end becomes disordered. The data bring direct structural insights into the induced-fit mechanism of decoding by the ribosome, as the analysis of the interactions between small and large ribosomal subunit, aa-tRNA and EF-Tu and comparison with the cognate case (UGG codon) offers clues on how the conformational signals conveyed to the GTPase differ in the two cases.",

        "Title": "Molecular dynamics of EF-G during translocation.",
        "Abstract": "Elongation factor G (EF-G) plays a crucial role in two stages of mRNA-(tRNA)(2) translocation. First, EF-G\u2022GTP enters the pre-translocational ribosome in its intersubunit-rotated state, with tRNAs in their hybrid (P/E and A/P) positions. Second, a conformational change in EF-G's Domain IV induced by GTP hydrolysis disengages the mRNA-anticodon stem-loops of the tRNAs from the decoding center to advance relative to the small subunit when the ribosome undergoes a backward inter-subunit rotation. These events take place as EF-G undergoes a series of large conformational changes as visualized by cryo-EM and X-ray studies. The number and variety of these structures leave open many questions on how these different configurations form during the dynamic translocation process. To understand the molecular mechanism of translocation, we examined the molecular motions of EF-G in solution by means of molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show: (1) rotations of the super-domain formed by Domains III-V with respect to the super-domain formed by I-II, and rotations of Domain IV with respect to Domain III; (2) flexible conformations of both 503- and 575-loops; (3) large conformational variability in the bound form caused by the interaction between Domain V and the GTPase-associated center; (4) after GTP hydrolysis, the Switch I region seems to be instrumental for effecting the conformational change at the end of Domain IV implicated in the disengagement of the codon-anticodon helix from the decoding center.",

        "Abstract": "Adherens junctions, which play a central role in intercellular adhesion, comprise clusters of type I classical cadherins that bind via extracellular domains extended from opposing cell surfaces. We show that a molecular layer seen in crystal structures of E- and N-cadherin ectodomains reported here and in a previous C-cadherin structure corresponds to the extracellular architecture of adherens junctions. In all three ectodomain crystals, cadherins dimerize through a trans adhesive interface and are connected by a second, cis, interface. Assemblies formed by E-cadherin ectodomains coated on liposomes also appear to adopt this structure. Fluorescent imaging of junctions formed from wild-type and mutant E-cadherins in cultured cells confirm conclusions derived from structural evidence. Mutations that interfere with the trans interface ablate adhesion, whereas cis interface mutations disrupt stable junction formation. Our observations are consistent with a model for junction assembly involving strong trans and weak cis interactions localized in the ectodomain.",

        "Abstract": "Group II self-splicing introns are phylogenetically diverse retroelements that are widely held to be the ancestors of spliceosomal introns and retrotransposons that insert into DNA. Folding of group II intron RNA is often guided by an intron-encoded protein to form a catalytically active ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that plays a key role in the activity of the intron. To date, possible structural differences between the intron RNP in its precursor and spliced forms remain unexplored. In this work, we have trapped the native Lactococcus lactis group II intron RNP complex in its precursor form, by deleting the adenosine nucleophile that initiates splicing. Sedimentation velocity, size-exclusion chromatography and cryo-electron microscopy provide the first glimpse of the intron RNP precursor as a large, loosely packed structure. The dimensions contrast with those of compact spliced introns, implying that the RNP undergoes a dramatic conformational change to achieve the catalytically active state.",

        "Abstract": "Bacterial ribosomes stalled by truncated mRNAs are rescued by transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), a dual-function molecule that contains a tRNA-like domain (TLD) and an internal open reading frame (ORF). Occupying the empty A site with its TLD, the tmRNA enters the ribosome with the help of elongation factor Tu and a protein factor called small protein B (SmpB), and switches the translation to its own ORF. In this study, using cryo-electron microscopy, we obtained the first structure of an in vivo-formed complex containing ribosome and the tmRNA at the point where the TLD is accommodated into the ribosomal P site. We show that tmRNA maintains a stable 'arc and fork' structure on the ribosome when its TLD moves to the ribosomal P site and translation resumes on its ORF. Based on the density map, we built an atomic model, which suggests that SmpB interacts with the five nucleotides immediately upstream of the resume codon, thereby determining the correct selection of the reading frame on the ORF of tmRNA.",

        "Abstract": "In single-particle reconstruction methods, projections of macromolecules at random orientations are collected. Often, several classes of conformations or binding states coexist in a biological sample, which requires classification, so that each conformation can be reconstructed separately. In this work, we examine bootstrap techniques for classifying the projection data. When these techniques are applied to variance estimation, the projection images (particles) are randomly sampled with replacement from the data set and a bootstrap volume is reconstructed from each sample. In a recent extension of the bootstrap technique to classification, each particle is assigned to a volume in the space spanned by the bootstrap volumes, such that the projection of the assigned volume best matches the particle. In this work we explain the rationale of these techniques by discussing the nature of the bootstrap volumes and provide some statistical analyses.",

The classical Raleigh criterion for the resolution is not applicable in this case, and the resolution is commonly defined by a consistency test, whereby the data set is randomly split in half and the two resulting reconstructions are then compared. Such a procedure, however, may introduce statistical dependence between the two half-sets, which leads to a too optimistic resolution estimate. On the other hand, this overestimation is counteracted by the diminished statistical properties of a mere half of the data set. The \"true\" resolution of the whole data set can be estimated when the functional relationship between the data size and the resolution is known. We are able to estimate this functional by taking into account the B-factor and the geometry of data collection. Finally, the drawbacks of resolution estimation are entirely avoided by computing the correlation of neighboring voxels in the Fourier domain.",

        "Title": "Characterization of the nuclear export adaptor protein Nmd3 in association with the 60S ribosomal subunit.",
        "Abstract": "The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein Nmd3 is an adaptor for export of the 60S ribosomal subunit from the nucleus. Nmd3 binds to nascent 60S subunits in the nucleus and recruits the export receptor Crm1 to facilitate passage through the nuclear pore complex. In this study, we present a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of the 60S subunit in complex with Nmd3 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The density corresponding to Nmd3 is directly visible in the cryo-EM map and is attached to the regions around helices 38, 69, and 95 of the 25S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), the helix 95 region being adjacent to the protein Rpl10. We identify the intersubunit side of the large subunit as the binding site for Nmd3. rRNA protection experiments corroborate the structural data. Furthermore, Nmd3 binding to 60S subunits is blocked in 80S ribosomes, which is consistent with the assigned binding site on the subunit joining face. This cryo-EM map is a first step toward a molecular understanding of the functional role and release mechanism of Nmd3.",

Over the past decade, the field of structural biology has made significant advances in the visualisation of the molecular machinery involved in protein synthesis. It is now possible to discern, at least in outline, the way that interlocking ribosomal components and factors adapt their conformations throughout this process.

The elucidation of the structural and mechanistic aspects of PSII keeps scientists all over the world engaged since several decades. In this Minireview, we outline the progress in understanding PSII based on the most recent crystal structure at 2.9 A resolution. A likely position of the chloride ion, which is known to be required for the fast turnover of water oxidation, could be determined in native PSII and is compared with work on bromide and iodide substituted PSII. Moreover, eleven new integral lipids could be assigned, emphasizing the importance of lipids for the perfect function of PSII. A third plastoquinone molecule (Q(C)) and a second quinone transfer channel are revealed, making it possible to consider different mechanisms for the exchange of plastoquinone/plastoquinol molecules. In addition, possible transport channels for water, dioxygen and protons are identified.",

This mechanistic paradigm implies that a free-energy landscape governs the conformational states that are accessible to and sampled by the translating ribosome. This scenario presents interdependent opportunities and challenges for structural and dynamic studies of protein synthesis. Indeed, the synergism between cryogenic electron microscopic and X-ray crystallographic structural studies, on the one hand, and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) dynamic studies, on the other, is emerging as a powerful means for investigating the complex free-energy landscape of the translating ribosome and uncovering the mechanisms that direct the stochastic conformational fluctuations of the translational machinery. In this review, we highlight the principal insights obtained from cryogenic electron microscopic, X-ray crystallographic, and smFRET studies of the elongation stage of protein synthesis and outline the emerging themes, questions, and challenges that lie ahead in mechanistic studies of translation.",

The protein elongation cycle, during which the tRNAs traverse the ribosome in a coordinated manner along a path of more than 100 A, is facilitated by large-scale rearrangements of the ribosome. These rearrangements go hand in hand with conformational changes of tRNA as well as elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G - GTPases that catalyze tRNA delivery and translocation, respectively. This review focuses on the structural data related to the dynamics of the ribosomal machinery, which are the basis, in conjunction with existing biochemical, kinetic, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer data, of our knowledge of the decoding and translocation steps of protein elongation.",

Eukaryotic ribosomes possess more ribosomal proteins and ribosomal RNA than do bacterial ribosomes, which are implicated in extraribosomal functions in the eukaryotic cells. By combining cryo-EM with RNA and protein homology modeling, we obtained an atomic model of the yeast 80S ribosome complete with all ribosomal RNA expansion segments and all ribosomal proteins for which a structural homolog can be identified. Mutation or deletion of 80S ribosomal proteins can abrogate maturation of the ribosome, leading to several human diseases. We have localized one such protein unique to eukaryotes, rpS19e, whose mutations are associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia in humans. Additionally, we characterize crucial interactions between the dynamic stalk base of the ribosome with eukaryotic elongation factor 2.",

        "Abstract": "Helix 38 (H38) of the large ribosomal subunit, with a length of 110 A, reaches the small subunit through intersubunit bridge B1a. Previous cryo-EM studies revealed that the tip of H38 moves by more than 10 A from the non-ratcheted to the ratcheted state of the ribosome while mutational studies implicated a key role of flexible H38 in attenuation of translocation and in dynamical signaling between ribosomal functional centers. We investigate a region including the elbow-shaped kink-turn (Kt-38) in the Haloarcula marismortui archaeal ribosome, and equivalently positioned elbows in three eubacterial species, located at the H38 base. We performed explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations on the H38 elbows in all four species. They are formed by at first sight unrelated sequences resulting in diverse base interactions but built with the same overall topology, as shown by X-ray crystallography. The elbows display similar fluctuations and intrinsic flexibilities in simulations indicating that the eubacterial H38 elbows are structural and dynamical analogs of archaeal Kt-38. We suggest that this structural element plays a pivotal role in the large motions of H38 and may act as fulcrum for the abovementioned tip motion. The directional flexibility inferred from simulations correlates well with the cryo-EM results.",

        "Title": "Time-dependent insulin oligomer reaction pathway prior to fibril formation: cooling and seeding.",
        "Abstract": "The difficulty in identifying the toxic agents in all amyloid-related diseases is likely due to the complicated kinetics and thermodynamics of the nucleation process and subsequent fibril formation. The slow progression of these diseases suggests that the formation, incorporation, and/or action of toxic agents are possibly rate limiting. Candidate toxic agents include precursors (some at very low concentrations), also called oligomers and protofibrils, and the fibrils. Here, we investigate the kinetic and thermodynamic behavior of human insulin oligomers (imaged by cryo-EM) under fibril-forming conditions (pH 1.6 and 65 degrees C) by probing the reaction pathway to insulin fibril formation using two different types of experiments-cooling and seeding-and confirm the validity of the nucleation model and its effect on fibril growth. The results from both the cooling and seeding studies confirm the existence of a time-changing oligomer reaction process prior to fibril formation that likely involves a rate-limiting nucleation process followed by structural rearrangements of intermediates (into beta-sheet rich entities) to form oligomers that then form fibrils. The latter structural rearrangement step occurs even in the absence of nuclei (i.e., with added heterologous seeds). Nuclei are formed at the fibrillation conditions (pH 1.6 and 65 degrees C) but are also continuously formed during cooling at pH 1.6 and 25 degrees C. Within the time-scale of the experiments, only after increasing the temperature to 65 degrees C are the trapped insulin nuclei and resultant structures able to induce the structural rearrangement step and overcome the energy barrier to form fibrils. This delay in fibrillation and accumulation of nuclei at low temperature (25 degrees C) result in a decrease in the mean length of the fibers when placed at 65 degrees C. Fits of an empirical model to the data provide quantitative measures of the delay in the lag-time during the nucleation process and subsequent reduction in fibril growth rate resulting from the cooling. Also, the seeding experiments, within the time-scale of the measurements, demonstrate that fibers can initiate fast fibrillation with dissolved insulin (fresh or taken during the lag-period) but not with other fibers. Qualitatively this is explained with a conjectual free-energy space plot.",

        "Abstract": "Attempts to develop efficient classification approaches to the problem of heterogeneity in single-particle reconstruction of macromolecules require phantom data with realistic noise models. We have estimated the signal-to-noise ratios and spectral signal-to-noise ratios for three steps in the electron microscopic image formation from data obtained experimentally. An important result is that structural noise, i.e., the irreproducible component of the object prior to image formation, is substantial, and of the same order of magnitude as the reproducible signal. Based on this result, the noise modeling for testing new classification techniques can be improved.",

        "Abstract": "Pre-mRNA 3' end formation is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression. Over half of human genes produce alternatively polyadenylated mRNAs, suggesting that regulated polyadenylation is an important mechanism for posttranscriptional gene control. Although a number of mammalian mRNA 3' processing factors have been identified, the full protein composition of the 3' processing machinery has not been determined, and its structure is unknown. Here we report the purification and subsequent proteomic and structural characterization of human mRNA 3' processing complexes. Remarkably, the purified 3' processing complex contains approximately 85 proteins, including known and new core 3' processing factors and over 50 proteins that may mediate crosstalk with other processes. Electron microscopic analyses show that the core 3' processing complex has a distinct \"kidney\" shape and is approximately 250 A in length. Together, our data has revealed the complexity and molecular architecture of the pre-mRNA 3' processing complex.",

The GTPase activity of EF-Tu is triggered by ribosome-induced conformational changes of the factor that play a pivotal role in the selection of the cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs. We present a 6.7-A cryo-electron microscopy map of the aminoacyl-tRNA x EF-Tu x GDP x kirromycin-bound Escherichia coli ribosome, together with an atomic model of the complex obtained through molecular dynamics flexible fitting. The model reveals the conformational changes in the conserved GTPase switch regions of EF-Tu that trigger hydrolysis of GTP, along with key interactions, including those between the sarcin-ricin loop and the P loop of EF-Tu, and between the effector loop of EF-Tu and a conserved region of the 16S rRNA.

Using a rapid motif search algorithm with a reference motif of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) provided by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, 49 receptors were located in five tomograms. Following co-alignment of the receptors and division into quadrants centered on the 4-fold symmetry axis, the receptors were classified using multivariate statistics. Global and class averages reveal that the SR membrane in the vicinity of the receptor is highly curved, creating an open vestibule with a gap of 4nm between the receptor pore and the calsequestrin layer in the SR lumen. The in-plane densities in the calsequestrin layer have paracrystalline order, consistent with the packing of calsequestrin dimers in the three-dimensional crystal structure. Faint densities (\"tethers\") extend to the calsequestrin layer from densities in the SR membrane located 15nm from the symmetry axis of the RyR. In a class average of RyRs with proximal transverse tubules (TT), a cytoplasmic density is observed near the receptor that could represent the most consistent location of tethers observed in tomograms between the SR and TT membranes.",

        "Abstract": "The accuracy of ribosomal translation is achieved by an initial selection and a proofreading step, mediated by EF-Tu, which forms a ternary complex with aminoacyl(aa)-tRNA. To study the binding modes of different aa-tRNAs, we compared cryo-EM maps of the kirromycin-stalled ribosome bound with ternary complexes containing Phe-tRNA(Phe), Trp-tRNA(Trp), or Leu-tRNA(LeuI). The three maps suggest a common binding manner of cognate aa-tRNAs in their specific binding with both the ribosome and EF-Tu. All three aa-tRNAs have the same 'loaded spring' conformation with a kink and twist between the D-stem and anticodon stem. The three complexes are similarly integrated in an interaction network, extending from the anticodon loop through h44 and protein S12 to the EF-Tu-binding CCA end of aa-tRNA, proposed to signal cognate codon-anticodon interaction to the GTPase centre and tune the accuracy of aa-tRNA selection.",

        "Abstract": "A crucial step in translation is the translocation of tRNAs through the ribosome. In the transition from one canonical site to the other, the tRNAs acquire intermediate configurations, so-called hybrid states. At this stage, the small subunit is rotated with respect to the large subunit, and the anticodon stem loops reside in the A and P sites of the small subunit, while the acceptor ends interact with the P and E sites of the large subunit. In this work, by means of cryo-EM and particle classification procedures, we visualize the hybrid state of both A/P and P/E tRNAs in an authentic factor-free ribosome complex during translocation. In addition, we show how the repositioning of the tRNAs goes hand in hand with the change in the interplay between S13, L1 stalk, L5, H68, H69, and H38 that is caused by the ratcheting of the small subunit.",

        "Abstract": "In an attempt to understand ribosome-induced GTP hydrolysis on eEF2, we determined a 12.6-A cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the eEF2-bound 80S ribosome in the presence of aluminum tetrafluoride and GDP, with aluminum tetrafluoride mimicking the gamma-phosphate during hydrolysis. This is the first visualization of a structure representing a transition-state complex on the ribosome. Tight interactions are observed between the factor's G domain and the large ribosomal subunit, as well as between domain IV and an intersubunit bridge. In contrast, some of the domains of eEF2 implicated in small subunit binding display a large degree of flexibility. Furthermore, we find support for a transition-state model conformation of the switch I region in this complex where the reoriented switch I region interacts with a conserved rRNA region of the 40S subunit formed by loops of the 18S RNA helices 8 and 14. This complex is structurally distinct from the eEF2-bound 80S ribosome complexes previously reported, and analysis of this map sheds light on the GTPase-coupled translocation mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "As collection of electron microscopy data for single-particle reconstruction becomes more efficient, due to electronic image capture, one of the principal limiting steps in a reconstruction remains particle-verification, which is especially costly in terms of user input. Recently, some algorithms have been developed to window particles automatically, but the resulting particle sets typically need to be verified manually. Here we describe a procedure to speed up verification of windowed particles using multivariate data analysis and classification. In this procedure, the particle set is subjected to multi-reference alignment before the verification. The aligned particles are first binned according to orientation and are binned further by K-means classification. Rather than selection of particles individually, an entire class of particles can be selected, with an option to remove outliers. Since particles in the same class present the same view, distinction between good and bad images becomes more straightforward. We have also developed a graphical interface, written in Python/Tkinter, to facilitate this implementation of particle-verification. For the demonstration of the particle-verification scheme presented here, electron micrographs of ribosomes are used.",

The parameters examined were pixel size, window size, and mode of Fourier amplitude enhancement at high spatial frequencies. In addition, the strategy of switching from large to small pixel size during angular refinement was explored. The relationship between resolution (in Fourier space) and the number of particles was observed to follow a lin-log dependence, a relationship that appears to hold for other data, as well. By optimizing the above parameters, and using a lin-log extrapolation to the full data set in the estimation of resolution from half-sets, we obtained a 3D map from 131,599 ribosome particles at 6.7A resolution (FSC=0.5).",

The simulations incorporate the EM data as an external potential added to the molecular dynamics force field, allowing all internal features present in the EM map to be used in the fitting process, while the model remains fully flexible and stereochemically correct. The molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) method is validated for available crystal structures of protein and RNA in different conformations; measures to assess and monitor the fitting process are introduced. The MDFF method is then used to obtain high-resolution structures of the E. coli ribosome in different functional states imaged by cryo-EM.",

First, it describes how to create a grid surface coated with holey carbon by first inducing holes in a Formvar film to act as a template for the holey carbon that is stable under cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) conditions and is sample-friendly. The protocol then describes the steps required to deposit the homogeneous sample on the grid and to plunge-freeze the grid into liquid ethane at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, so that it is suitable for cryo-EM visualization. It takes 4-5 h to make several hundred holey carbon grids and about 1 h to make the frozen-hydrated grids. The time required for sample purification varies from hours to days, depending on the sample and the specific procedure required. A companion protocol details how to collect cryo-EM data using an FEI Tecnai transmission electron microscope that can subsequently be processed to obtain a three-dimensional reconstruction of the macromolecular complex.",

        "Title": "Specific interaction between EF-G and RRF and its implication for GTP-dependent ribosome splitting into subunits.",
        "Abstract": "After termination of protein synthesis, the bacterial ribosome is split into its 30S and 50S subunits by the action of ribosome recycling factor (RRF) and elongation factor G (EF-G) in a guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-hydrolysis-dependent manner. Based on a previous cryo-electron microscopy study of ribosomal complexes, we have proposed that the binding of EF-G to an RRF-containing posttermination ribosome triggers an interdomain rotation of RRF, which destabilizes two strong intersubunit bridges (B2a and B3) and, ultimately, separates the two subunits. Here, we present a 9-A (Fourier shell correlation cutoff of 0.5) cryo-electron microscopy map of a 50S x EF-G x guanosine 5'-[(betagamma)-imido]triphosphate x RRF complex and a quasi-atomic model derived from it, showing the interaction between EF-G and RRF on the 50S subunit in the presence of the noncleavable GTP analogue guanosine 5'-[(betagamma)-imido]triphosphate. The detailed information in this model and a comparative analysis of EF-G structures in various nucleotide- and ribosome-bound states show how rotation of the RRF head domain may be triggered by various domains of EF-G. For validation of our structural model, all known mutations in EF-G and RRF that relate to ribosome recycling have been taken into account. More importantly, our results indicate a substantial conformational change in the Switch I region of EF-G, suggesting that a conformational signal transduction mechanism, similar to that employed in transfer RNA translocation on the ribosome by EF-G, translates a large-scale movement of EF-G's domain IV, induced by GTP hydrolysis, into the domain rotation of RRF that eventually splits the ribosome into subunits.",

        "Abstract": "Transfer RNA (tRNA) transiently occupies the hybrid P/E state (P/E-tRNA) when mRNA-tRNA are translocated in the ribosome. In this study, we characterize the structure of P/E-tRNA and its interactions with the ribosome by correlating the results from molecular dynamics simulations on free tRNA with the cryo-EM map of P/E-tRNA. In our approach, we show that the cryo-EM map may be interpreted as a conformational average. Along the molecular dynamics trajectories (44 ns, 18 ns, and 18 ns), some of the snapshots prove to be quite close to the observed density. In a representative structure, the CCA (3') arm is uniquely twisted, and the anticodon stem loop is kinked at the junctions to both the anticodon loop and the D stem. In addition, the map shows that the P/E-tRNA is no longer bound to helix H69 of 23S rRNA and is flexible, and the conformations of helices H68 and h44 of 16S rRNA differ from those in the x-ray structure. Thus, our study presents structural and dynamic information on the P/E-tRNA and characterizes its interactions with the translocating ribosome.",

We present the crystal structure of E. coli RF3*GDP, which has a three-domain architecture strikingly similar to the structure of EF-Tu*GTP. Biochemical data on RF3 mutants show that a surface region involving domains II and III is important for distinct steps in the action cycle of RF3. Furthermore, we present a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the posttermination ribosome bound with RF3 in the GTP form. Our data show that RF3*GTP binding induces large conformational changes in the ribosome, which break the interactions of the class I RF with both the decoding center and the GTPase-associated center of the ribosome, apparently leading to the release of the class I RF.",

        "Abstract": "On the basis of kinetic data on ribosome protein synthesis, the mechanical energy for translocation of the mRNA-tRNA complex is thought to be provided by GTP hydrolysis of an elongation factor (eEF2 in eukaryotes, EF-G in bacteria). We have obtained cryo-EM reconstructions of eukaryotic ribosomes complexed with ADP-ribosylated eEF2 (ADPR-eEF2), before and after GTP hydrolysis, providing a structural basis for analyzing the GTPase-coupled mechanism of translocation. Using the ADP-ribosyl group as a distinct marker, we observe conformational changes of ADPR-eEF2 that are due strictly to GTP hydrolysis. These movements are likely representative of native eEF2 motions in a physiological context and are sufficient to uncouple the mRNA-tRNA complex from two universally conserved bases in the ribosomal decoding center (A1492 and A1493 in Escherichia coli) during translocation. Interpretation of these data provides a detailed two-step model of translocation that begins with the eEF2/EF-G binding-induced ratcheting motion of the small ribosomal subunit. GTP hydrolysis then uncouples the mRNA-tRNA complex from the decoding center so translocation of the mRNA-tRNA moiety may be completed by a head rotation of the small subunit.",

        "Abstract": "Compared to the prokaryotic 70 S ribosome, the eukaryotic 80 S ribosome contains additional ribosomal proteins and extra segments of rRNA, referred to as rRNA expansion segments (ES). These eukaryotic-specific rRNA ES are mainly on the periphery of the 80 S ribosome, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies, but their precise function is not known. To address the question of whether the rRNA ES are structurally conserved among 80 S ribosomes of different fungi we performed cryo-electron microscopy on 80 S ribosomes from the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus and compared it to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 80 S ribosome. Our analysis reveals general structural conservation of the rRNA expansion segments but also changes in ES27 and ES7/39, as well as the absence of a tertiary interaction between ES3 and ES6 in T. lanuginosus. The differences provide a hint on the role of rRNA ES in regulating translation. Furthermore, we show that the stalk region and interactions with elongation factor 2 (eEF2) are different in T. lanuginosus, exhibiting a more extensive contact with domain I of eEF2.",

        "Abstract": "All living organisms utilize ribosomes to translate messenger RNA into proteins. Initiation of translation, the process of bringing together mRNA, initiator transfer RNA, and the ribosome, is therefore of critical importance to all living things. Two protein factors, IF1 (a/eIF1A) and IF2 (a/eIF5B), are conserved among all three kingdoms of life and have been called universal initiation factors (Roll-Mecak et al., 2001). Recent X-ray, NMR and cryo-EM structures of the universal factors, alone and in complex with eubacterial ribosomes, point to the structural homology among the initiation factors and initiation complexes. Taken together with genomic and functional evidence, the structural studies allow us to predict some features of eukaryotic and archaeal initiation complexes. Although initiation of translation in eukaryotes and archaea requires more initiation factors than in eubacteria we propose the existence of a common denominator initiation complex with structural and functional homology across all kingdoms of life.",

        "Abstract": "A eubacterial ribosome stalled on a defective mRNA can be released through a quality control mechanism referred to as trans-translation, which depends on the coordinating binding actions of transfer-messenger RNA, small protein B, and ribosome protein S1. By means of cryo-electron microscopy, we obtained a map of the complex composed of a stalled ribosome and small protein B, which appears near the decoding center. This result suggests that, when lacking a codon, the A-site on the small subunit is a target for small protein B. To investigate the role of S1 played in trans-translation, we obtained a cryo-electron microscopic map, including a stalled ribosome, transfer-messenger RNA, and small protein Bs but in the absence of S1. In this complex, several connections between the 30 S subunit and transfer-messenger RNA that appear in the +S1 complex are no longer found. We propose the unifying concept of scaffolding for the roles of small protein B and S1 in binding of transfer-messenger RNA to the ribosome during trans-translation, and we infer a pathway of sequential binding events in the initial phase of trans-translation.",

Both functions are fulfilled by the 'translocon/translocase', which contains a membrane-embedded protein-conducting channel (PCC) and associated soluble factors that drive translocation and insertion reactions using nucleotide triphosphates as fuel. This perspective focuses on reinterpreting existing experimental data in light of a recently proposed PCC model comprising a front-to-front dimer of SecY or Sec61 heterotrimeric complexes. In this new framework, we propose (i) a revised model for SRP-SR-mediated docking of the ribosome-nascent polypeptide to the PCC; (ii) that the dynamic interplay between protein substrate, soluble factors and PCC controls the opening and closing of a transmembrane channel across, and/or a lateral gate into, the membrane; and (iii) that co- and post-translational translocation, involving the ribosome and SecA, respectively, not only converge at the PCC but also use analogous mechanisms for coordinating protein translocation.",

        "Abstract": "RNA performs a variety of diverse functions and therefore must adopt many different three-dimensional conformations. The number and complexity of RNA structures that are currently available are steadily increasing, necessitating the generation of versatile structure visualization tools. Here, we describe a new RNA secondary and tertiary structure visualization tool, the display program coloRNA. This program colors each nucleotide in a secondary structure schematic according to the value of an assigned property of the corresponding backbone phosphate group, such as the distance between corresponding residues in two atomic models of the same RNA molecule. To assist in analyzing tertiary structure, coloRNA also colors nucleotides based on the three-dimensional distances between a user-selected nucleotide and all others. Minimum and maximum thresholds can be used to focus in on, or eliminate, a particular value range. coloRNA can display a user-specified group of nucleotides by outlining the structure in an automatically assigned, but user-changeable color. As an example, we have used coloRNA to analyze a pair of recently published structures of the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome. When coloRNA is used to display the conformational difference between the two structures, the large movement of the small subunit head stands visually out from the background changes in the remaining domains of the small subunit.",

        "Abstract": "In eubacterial translation, lack of a stop codon on the mRNA results in a defective, potentially toxic polypeptide stalled on the ribosome. Bacteria possess a specialized mRNA, called transfer messenger RNA (tmRNA), to rescue such a stalled system. tmRNA contains a transfer RNA (tRNA)-like domain (TLD), which enters the ribosome as a tRNA and places an ORF into the mRNA channel. This ORF codes for a signal marking the polypeptide for degradation and ends in a stop codon, leading to release of the faulty polypeptide and recycling of the ribosome. The binding of tmRNA to the stalled ribosome is mediated by small protein B (SmpB). By means of cryo-EM, we obtained a density map for the preaccommodated state of the tmRNA.SmpB.EF-Tu.70S ribosome complex with much improved definition for the tmRNA-SmpB complex, showing two SmpB molecules bound per ribosome, one toward the A site on the 30S subunit side and the other bound to the 50S subunit near the GTPase-associated center. tmRNA is strongly attached to the 30S subunit head by multiple contact sites, involving most of its pseudoknots and helices. The map clarifies that the TLD is located near helix 34 and protein S19 of the 30S subunit, rather than in the A site as tRNA for normal translation, so that the TLD is oriented toward the ORF.",

        "Abstract": "SPIRE is a Python program written to modernize the user interaction with SPIDER, the image processing system for electron microscopical reconstruction projects. SPIRE provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to SPIDER for executing batch files of SPIDER commands. It also lets users quickly view the status of a project by showing the last batch files that were run, as well as the data files that were generated. SPIRE handles the flexibility of the SPIDER programming environment through configuration files: XML-tagged documents that describe the batch files, directory trees, and presentation of the GUI for a given type of reconstruction project. It also provides the capability to connect to a laboratory database, for downloading parameters required by batch files at the start of a project, and uploading reconstruction results at the end of a project.",

        "Abstract": "In cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle reconstruction, the heterogeneity of two-dimensional projection image data resulting from the co-existence of different conformational or ligand binding states of a macromolecular complex remains a major obstacle as it impairs the validity of reconstructed density maps and limits the progress toward higher resolution. Classification of cryo-EM data according to the different conformations is difficult because of the coexistence of multiple orientations in a single dataset. Here, we present an unsupervised classification method, termed cluster tracking, which utilizes the continuity in multi-dimensional space induced by angular adjacency of projections in large datasets. In a proof of concept, the testing of cluster tracking on simulated projection data, which were generated from multiple conformations and orientations of an existing volume, produced clusters that are consistent with the conformational identity of the data. The application of the method to experimental cryo-EM projection data is found to result in a partition similar to the one generated by supervised classification.",

The MPI-enabled SPIDER preserves the interactive command line and batch interface used in the sequential version of SPIDER, thus does not require users to modify their existing batch programs. We show the excellent performance of the MPI-enabled SPIDER when it is used to perform multi-reference alignment and 3-D reconstruction operations on a number of different computing platforms. We point out some performance issues when the MPI-enabled SPIDER is used for a complete 3-D projection matching refinement run, and propose several ways to further improve the parallel performance of SPIDER on distributed-memory machines.",

        "Title": "Visualization of a group II intron in the 23S rRNA of a stable ribosome.",
        "Abstract": "Thousands of introns have been localized to rRNA genes throughout the three domains of life. The consequences of the presence of either a spliced or an unspliced intron in a rRNA for ribosome assembly and packaging are largely unknown. To help address these questions, and to begin an intron imaging study, we selected a member of the self-splicing group II intron family, which is hypothesized to be the progenitor not only of spliceosomal introns but also of non-LTR retrotransposons. We cloned the self-splicing group II Ll.LtrB intron from Lactococcus lactis into L. lactis 23S rRNA. The 2,492-nt Ll.LtrB intron comprises a catalytic core and an ORF, which encodes a protein, LtrA. LtrA forms a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with the intron RNA to mediate splicing and mobility. The chimeric 23S-intron RNA was shown to be splicing proficient in its native host in the presence of LtrA. Furthermore, a low-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction of the L. lactis ribosome fused to the intron-LtrA RNP of a splicing-defective Ll.LtrB intron was obtained. The image revealed the intron as a large, well defined structure. The activity and structural integrity of the intron indicate not only that it can coexist with the ribosome but also that its presence permits the assembly of a stable ribosome. Additionally, we view our results as a proof of principle that ribosome chimeras may be generally useful for studying a wide variety of structured RNAs and RNP complexes that are not amenable to NMR, crystallographic, or single-particle cryo-EM methodologies.",

        "Abstract": "The protein-conducting channel (PCC) must allow both the translocation of soluble polypeptide regions across, and the lateral partitioning of hydrophobic transmembrane helices (TMHs) into, the membrane. We have analyzed existing structures of ribosomes and ribosome-PCC complexes and observe conformational changes suggesting that the ribosome may sense and orient the nascent polypeptide and also facilitate conformational changes in the PCC, subsequently directing the nascent polypeptide into the appropriate PCC-mediated translocation mode. The PCC is predicted to be able to accommodate one central, consolidated channel or two segregated pores with different lipid accessibilities, which may enable the lipid-mediated partitioning of a TMH from one pore, while the other, aqueous, pore allows translocation of a hydrophilic polypeptide segment. Our hypothesis suggests a plausible mechanism for the transitioning of the PCC between different configurations.",

A cascade of RNA rearrangements propagates from the exit tunnel throughout the large subunit, affecting intersubunit bridges and tRNA positions, which in turn reorient small subunit RNA elements. Elongation arrest could result from the inhibition of mRNA.(tRNAs) translocation, E site tRNA egress, and perhaps translation factor activation at the GTPase-associated center. Our study suggests that the specific secondary and tertiary arrangement of ribosomal RNA provides the basis for internal signal transduction within the ribosome. Thus, the ribosome may itself have the ability to regulate its progression through translation by modulating its structure and consequently its receptivity to activation by cofactors.",

Cryo-EM has shed light on the structure of the ribosome during the four steps of translation: initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling. Interpretation of cryo-EM reconstructions of the ribosome in quasi-atomic detail reveals a picture in which the ribosome uses RNA not only to catalyze chemical reactions, but also as a means for signal transduction over large distances.",

        "Abstract": "The interaction between the GTPase-associated center (GAC) and the aminoacyl-tRNA.EF-Tu.GTP ternary complex is of crucial importance in the dynamic process of decoding and tRNA accommodation. The GAC includes protein L11 and helices 43-44 of 23S rRNA (referred to as L11-rRNA complex). In this study, a method of fitting based on a systematic comparison between cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density maps and structures obtained by molecular dynamics simulations has been developed. This method has led to the finding of atomic models of the GAC that fit the EM maps with much improved cross-correlation coefficients compared with the fitting of the X-ray structure. Two types of conformations of the L11-rRNA complex, produced by the simulations, match the cryo-EM maps representing the states either bound or unbound to the aa-tRNA.EF-Tu.GTP ternary complex. In the bound state, the N-terminal domain of L11 is extended from its position in the crystal structure, and the base of nucleotide A1067 in the 23S ribosomal RNA is flipped out. This position of the base allows the RNA to reach the elbow region of the aminoacyl-tRNA when the latter is bound in the A/T site. In the unbound state, the N-terminal domain of L11 is rotated only slightly, and A1067 of the RNA is flipped back into the less-solvent-exposed position, as in the crystal structure. By matching our experimental cryo-EM maps with much improved cross-correlation coefficients compared to the crystal structure, these two conformations prove to be strong candidates of the two functional states.",

        "Abstract": "The bootstrap-based method for calculation of the 3D variance in cryo-EM maps reconstructed from sets of their projections was applied to a dataset of functional ribosomal complexes containing the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome, tRNAs, and elongation factor G (EF-G). The variance map revealed regions of high variability in the intersubunit space of the ribosome: in the locations of tRNAs, in the putative location of EF-G, and in the vicinity of the L1 protein. This result indicated heterogeneity of the dataset. A method of focused classification was put forward in order to sort out the projection data into approximately homogenous subsets. The method is based on the identification and localization of a region of high variance that a subsequent classification step can be focused on by the use of a 3D spherical mask. After initial classification, template volumes are created and are subsequently refined using a multireference 3D projection alignment procedure. In the application to the ribosome dataset, the two resulting structures were interpreted as resulting from ribosomal complexes with bound EF-G and an empty A site, or, alternatively, from complexes that had no EF-G bound but had both A and P sites occupied by tRNA. The proposed method of focused classification proved to be a successful tool in the analysis of the heterogeneous cryo-EM dataset. The associated calculation of the correlations within the density map confirmed the conformational variability of the complex, which could be interpreted in terms of the ribosomal elongation cycle.",

        "Abstract": "Density maps of a molecule obtained by single-particle reconstruction from thousands of molecule projections exhibit strong changes in local definition and reproducibility, as a consequence of conformational variability of the molecule and non-stoichiometry of ligand binding. These changes complicate the interpretation of density maps in terms of molecular structure. A three-dimensional (3-D) variance map provides an effective tool to assess the structural definition in each volume element. In this work, the different contributions to the 3-D variance in a single-particle reconstruction are discussed, and an effective method for the estimation of the 3-D variance map is proposed, using a bootstrap technique of sampling. Computations with test data confirm the viability, computational efficiency, and accuracy of the method under conditions encountered in practical circumstances.",

        "Title": "Interactions of the release factor RF1 with the ribosome as revealed by cryo-EM.",
        "Abstract": "In eubacteria, termination of translation is signaled by any one of the stop codons UAA, UAG, and UGA moving into the ribosomal A site. Two release factors, RF1 and RF2, recognize and bind to the stop codons with different affinities and trigger the hydrolysis of the ester bond that links the polypeptide with the P-site tRNA. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) results obtained in this study show that ribosome-bound RF1 is in an open conformation, unlike the closed conformation observed in the crystal structure of the free factor, allowing its simultaneous access to both the decoding center and the peptidyl-transferase center. These results are similar to those obtained for RF2, but there is an important difference in how the factors bind to protein L11, which forms part of the GTPase-associated center of the large ribosomal subunit. The difference in the binding position, C-terminal domain for RF2 versus N-terminal domain for RF1, explains a body of L11 mutation studies that revealed differential effects on the activity of the two factors. Very recent data obtained with small-angle X-ray scattering now reveal that the solution structure of RF1 is open, as here seen on the ribosome by cryo-EM, and not closed, as seen in the crystal.",

        "Abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography of frozen-hydrated specimens holds considerable promise for high-resolution three-dimensional imaging of organelles and macromolecular complexes in their native cellular environment. While the technique has been successfully used with small, plunge-frozen cells and organelles, application to bulk mammalian tissue has proven to be difficult. We report progress with cryo-electron tomography of frozen-hydrated sections of rat liver prepared by high-pressure freezing and cryo-ultramicrotomy. Improvements include identification of suitable grids for mounting sections for tomography, reduction of surface artifacts on the sections, improved image quality by the use of energy filtering, and more rapid tissue excision using a biopsy needle. Tomographic reconstructions of frozen-hydrated liver sections reveal the native structure of such cellular components as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes, without the selective attenuation or enhancement of ultrastructural details associated with the osmication and post-staining used with freeze-substitution.",

        "Abstract": "During tRNA translocation on the ribosome, an arc-like connection (ALC) is formed between the G' domain of elongation factor G (EF-G) and the L7/L12-stalk base of the large ribosomal subunit in the GDP state. To delineate the boundary of EF-G within the ALC, we tagged an amino acid residue near the tip of the G' domain of EF-G with undecagold, which was then visualized with three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Two distinct positions for the undecagold, observed in the GTP-state and GDP-state cryo-EM maps of the ribosome bound EF-G, allowed us to determine the movement of the labeled amino acid. Molecular analyses of the cryo-EM maps show: (1) that three structural components, the N-terminal domain of ribosomal protein L11, the C-terminal domain of ribosomal protein L7/L12, and the G' domain of EF-G, participate in formation of the ALC; and (2) that both EF-G and the ribosomal protein L7/L12 undergo large conformational changes to form the ALC.",

        "Abstract": "Boxing hundreds of thousands of particles in low-dose electron micrographs is one of the major bottle-necks in advancing toward achieving atomic resolution reconstructions of biological macromolecules. We have shown that a combination of pre-processing operations and segmentation can be used as an effective, automatic tool for identifying and boxing single-particle images. This paper provides a brief description of how this method has been applied to a large data set of micrographs of ice-embedded ribosomes, including a comparative analysis of the efficiency of the method. Some results on processing micrographs of tripeptidyl peptidase II particles are also shown. In both cases, we have achieved our goal of selecting at least 80% of the particles that an expert would select with less than 10% false positives.",

Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the Escherichia coli PCC, SecYEG, complexed with the ribosome and a nascent chain containing a signal anchor. This reconstruction shows a messenger RNA, three transfer RNAs, the nascent chain, and detailed features of both a translocating PCC and a second, non-translocating PCC bound to mRNA hairpins. The translocating PCC forms connections with ribosomal RNA hairpins on two sides and ribosomal proteins at the back, leaving a frontal opening. Normal mode-based flexible fitting of the archaeal SecYEbeta structure into the PCC electron microscopy densities favours a front-to-front arrangement of two SecYEG complexes in the PCC, and supports channel formation by the opening of two linked SecY halves during polypeptide translocation. On the basis of our observation in the translocating PCC of two segregated pores with different degrees of access to bulk lipid, we propose a model for co-translational protein translocation.",

        "Abstract": "We present analysis, by cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction, of the structure of the 80S ribosome from Trypanosoma cruzi, the kinetoplastid protozoan pathogen that causes Chagas disease. The density map of the T. cruzi 80S ribosome shows the phylogenetically conserved eukaryotic rRNA core structure, together with distinctive structural features in both the small and large subunits. Remarkably, a previously undescribed helical structure appears in the small subunit in the vicinity of the mRNA exit channel. We propose that this rRNA structure likely participates in the recruitment of ribosome onto the 5' end of mRNA, in facilitating and modulating the initiation of translation that is unique to the trypanosomes.",

        "Abstract": "Ribosome recycling, the disassembly of the posttermination complex after each round of protein synthesis, is an essential step in mRNA translation, but its mechanism has remained obscure. In eubacteria, recycling is catalyzed by RRF (ribosome recycling factor) and EF-G (elongation factor G). By using cryo-electron microscopy, we have obtained two density maps, one of the RRF bound posttermination complex and one of the 50S subunit bound with both EF-G and RRF. Comparing the two maps, we found domain I of RRF to be in the same orientation, while domain II in the EF-G-containing 50S subunit is extensively rotated (approximately 60 degrees) compared to its orientation in the 70S complex. Mapping the 50S conformation of RRF onto the 70S posttermination complex suggests that it can disrupt the intersubunit bridges B2a and B3, and thus effect a separation of the two subunits. These observations provide the structural basis for the mechanism by which the posttermination complex is split into subunits by the joint action of RRF and EF-G.",

        "Abstract": "The 70S ribosome and its complement of factors required for initiation of translation in E. coli were purified separately and reassembled in vitro with GDPNP, producing a stable initiation complex (IC) stalled after 70S assembly. We have obtained a cryo-EM reconstruction of the IC showing IF2*GDPNP at the intersubunit cleft of the 70S ribosome. IF2*GDPNP contacts the 30S and 50S subunits as well as fMet-tRNA(fMet). IF2 here adopts a conformation radically different from that seen in the recent crystal structure of IF2. The C-terminal domain of IF2 binds to the single-stranded portion of fMet-tRNA(fMet), thereby forcing the tRNA into a novel orientation at the P site. The GTP binding domain of IF2 binds to the GTPase-associated center of the 50S subunit in a manner similar to EF-G and EF-Tu. Additionally, we present evidence for the localization of IF1, IF3, one C-terminal domain of L7/L12, and the N-terminal domain of IF2 in the initiation complex.",

        "Title": "Automated acquisition of cryo-electron micrographs for single particle reconstruction on an FEI Tecnai electron microscope.",
        "Abstract": "AutoEM is a software package developed by Zhang et al. [J. Struct. Biol. 1356, 251] for semi-automated acquisition of cryo-electron micrographs from Tecnai series electron microscopes and is used frequently at the lowest level of automation. We report here on the new progress that we have made based on their preliminary work. A fourth low-dose state is created where the system can pre-select all the good holes in a grid square from a single CCD image taken at low magnification, making the system operative at much higher levels of automation. An additional control interface enables the operator to monitor the status of the program and the quality of the data, interact with the program, and direct the execution process according to intermediate results. When data acquisition is in progress, all useful information is automatically saved in certain text files which are easily accessible by a database. More detailed improvements and general advantages are illustrated and discussed. We have started to use the program to perform routine data collection. A number of applications show that the performance of the program is satisfactory and the quality of the micrographs and their power spectra acquired by the program is comparable to those manually collected under the same conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Real-space refinement has been previously introduced as a flexible fitting method to interpret medium-resolution cryo-EM density maps in terms of atomic structures. In this way, conformational changes related to functional processes can be analyzed on the molecular level. In the application of the technique to the ribosome, quasiatomic models have been derived that have advanced our understanding of translocation. In this article, the choice of parameters for the fitting procedure is discussed. The quality of the fitting depends critically on the number of rigid pieces into which the model is divided. Suitable quality indicators are crosscorrelation, R factor, and density residual, all of which can also be locally applied. The example of the ribosome may provide some guidelines for general applications of real-space refinement to flexible fitting problems.",

        "Title": "Size determination of cyanobacterial and higher plant photosystem II by gel permeation chromatography, light scattering, and ultracentrifugation.",
        "Abstract": "The oxygen-evolving photosystem II core complexes (PSIIcc) from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus (PSIIccTe) and the higher plant Spinacia oleracea (PSIIccSo) have been isolated from the thylakoid membrane by solubilization with n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside, purified and characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). DLS suggests that PSIIcc from both organisms exists as a monomer in dilute solution and aggregates with increasing protein concentration. In contrast to DLS, GPC and AUC showed that PSIIcc of both organisms occur as monomers and dimers, and it became clear from our studies that calibration of GPC columns with soluble proteins leads to wrong estimates of the molecular masses of membrane proteins. At a PSIIcc protein concentration of 0.2 mg/mL, molar masses, M, of 756 +/- 18 kDa and 710 +/- 15 kDa for dimeric PSIIccTe and PSIIccSo, respectively, were determined by analytical ultracentrifugation. At very low protein concentrations, at or below 0.05 mg/mL, the dimeric form of PSIIccTe partially dissociates (20-30%) to form monomers. On the basis of these studies 3-dimensional crystals of PSIIccTe were obtained that contain dimers in the asymmetric unit [Zouni, A. et al. (2001) Nature 409, 739-743]. Using synchrotron radiation the crystals diffract to a resolution of 3.8 A, which has been improved recently to 3.2 A [Biesiadka, J., et al. (2004) Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 6, 4733-4736].",

        "Abstract": "Translation is the process by which the genetic information contained in mRNA is used to link amino acids in a predetermined sequential order into a polypeptide chain, which then folds into a protein. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are the adapter molecules designed to provide the \"lookup\" from codons to amino acids. Cryo-EM has provided evidence that the ribosome, as a molecular machine, undergoes many structural changes during translation. Recent findings show that the tRNA structure itself undergoes large conformational changes as well, and that the decoding process must be seen as a complex dynamic interplay between tRNA and the ribosome.",

        "Abstract": "The receptor for activated C-kinase (RACK1) is a scaffold protein that is able to interact simultaneously with several signalling molecules. It binds to protein kinases and membrane-bound receptors in a regulated fashion. Interestingly, RACK1 is also a constituent of the eukaryotic ribosome, and a recent cryo-electron microscopy study localized it to the head region of the 40S subunit in the vicinity of the messenger RNA (mRNA) exit channel. RACK1 recruits activated protein kinase C to the ribosome, which leads to the stimulation of translation through the phosphorylation of initiation factor 6 and, potentially, of mRNA-associated proteins. RACK1 therefore links signal-transduction pathways directly to the ribosome, which allows translation to be regulated in response to cell stimuli. In addition, the fact that RACK1 associates with membrane-bound receptors indicates that it promotes the docking of ribosomes at sites where local translation is required, such as focal adhesions.",

        "Title": "Crystal structure of calf spleen purine nucleoside phosphorylase with two full trimers in the asymmetric unit: important implications for the mechanism of catalysis.",
        "Abstract": "The crystal structure of the binary complex of trimeric purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) from calf spleen with the acyclic nucleoside phosphonate inhibitor 2,6-diamino-(S)-9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]purine ((S)-PMPDAP) is determined at 2.3A resolution in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1). Crystallization in this space group, which is observed for the first time with a calf spleen PNP crystal structure, is obtained in the presence of calcium atoms. In contrast to the previously described cubic space group P2(1)3, two independent trimers are observed in the asymmetric unit, hence possible differences between monomers forming the biologically active trimer could be detected, if present. Such differences would be expected due to third-of-the-sites binding documented for transition-state events and inhibitors. However, no differences are noted, and binding stoichiometry of three inhibitor molecules per enzyme trimer is observed in the crystal structure, and in the parallel solution studies using isothermal titration calorimetry and spectrofluorimetric titrations. Presence of phosphate was shown to modify binding stoichiometry of hypoxanthine. Therefore, the enzyme was also crystallized in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) in the presence of (S)-PMPDAP and phosphate, and the resulting structure of the binary PNP/(S)-PMPDAP complex was refined at 2.05A resolution. No qualitative differences between complexes obtained with and without the presence of phosphate were detected, except for the hydrogen bond contact of Arg84 and a phosphonate group, which is observed only in the former complex in three out of six independent monomers. Possible hydrogen bonds observed in the enzyme complexed with (S)-PMPDAP, in particular a putative hydrogen bonding contact N(1)-H cdots, three dots, centered Glu201, indicate that the inhibitor binds in a tautomeric or ionic form in which position N(1) acts as a hydrogen bond donor. This points to a crucial role of this hydrogen bond in defining specificity of trimeric PNPs and is in line with the proposed mechanism of catalysis in which this contact helps to stabilize the negative charge that accumulates on O(6) of the purine base in the transition state. In the present crystal structure the loop between Thr60 and Ala65 was found in a different conformation than that observed in crystal structures of trimeric PNPs up to now. Due to this change a new wide entrance is opened into the active site pocket, which is otherwise buried in the interior of the protein. Hence, our present crystal structure provides no obvious indication for obligatory binding of one of the substrates before binding of a second one; it is rather consistent with random binding of substrates. All these results provide new data for clarifying the mechanism of catalysis and give reasons for the non-Michaelis kinetics of trimeric PNPs.",

        "Abstract": "RACK1 serves as a scaffold protein for a wide range of kinases and membrane-bound receptors. It is a WD-repeat family protein and is predicted to have a beta-propeller architecture with seven blades like a Gbeta protein. Mass spectrometry studies have identified its association with the small subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes and, most recently, it has been shown to regulate initiation by recruiting protein kinase C to the 40S subunit. Here we present the results of a cryo-EM study of the 80S ribosome that positively locate RACK1 on the head region of the 40S subunit, in the immediate vicinity of the mRNA exit channel. One face of RACK1 exposes the WD-repeats as a platform for interactions with kinases and receptors. Using this platform, RACK1 can recruit other proteins to the ribosome.",

        "Abstract": "Internal initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotes is accomplished by recruitment of ribosomes to structured internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), which are located in certain viral and cellular messenger RNAs. An IRES element in cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) can directly assemble 80S ribosomes in the absence of canonical initiation factors and initiator tRNA. Here we present cryo-EM structures of the CrPV IRES bound to the human ribosomal 40S subunit and to the 80S ribosome. The CrPV IRES adopts a defined, elongate structure within the ribosomal intersubunit space and forms specific contacts with components of the ribosomal A, P, and E sites. Conformational changes in the ribosome as well as within the IRES itself show that CrPV IRES actively manipulates the ribosome. CrPV-like IRES elements seem to act as RNA-based translation factors.",

        "Title": "Visualization of ribosome-recycling factor on the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome: functional implications.",
        "Abstract": "After the termination step of protein synthesis, a deacylated tRNA and mRNA remain associated with the ribosome. The ribosome-recycling factor (RRF), together with elongation factor G (EF-G), disassembles this posttermination complex into mRNA, tRNA, and the ribosome. We have obtained a three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopic map of a complex of the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome and RRF. We find that RRF interacts mainly with the segments of the large ribosomal subunit's (50S) rRNA helices that are involved in the formation of two central intersubunit bridges, B2a and B3. The binding of RRF induces considerable conformational changes in some of the functional domains of the ribosome. As compared to its binding position derived previously by hydroxyl radical probing study, we find that RRF binds further inside the intersubunit space of the ribosome such that the tip of its domain I is shifted (by approximately 13 A) toward protein L5 within the central protuberance of the 50S subunit, and domain II is oriented more toward the small ribosomal subunit (30S). Overlapping binding sites of RRF, EF-G, and the P-site tRNA suggest that the binding of EF-G would trigger the removal of deacylated tRNA from the P site by moving RRF toward the ribosomal E site, and subsequent removal of mRNA may be induced by a shift in the position of 16S rRNA helix 44, which harbors part of the mRNA.",

        "Title": "Folding kinetics and structure of OEP16.",
        "Abstract": "The chloroplast outer membrane contains different, specialized pores that are involved in highly specific traffic processes from the cytosol into the chloroplast and vice versa. One representative member of these channels is the outer envelope protein 16 (OEP16), a cation-selective high conductance channel with high selectivity for amino acids. Here we study the mechanism and kinetics of the folding of this membrane protein by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy, using deletion mutants of the two single tryptophanes Trp-77-->Phe-77 and Trp-100-->Phe-100. In addition, the wild-type spectra were deconvoluted, depicting the individual contributions from each of the two tryptophan residues. The results show that both tryptophan residues are located in a completely different environment. The Trp-77 is deeply buried in the hydrophobic part of the protein, whereas the Trp-100 is partially solvent exposed. These results were further confirmed by studies of fluorescence quenching with I(-). The kinetics of the protein folding are studied by stopped flow fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements. The folding process depends highly on the detergent concentration and can be divided into an ultrafast phase (k > 1000 s(-1)), a fast phase (200-800 s(-1)), and a slow phase (25-70 s(-1)). The slow phase is absent in the W100F mutant. Secondary structure analysis and comparision with closely related proteins led to a new model of the structure of OEP16, suggesting that the protein is, in contrast to most other outer membrane proteins studied so far, purely alpha-helical, consisting of four transmembrane helices. Trp-77 is located in helix II, whereas the Trp-100 is located in the loop between helices II and III, close to the interface to helix III. We suggest that the first, very fast process corresponds to the formation of the helices, whereas the insertion of the helices into the detergent micelle and the correct folding of the II-III loop may be the later, rate-limiting steps of the folding process.",

        "Abstract": "Cotranslational translocation of proteins across or into membranes is a vital process in all kingdoms of life. It requires that the translating ribosome be targeted to the membrane by the signal recognition particle (SRP), an evolutionarily conserved ribonucleoprotein particle. SRP recognizes signal sequences of nascent protein chains emerging from the ribosome. Subsequent binding of SRP leads to a pause in peptide elongation and to the ribosome docking to the membrane-bound SRP receptor. Here we present the structure of a targeting complex consisting of mammalian SRP bound to an active 80S ribosome carrying a signal sequence. This structure, solved to 12 A by cryo-electron microscopy, enables us to generate a molecular model of SRP in its functional conformation. The model shows how the S domain of SRP contacts the large ribosomal subunit at the nascent chain exit site to bind the signal sequence, and that the Alu domain reaches into the elongation-factor-binding site of the ribosome, explaining its elongation arrest activity.",

        "Abstract": "An 11.7-A-resolution cryo-EM map of the yeast 80S.eEF2 complex in the presence of the antibiotic sordarin was interpreted in molecular terms, revealing large conformational changes within eEF2 and the 80S ribosome, including a rearrangement of the functionally important ribosomal intersubunit bridges. Sordarin positions domain III of eEF2 so that it can interact with the sarcin-ricin loop of 25S rRNA and protein rpS23 (S12p). This particular conformation explains the inhibitory action of sordarin and suggests that eEF2 is stalled on the 80S ribosome in a conformation that has similarities with the GTPase activation state. A ratchet-like subunit rearrangement (RSR) occurs in the 80S.eEF2.sordarin complex that, in contrast to Escherichia coli 70S ribosomes, is also present in vacant 80S ribosomes. A model is suggested, according to which the RSR is part of a mechanism for moving the tRNAs during the translocation reaction.",

        "Abstract": "Large T antigen is the replicative helicase of simian virus 40. Its specific binding to the origin of replication and oligomerization into a double hexamer distorts and unwinds dsDNA. In viral replication, T antigen acts as a functional homolog of the eukaryotic minichromosome maintenance factor MCM. T antigen is also an oncoprotein involved in transformation through interaction with p53 and pRb. We obtained the three-dimensional structure of the full-length T antigen double hexamer assembled at its origin of replication by cryoelectron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction techniques. The double hexamer shows different degrees of bending along the DNA axis. The two hexamers are differentiated entities rotated relative to each other. Isolated strands of density, putatively assigned to ssDNA, protrude from the hexamer-hexamer junction mainly at two opposite sites. The structure of the T antigen at the origin of replication can be understood as a snapshot of the dynamic events leading to DNA unwinding. Based on these results a model for the initiation of simian virus 40 DNA replication is proposed.",

        "Abstract": "Aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) are delivered to the ribosome as part of the ternary complex of aa-tRNA, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP. Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) study, at a resolution of approximately 9 A, showing that during the incorporation of the aa-tRNA into the 70S ribosome of Escherichia coli, the flexibility of aa-tRNA allows the initial codon recognition and its accommodation into the ribosomal A site. In addition, a conformational change observed in the GTPase-associated center (GAC) of the ribosomal 50S subunit may provide the mechanism by which the ribosome promotes a relative movement of the aa-tRNA with respect to EF-Tu. This relative rearrangement seems to facilitate codon recognition by the incoming aa-tRNA, and to provide the codon-anticodon recognition-dependent signal for the GTPase activity of EF-Tu. From these new findings we propose a mechanism that can explain the sequence of events during the decoding of mRNA on the ribosome.",

        "Abstract": "Local protein synthesis is required for long-lasting synapse-specific plasticity in cultured Aplysia sensorimotor synapses. To identify synaptically localized mRNAs, we prepared a cDNA library from isolated sensory neurites. By sequence analysis, we estimate that the library contains 263 distinct mRNAs, with 98 of these mRNAs constituting 70% of all clones. The localized transcripts are enriched for mRNAs encoding cytoskeletal elements and components of the translational machinery. In situ hybridization confirms that the mRNAs for at least eight of these transcripts are present in distal neurites. Immunocytochemistry reveals that serotonin regulates the translation of one of the localized mRNAs, that encoding alpha1-tubulin. Our identification of mRNAs encoding cytoskeletal elements suggests that local protein synthesis is required for the growth of new synaptic connections associated with persistent synaptic strengthening. Our finding of mRNAs encoding components of the translational machinery suggests that local protein synthesis serves to increase the translational capacity of synapses.",

        "Abstract": "Combining structural data for the ribosome from x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy with dynamic models based on elastic network normal mode analysis, an atomically detailed picture of functionally important structural rearrangements that occur during translocation is elucidated. The dynamic model provides a near-atomic description of the ratchet-like rearrangement of the 70S ribosome seen in cryo-electron microscopy, and permits the identification of bridging interactions that either facilitate the conformational switching or maintain structural integrity of the 50S/30S interface. Motions of the tRNAs residing in the A and P sites also suggest the early stages of tRNA translocation as a result of this ratchet-like movement. Displacement of the L1 stalk, alternately closing and opening the intersubunit space near the E site, is observed in the dynamic model, in line with growing experimental evidence for the role of this structural component in facilitating the exiting of tRNA. Finally, a hinge-like transition in the 30S ribosomal subunit, similar to that observed in crystal structures of this complex, is also manifest as a dynamic mode of the ribosome. The coincidence of these dynamic transitions with the individual normal modes of the ribosome and the good correspondence between these motions and those observed in experiment suggest an underlying principle of nature to exploit the shape of molecular assemblies such as the ribosome to provide robustness to functionally important motions.",

        "Abstract": "During the ribosomal translocation, the binding of elongation factor G (EF-G) to the pretranslocational ribosome leads to a ratchet-like rotation of the 30S subunit relative to the 50S subunit in the direction of the mRNA movement. By means of cryo-electron microscopy we observe that this rotation is accompanied by a 20 A movement of the L1 stalk of the 50S subunit, implying that this region is involved in the translocation of deacylated tRNAs from the P to the E site. These ribosomal motions can occur only when the P-site tRNA is deacylated. Prior to peptidyl-transfer to the A-site tRNA or peptide removal, the presence of the charged P-site tRNA locks the ribosome and prohibits both of these motions.",

Comparison of the two resulting atomic models shows that the ribosome changes from a compact structure to a looser one, coupled with the rearrangement of many of the proteins. Furthermore, in contrast to the unchanged inter-subunit bridges formed wholly by RNA, the bridges involving proteins undergo large conformational changes following the ratchet-like motion, suggesting an important role of ribosomal proteins in facilitating the dynamics of translation.",

        "Abstract": "Reference bias refers to a common problem in fitting experimental data to an initial model. Given enough free parameters, a good fit of any experimental data to the model can be obtained, even if the experimental data contain only noise. Reference-based alignment methods used in electron microscopy (EM) are subject to this type of bias, in that images containing pure noise can regenerate the reference. Cross-validation is based on the idea that the experimental data used to assess the validity of the fitting should not be the same data as were used to do the fitting. Here we present the application of cross-validation to one form of reference-based alignment: 3D-projection matching in single-particle reconstructions. Our results show that reference bias is indeed present in reconstructions, but that the effect is small for real data compared to that for random noise, and that this difference in behavior is magnified, rather than diminished, during iterative refinement.",

        "Abstract": "Bacterial ribosomes stalled on defective messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are rescued by tmRNA, an approximately 300-nucleotide-long molecule that functions as both transfer RNA (tRNA) and mRNA. Translation then switches from the defective message to a short open reading frame on tmRNA that tags the defective nascent peptide chain for degradation. However, the mechanism by which tmRNA can enter and move through the ribosome is unknown. We present a cryo-electron microscopy study at approximately 13 to 15 angstroms of the entry of tmRNA into the ribosome. The structure reveals how tmRNA could move through the ribosome despite its complicated topology and also suggests roles for proteins S1 and SmpB in the function of tmRNA.",

        "Abstract": "Protein synthesis takes place on the ribosome, where genetic information carried by messenger RNA is translated into a sequence of amino acids. This process is terminated when a stop codon moves into the ribosomal decoding centre (DC) and is recognized by a class-1 release factor (RF). RFs have a conserved GGQ amino-acid motif, which is crucial for peptide release and is believed to interact directly with the peptidyl-transferase centre (PTC) of the 50S ribosomal subunit. Another conserved motif of RFs (SPF in RF2) has been proposed to interact directly with stop codons in the DC of the 30S subunit. The distance between the DC and PTC is approximately 73 A. However, in the X-ray structure of RF2, SPF and GGQ are only 23 A apart, indicating that they cannot be at DC and PTC simultaneously. Here we show that RF2 is in an open conformation when bound to the ribosome, allowing GGQ to reach the PTC while still allowing SPF-stop-codon interaction. The results indicate new interpretations of accuracy in termination, and have implications for how the presence of a stop codon in the DC is signalled to PTC.",

        "Abstract": "High quality of the cryo-electron micrographs is of crucial importance for the success of single particle three-dimensional reconstruction methods. In analyzing some micrographs from cryo-electron microscopy specimens, we found an extraordinary variability, within the same micrograph, in the appearance of particles. We developed a method for analyzing the variability of local image quality, using correspondence analysis of local power spectra. With this technique, we discovered a strong systematic variation of the envelope modulating an otherwise unchanged contrast transfer function. The underlying causes may be uncontrollable effects, such as variations in the thickness of ice, instability of the holey carbon, and charging. The method of assaying, resulting in \"local quality maps\", may be useful as a general tool for screening micrographs used as input for reconstructions.",

        "Abstract": "Over the past 5 years, thanks to advances in both instrumentation and computational speed, three-dimensional imaging techniques using the electron microscope have been greatly improved in two areas: electron tomography of cell organelles or cell sections and reconstruction of macromolecules from single particles. Ice embedment has brought a breakthrough in the degree of preservation of specimens under close-to-native conditions. The current challenge is to push the resolution of electron tomographic imaging to a point where macromolecular signatures can be recognized within the cellular context. We show first progress toward this goal by examples in two areas of application: the structure of the muscle triad junction and the architecture and fine structure of mitochondria. As techniques of cryo-microtomy are perfected, we hope to be able to apply tomography to high-pressure frozen sections of tissue.",

        "Abstract": "Electron tomography of frozen-hydrated tissue sections enables analysis of the 3-D structure of cell organelles in situ and in a near-native state. In this study, 160-200-nm-thick sections were cut from high-pressure frozen rat liver, and improved methods were used for handling and mounting the sections. Automated data collection facilitated tilt-series recording at low electron dose (approximately 4000 e(-)/nm(2) at 400 keV). Higher doses (up to 10,000 e(-)/nm(2)) were found to increase contrast and smooth out surface defects, but caused section distortion and movement, with likely loss of high-resolution information. Tomographic reconstruction showed that knife marks were 10-40 nm deep and located on the \"knife face\" of the section, while crevices were 20-50 nm deep and found on the \"block face.\" The interior of the section was normally free of defects, except for compression, and contained useful structural information. For example, the topology of mitochondrial membranes in tissue was found to be very similar to that in frozen-hydrated whole mounts of isolated mitochondria. In rare cases, a 15-nm banding pattern perpendicular to the cutting direction was observed in the interior of the section, most evident in the uniformly dense, protein-rich material of the mitochondrial matrix.",

        "Abstract": "During the elongation cycle of protein biosynthesis, the specific amino acid coded for by the mRNA is delivered by a complex that is comprised of the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA, elongation factor Tu and GTP. As this ternary complex binds to the ribosome, the anticodon end of the tRNA reaches the decoding center in the 30S subunit. Here we present the cryo- electron microscopy (EM) study of an Escherichia coli 70S ribosome-bound ternary complex stalled with an antibiotic, kirromycin. In the cryo-EM map the anticodon arm of the tRNA presents a new conformation that appears to facilitate the initial codon-anticodon interaction. Furthermore, the elbow region of the tRNA is seen to contact the GTPase-associated center on the 50S subunit of the ribosome, suggesting an active role of the tRNA in the transmission of the signal prompting the GTP hydrolysis upon codon recognition.",
