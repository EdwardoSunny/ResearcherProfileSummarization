        "Abstract": "Activation of cell-autonomous defense by the immune cytokine interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) is critical to the control of life-threatening infections in humans. IFN-\u03b3 induces the expression of hundreds of host proteins in all nucleated cells and tissues, yet many of these proteins remain uncharacterized. We screened 19,050 human genes by CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis and identified IFN-\u03b3-induced apolipoprotein L3 (APOL3) as a potent bactericidal agent protecting multiple non-immune barrier cell types against infection. Canonical apolipoproteins typically solubilize mammalian lipids for extracellular transport; APOL3 instead targeted cytosol-invasive bacteria to dissolve their anionic membranes into human-bacterial lipoprotein nanodiscs detected by native mass spectrometry and visualized by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Thus, humans have harnessed the detergent-like properties of extracellular apolipoproteins to fashion an intracellular lysin, thereby endowing resident nonimmune cells with a mechanism to achieve sterilizing immunity.",

        "Abstract": "Multiple cytosolic innate sensors form large signalosomes after activation, but this assembly needs to be tightly regulated to avoid accumulation of misfolded aggregates. We found that the eIF2\u03b1 kinase heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) controls NOD1 signalosome folding and activation through a process requiring eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), the transcription factor ATF4, and the heat shock protein HSPB8. The HRI/eIF2\u03b1 signaling axis was also essential for signaling downstream of the innate immune mediators NOD2, MAVS, and TRIF but dispensable for pathways dependent on MyD88 or STING. Moreover, filament-forming \u03b1-synuclein activated HRI-dependent responses, which suggests that the HRI pathway may restrict toxic oligomer formation. We propose that HRI, eIF2\u03b1, and HSPB8 define a novel cytosolic unfolded protein response (cUPR) essential for optimal innate immune signaling by large molecular platforms, functionally homologous to the PERK/eIF2\u03b1/HSPA5 axis of the endoplasmic reticulum UPR.",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) act as sentinels for incoming pathogens. Cytosol-invasive bacteria, such as Shigella flexneri, trigger a robust pro-inflammatory nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) response from IECs that is believed to depend entirely on the peptidoglycan sensor NOD1. We found that, during Shigella infection, the TRAF-interacting forkhead-associated protein A (TIFA)-dependent cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses the bacterial metabolite heptose-1,7-bisphosphate (HBP), functions after NOD1 to detect bacteria replicating free in the host cytosol. Whereas NOD1 mediated a transient burst of NF-\u03baB activation during bacterial entry, TIFA sensed HBP released during bacterial replication, assembling into large signaling complexes to drive a dynamic inflammatory response that reflected the rate of intracellular\u00a0bacterial proliferation. Strikingly, IECs lacking\u00a0TIFA were unable to discriminate between proliferating and stagnant intracellular bacteria, despite the NOD1/2 pathways being intact. Our results define TIFA as a rheostat for intracellular bacterial replication, escalating the immune response to invasive Gram-negative bacteria that exploit the host cytosol for growth.",

        "Abstract": "Host recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) initiates an innate immune response that is critical for pathogen elimination and engagement of adaptive immunity. Here we show that mammalian cells can detect and respond to the bacterial-derived monosaccharide heptose-1,7-bisphosphate (HBP). A metabolic intermediate in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, HBP is highly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria, yet absent from eukaryotic cells. Detection of HBP within the host cytosol activated the nuclear facto \u03baB pathway in vitro and induced innate and adaptive immune responses in vivo. Moreover, we used a genome-wide RNA interference screen to uncover an innate immune signaling axis, mediated by phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization of the TRAF-interacting protein with forkhead-associated domain (TIFA) that is triggered by HBP. Thus, HBP is a PAMP that activates TIFA-dependent immunity to Gram-negative bacteria.",

        "Title": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae-derived heptose elicits an innate immune response and drives HIV-1 expression.",
        "Abstract": "Clinical and epidemiological synergy exists between the globally important sexually transmitted infections, gonorrhea and HIV. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhea, is particularly adept at driving HIV-1 expression, but the molecular determinants of this relationship remain undefined. N. gonorrhoeae liberates a soluble factor that potently induces expression from the HIV-1 LTR in coinfected cluster of differentiation 4-positive (CD4(+)) T lymphocytes, but this factor is not a previously described innate effector. A genome-wide mutagenesis approach was undertaken to reveal which component(s) of N. gonorrhoeae induce HIV-1 expression in CD4(+) T lymphocytes. A mutation in the ADP-heptose biosynthesis gene, hldA, rendered the bacteria unable to induce HIV-1 expression. The hldA mutant has a truncated lipooligosaccharide structure, contains lipid A in its outer membrane, and remains bioactive in a TLR4 reporter-based assay but did not induce HIV-1 expression. Mass spectrometry analysis of extensively fractionated N. gonorrhoeae-derived supernatants revealed that the LTR-inducing fraction contained a compound having a mass consistent with heptose-monophosphate (HMP). Heptose is a carbohydrate common in microbes but is absent from the mammalian glycome. Although ADP-heptose biosynthesis is common among Gram-negative bacteria, and heptose is a core component of most lipopolysaccharides, N. gonorrhoeae is peculiar in that it effectively liberates HMP during growth. This N. gonorrhoeae-derived HMP activates CD4(+) T cells to invoke an NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional response that drives HIV-1 expression and viral production. Our study thereby shows that heptose is a microbial-specific product that is sensed as an innate immune agonist and unveils the molecular link between N. gonorrhoeae and HIV-1.",

        "Title": "Antibodies in infectious diseases: polyclonals, monoclonals and niche biotechnology.",
        "Abstract": "Antibody preparations have a long history of providing protection from infectious diseases. Although antibodies remain the only natural host-derived defense mechanism capable of completely preventing infection, as products, they compete against inexpensive therapeutics such as antibiotics, small molecule inhibitors and active vaccines. The continued discovery in the monoclonal antibody (mAb) field of leads with broadened cross neutralization of viruses and demonstrable synergy of antibody with antibiotics for bacterial diseases, clearly show that innovation remains. The commercial success of mAbs in chronic disease has not been paralleled in infectious diseases for several reasons. Infectious disease immunotherapeutics are limited in scope as endemic diseases necessitate active vaccine development. Also, the complexity of these small markets draws the interest of niche companies rather than big pharmaceutical corporations. Lastly, the cost of goods for mAb therapeutics is inherently high for infectious agents due to the need for antibody cocktails, which better mimic polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations and prevent antigenic escape. In cases where vaccine or convalescent populations are available, current polyclonal hyperimmune immunoglobulin preparations (pIgG), with modern and highly efficient purification technology and standardized assays for potency, can make economic sense. Recent innovations to broaden the potency of mAb therapies, while reducing cost of production, are discussed herein. On the basis of centuries of effective use of Ab treatments, and with growing immunocompromised populations, the question is not whether antibodies have a bright future for infectious agents, but rather what formats are cost effective and generate safe and efficacious treatments to satisfy regulatory approval.",

        "Abstract": "The cervical mucosa of women who are highly exposed to HIV-1, yet remain persistently seronegative (HEPS), presents a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of an immune compartment potentially capable of preventing HIV-1 infection. Herein, we provide a detailed characterization of the immunoglobulin repertoire of cervical and systemic B cells from one such HEPS individual from Nairobi, Kenya. Analysis was done on 512 VH sequences that were RT-PCR amplified from B cells in a paired sample from the cervix and peripheral blood. The VH3 and DH repertoire of class switched cervical B cells differs significantly from that of systemic B cells indicating that the cervical environment affects local B cell populations and hence VH gene expression. Six networks of clonally related, heavily mutated B cells were identified that spanned the systemic and cervical B cell compartments. Analysis of somatic mutations suggests this is likely the result of systemic, class switched B cells homing to the cervical mucosa. Multiple networks of somatically mutated V-gene sequences, unique to the cervical mucosa, were also identified. This supports the notion that site specific responses occur and have unique regulation of tolerance and recruitment into local memory or blast B cell compartments. We conclude that while the nature of the cervical environment shapes the local B cell repertoire, the infusion of post germinal center B cells to the human cervix is a common occurrence, and represents a means by which systemic immunization could provide the local antibodies necessary to prevent HIV-1 at the site of initial contact.",
