        "Abstract": "The relationship of embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, the stem cells of germ cell- or embryo-derived teratocarcinoma tumors, to early embryonic cells came under intense scrutiny in the early 1970s when mouse chimeras were produced between EC cells and embryos. These chimeras raised tantalizing possibilities and high hopes for different areas of research. The normalization of EC cells by the embryo lent validity to their use as in vitro models for embryogenesis and indicated that they might reveal information about the relationship between malignancy and differentiation. Chimeras also showed the way for the potential introduction of genes, selected in EC cells in vitro, into the germ line of mice. Although EC cells provided material for the elucidation of early embryonic events and stimulated many studies of early molecular differentiation, after years of intense scrutiny,\u00a0they fell short as the means of genetic manipulation of the germ line, although arguably they pointed the way to the development of embryonic stem (ES) cells that eventually fulfilled this goal.",

        "Abstract": "Well-planned strategies are an essential prerequisite for any mutational analysis involving gene targeting. Consideration of the advantages or disadvantages of different methods will aid in the production of a final product that is both technically feasible and versatile. Strategies for gene-targeting experiments in the mouse are discussed, including the rationale behind some of the common elements of gene-targeting vectors, such as homologous DNA and the use of different site-specific recombinases. We detail positive and negative selection as well as screening strategies for homologous recombination events in embryonic stem (ES) cells. For the planning stages of making different types of alleles, we first consider general strategies and then provide details specific to either homologous recombination in ES cells or making alleles by gene editing with CRISPR-Cas in preimplantation embryos. The types of alleles considered are null or knockout alleles, reporter gene knock-in alleles, point mutations, and conditional null alleles.",

If a homozygous mutant phenotype causes the death of embryos during this period, simple culture methods are available that support preimplantation development to allow a thorough morphological assessment. Embryos are recovered from the oviducts or uterus and examined for gross morphology, cell number, and progression through cleavage stages. Blastocysts can also be cultured over the implantation period and undergo a process analogous to implantation in vitro. Different categories of phenotypes such as failure of compaction, abnormal blastocyst formation, or failure to hatch from the zona pellucida and failure to attach and outgrow in vitro are discussed in relation to what each phenotype might portend. Further experimental procedures such as isolation and assessment of blastocyst inner cell mass and analysis of induced implantation delay in vivo may also be appropriate. Additional assessment of preimplantation embryos can involve histology and localization of mRNA or proteins either in sections or whole embryos.",

Technical errors that might have occurred during gene targeting or genotyping must first be eliminated. Variable penetrance of the mutation should be considered as well as the possibility of age-related or late-onset phenotypes, such as tumor formation or other pathologies. The gene expression pattern and nature of the protein product of the gene could provide clues. A number of simple tests can be applied to uncover cryptic phenotypes that are not easily seen on casual inspection (e.g., tests of the senses and of balance and coordination). Genetic and environmental challenges can be applied to overtly normal mutant mice to reveal deviations from normal.",

This overview leads you through a sequence of steps to determine whether the homozygous mutants are present at birth or whether the mutation causes prenatal lethality. In the case of a prenatal lethality, the time of death of the mutants, which could occur at any time during pre- or postimplanation development, must be firmly established before further phenotypic analysis. Here, we present a detailed plan to efficiently determine the time of prenatal death of the mutants and provide a guide for developmental landmarks to establish how far they progress during gestation. To determine whether or not homozygous mutants are present or normal at any given time point, it is important to recover a sufficient number of embryos. Examples of a simple Chi square test for Mendelian segregation is provided to establish statistical significance for the genotype/phenotype distribution.",

The breeding schemes for ES chimeras and CRISPR-Cas founders differ. For ES cell chimeras, we discuss the relative benefits of breeding from male or female chimeras. We discuss the importance of genetic background and provide practical advice for putting the mutation on inbred or outbred backgrounds or producing a coisogenic strain. For CRISPR-Cas founders, which will most likely be mosaic for different mutations, initial breeding strategies are discussed to maintain a desired genetic background at the same time as producing progeny to segregate different alleles. Strategies for testing the progeny to recognize indels, missense mutations, and knock-in mutations are discussed. In the event that ES cell chimeras or CRISPR-Cas founders produce no offspring or fail to transmit the mutant allele(s), there is a troubleshooting guide to pinpoint the problem. If heterozygous offspring from the chimeras or founders are normal, fertile, and of both sexes, the analysis of homozygous effects of the mutation can now begin; if not, possible dominant effects are considered.",

        "Abstract": "Dominant effects of a mutation may show up at any time during a mutational analysis, including during the early stages of an embryonic stem (ES) cell gene targeting experiment. Here, we discuss the mechanisms of dominant and semidominant effects and how they might appear if they show up in heterozygous ES cells, in ES cell chimeras, or in heterozygous progeny of chimeras. Similarly, dominant effects may be seen in mice heterozygous for CRISPR-Cas-targeted, -induced, or spontaneous mutations. If the dominant effects prevent the germline transmission of ES cells or cause fertility problems in heterozygotes, they can severely limit further analysis of the mutation. Ways to circumvent such reproductive problems are presented. The special case of imprinted genes, which may be functionally hemizygous and present a different phenotype when inherited from the mother than when inherited from the father, is discussed.",

Whole-embryo in vitro culture prior to the time of death will allow real-time observation of living embryos and direct comparisons with controls. Organ anlage can be removed from embryos and cultured in vitro beyond the time of death of the whole embryo. In both whole embryos and organ anlage culture, fluorescent protein reporters may be used productively to follow cell types or specific gene expression changes. Some cells, such as hematopoietic cells, and organ anlage, may be suitable for transplantation to wild-type hosts for further analysis of their potential. Additionally, cell lines, including embryonic stem (ES) cells, trophoblast stem (TS) cells, extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) stem cells, and epiblast-derived stem cells (EpiSC), can be derived from mutant embryos to reveal the potential of the mutant cells outside the context of the whole organism. Mutant stem cells or even whole mutant embryos can be used to test potential in chimeras or in teratomas.",

There are two distinct but related advantages: first, early lethal effects of the mutation can be bypassed by leaving the gene intact until later stages in development; second, indirect or secondary effects on an organ of interest can be eliminated by tissue- or organ-specific gene deletion. In this overview, we cover aspects of testing and using conditional alleles to ensure that the desired effect is obtained, including how to test the engineered conditional allele to ensure it functions as planned, and how to test any recombinase mouse strain used, including inducible transgenic or knock-in lines. Finally, we discuss how to use a conditional allele for maximum value in a phenotypic analysis.",

        "Abstract": "The same gene can have many different functions in different places in the body and/or at different times in development and adult life. Often only one organ or one developmental stage is of particular interest to an investigator. If, however, lethality or severe detrimental effects of a mutation prevent the study of the organ or stage of interest, there are a number of ways to circumvent an early effect. In this overview, we discuss one way of getting around an early lethal phenotype by using chimeras, a method that is also useful for studying the mutant cells in the context of a wild-type host as part of the phenotypic analysis. The composition of chimeras with respect to embryonic cell lineages can be controlled to some extent to produce lineage-restricted chimeras with, for example, mutant cells restricted to certain lineages. Depending on the site of action of the mutant gene, this could result in chimeric \"rescue.\" Details of how to distinguish mutant cells from wild type, an essential part of any chimera experiment, are discussed as well as methods to genotype the chimeras with respect to both component cell types.",

Many morphological abnormalities, lethal or not, can be investigated with gross and histological analyses or by visualization of the developing skeleton. Molecular characterization of mutant phenotypes, guided by the expression pattern of the mutant gene, can reveal disruptions in gene expression patterns of known developmental genes. Cell proliferation and cell death assays will reveal disruptions in cellular dynamics. Various modalities of 3D imaging of intact embryos can provide volumetric information about mutant phenotypes.",

Different mutant alleles of the gene in question might be available from other sources or mutations with similar phenotypes could potentially be alleles. This could be determined by complementation testing. In the production of a conditional allele, retention of exogenous DNA in the allele could fortuitously disrupt a regulatory element and thus result in a hypomorphic allele, which can be simply tested by breeding. Mutations in different genes frequently affect the same organ, tissue, or cell type through genetic interactions. Common approaches to investigate and interpret genetic interactions are detailed here for gene families, in which there may be redundancy or genetic compensation of different genes, for genes that constitute different components of a biochemical pathway, for genes with overlapping expression patterns, and for unrelated genes that produce similar mutant phenotypes.",

        "Abstract": "The starting point in a mutational analysis of gene function is obtaining or producing a mutant. Here different methods of obtaining mouse mutants are discussed, including screening for spontaneous mutants, screening for mutants following chemical or X-ray mutagenesis, and producing mutations through targeted manipulation of the genome. Manipulation of the genome can be random, as in different types of insertional mutagenesis. Alternatively, targeted manipulation such as gene targeting using homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells or gene editing by CRISPR-Cas can be used to produce custom mutations in a specific gene. The basic methods are outlined, and the advantages and disadvantages of homologous recombination and CRISPR-Cas gene editing are discussed. Resources for obtaining mutations that already exist are provided. If, for your planned study, no suitable mutations are available, there is advice about what you should know about your gene of interest before embarking on a gene targeting experiment.",

To determine the time of death, this overview details the characteristic features of lethality shortly after implantation (E4.5-E5.5) or lethality between gastrulation and allantoic fusion (E6.5-E9.5). Determining the phenotype of the mutants involves making a gross morphological assessment, staging the embryos, and photodocumenting any abnormalities. Further levels of analysis discussed are histological assessment, molecular characterization of gene expression in the mutant embryos, and measurements of cell proliferation and cell death.",

An alternative to morphological assessment of cell number is to use fluorescent DNA dyes. This protocol details simple nuclear counting with a single DNA dye (Hoechst) or a more complicated procedure in which differential nuclear counts of the trophectoderm and inner cell mass (ICM) can be made using immunosurgery of the blastocyst and two DNA dyes (Hoechst and propidium iodide).",

        "Abstract": "Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are a major cause of pediatric kidney failure. We performed a genome-wide analysis of copy number variants (CNVs) in 2,824 cases and 21,498 controls. Affected individuals carried a significant burden of rare exonic (that is, affecting coding regions) CNVs and were enriched for known genomic disorders (GD). Kidney anomaly (KA) cases were most enriched for exonic CNVs, encompassing GD-CNVs and novel deletions; obstructive uropathy (OU) had a lower CNV burden and an intermediate prevalence of GD-CNVs; and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) had the fewest GD-CNVs but was enriched for novel exonic CNVs, particularly duplications. Six loci (1q21, 4p16.1-p16.3, 16p11.2, 16p13.11, 17q12 and 22q11.2) accounted for 65% of patients with GD-CNVs. Deletions at 17q12, 4p16.1-p16.3 and 22q11.2 were specific for KA; the 16p11.2 locus showed extensive pleiotropy. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we identified TBX6 as a driver for the CAKUT subphenotypes in the 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Progressive tissue fibrosis is a major cause of the morbidity and mortality associated with repeated epithelial injuries and accumulation of myofibroblasts. Successful treatment options are limited by an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate myofibroblast accumulation. Here, we employed in vivo lineage tracing and real-time gene expression transgenic reporting methods to analyze the early embryonic transcription factor T-box gene 4 (TBX4), and determined that TBX4-lineage mesenchymal progenitors are the predominant source of myofibroblasts in injured adult lung. In a murine model, ablation of TBX4-expressing cells or disruption of TBX4 signaling attenuated lung fibrosis after bleomycin-induced injury. Furthermore, TBX4 regulated hyaluronan synthase 2 production to enable fibroblast invasion of matrix both in murine models and in fibroblasts from patients with severe pulmonary fibrosis. These data identify TBX4 as a mesenchymal transcription factor that drives accumulation of myofibroblasts and the development of lung fibrosis. Targeting TBX4 and downstream factors that regulate fibroblast invasiveness could lead to therapeutic approaches in lung fibrosis.",

The special condition of in utero development in mammals has presented challenges to developmental biologists in tracing cell lineages but modern imaging and cell marking techniques have allowed the gradual elucidation of lineage relationships. Early experimental embryology approaches had limited resolution and relied of suboptimal cell markers and considerable disturbance to the embryos. Transgenic technology introduced genetic markers, particularly fluorescent proteins that, combined with sophisticated imaging modalities, greatly increase resolution and allow clonal analysis within lineages. The concept of cell lineage has also undergone evolution as it became possible to trace the lineage of cells based not only on their physical location or attributes but also on their gene expression pattern, thus opening up mechanistic lines of investigation into the determinants of cell lineage.",

        "Abstract": "Gata4 and Gata6 are closely related transcription factors that are essential for the development of a number of embryonic tissues. While they have nearly identical DNA-binding domains and similar patterns of expression, Gata4 and Gata6 null embryos have strikingly different embryonic lethal phenotypes. To determine whether the lack of redundancy is due to differences in protein function or Gata4 and Gata6 expression domains, we generated mice that contained the Gata6 cDNA in place of the Gata4 genomic locus. Gata4(Gata6/Gata6) embryos survived through embryonic day (E)12.5 and successfully underwent ventral folding morphogenesis, demonstrating that Gata6 is able to replace Gata4 function in extraembryonic tissues. Surprisingly, Gata6 is unable to replace Gata4 function in the septum transversum mesenchyme or the epicardium, leading to liver agenesis and lethal heart defects in Gata4(Gata6/Gata6) embryos. These studies suggest that Gata4 has evolved distinct functions in the development of these tissues that cannot be performed by Gata6, even when it is provided in the identical expression domain. Our work has important implications for the respective mechanisms of Gata function during development, as well as the functional evolution of these essential transcription factors.",

        "Abstract": "The maintenance and control of pluripotency is of great interest in stem cell biology. The dual specificity T-box/basic-helix-loop-helix-zipper transcription factor Mga is expressed in the pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) and epiblast of the peri-implantation mouse embryo, but its function has not been investigated previously. Here, we use a loss-of-function allele and RNA knockdown to demonstrate that Mga depletion leads to the death of proliferating pluripotent ICM cells in vivo and in vitro, and the death of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro. Additionally, quiescent pluripotent cells lacking Mga are lost during embryonic diapause. Expression of Odc1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of ornithine into putrescine in the synthesis of polyamines, is reduced in Mga mutant cells, and the survival of mutant ICM cells as well as ESCs is rescued in culture by the addition of exogenous putrescine. These results suggest a mechanism whereby Mga influences pluripotent cell survival through regulation of the polyamine pool in pluripotent cells of the embryo, whether they are in a proliferative or quiescent state.",

In addition, although early studies focused on the role of T-box factors in early embryogenesis, recent studies in mice have uncovered additional roles in unsuspected places, for example in adult stem cell populations. Here, I provide an overview of the key features of T-box transcription factors and highlight their roles and mechanisms of action during various stages of development and in stem/progenitor cell populations.",

        "Abstract": "Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the founder cells of the germline. Via gametogenesis and fertilisation this lineage generates a new embryo in the next generation. PGCs are also the cell of origin of multilineage teratocarcinomas. In vitro, mouse PGCs can give rise to embryonic germ (EG) cells - pluripotent stem cells that can contribute to primary chimaeras when introduced into pre-implantation embryos. Thus, PGCs can give rise to pluripotent cells in the course of the developmental cycle, during teratocarcinogenesis and by in vitro culture. However, there is no evidence that PGCs can differentiate directly into somatic cell types. Furthermore, it is generally assumed that PGCs do not contribute to chimaeras following injection into the early mouse embryo. However, these data have never been formally published. Here, we present the primary data from the original PGC-injection experiments performed 40 years ago, alongside results from more recent studies in three separate laboratories. These results have informed and influenced current models of the relationship between pluripotency and the germline cycle. Current technologies allow further experiments to confirm and expand upon these findings and allow definitive conclusions as to the developmental potency of PGCs.",

        "Abstract": "Normal development of germ cells is essential for fertility and mammalian reproduction. Although abnormal development of oocytes or follicles may lead to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), a disorder that causes infertility in 1% of women less than 40 yr of age, the genes and signaling pathways activated in POI are not as yet fully elucidated. Tbx4, a member of the T-box family of transcription factors, is expressed in embryonic germ cells and postnatal oocytes at all stages of folliculogenesis. To investigate the requirement for Tbx4 in the germline, we analyzed germ cell development in the absence of Tbx4. We show that primordial germ cells (PGCs) are reduced in Tbx4 homozygous null (Tbx4(-/-)) embryos at Embryonic Day (E) 10.0. Tbx4(-/-) embryos die by E10.5; to study later time points in vitro, a tamoxifen-inducible estrogen receptor Cre recombinase was used to delete Tbx4 conditional mutant alleles. In addition, Gdf9cre and Zp3cre, two oocyte-specific Cre recombinases, were used to delete Tbx4 from postnatal primordial and primary follicles, respectively. We show that in vitro differentiation of the gonad into morphologically distinct testes and ovaries occurs normally starting at E11.5 when Tbx4 is deleted. In Gdf9cre; Tbx4(fl/-) and Zp3cre; Tbx4(fl/-) adult females, primordial, primary, secondary, and antral follicles form, ovulation occurs, corpus luteum formation is normal, and the mice are fertile without any evidence of diminished ovarian reserve. Although postnatal deletion of Tbx4 in oocytes does not obviously impair fertility, it is possible that the reduction in PGCs observed in Tbx4 homozygous null mutant embryos could affect long-term fertility in adults.",

        "Abstract": "Members of the T-box family of transcription factors are important regulators orchestrating the complex regionalization of the developing mammalian heart. Individual mutations in Tbx20 and Tbx3 cause distinct congenital heart abnormalities in the mouse: Tbx20 mutations result in failure of heart looping, developmental arrest and lack of chamber differentiation, while hearts of Tbx3 mutants progress further, loop normally but show atrioventricular convergence and outflow tract defects. The two genes have overlapping areas of expression in the atrioventricular canal and outflow tract of the heart but their potential genetic interaction has not been previously investigated. In this study we produced compound mutants to investigate potential genetic interactions at the earliest stages of heart development. We find that Tbx20; Tbx3 double heterozygous mice are viable and fertile with no apparent abnormalities, while double homozygous mutants are embryonic lethal by midgestation. Double homozygous mutant embryos display abnormal cardiac morphogenesis, lack of heart looping, expression patterns of cardiac genes and time of death that are indistinguishable from Tbx20 homozygous mutants. Prior to death, the double homozygotes show an overall developmental delay similar to Tbx3 homozygous mutants. Thus the effects of Tbx20 are epistatic to Tbx3 in the heart but Tbx3 is epistatic to Tbx20 with respect to developmental delay.",

        "Abstract": "Bmp4 expression is tightly regulated during embryonic tooth development, with early expression in the dental epithelial placode leading to later expression in the dental mesenchyme. Msx1 is among several transcription factors that are induced by epithelial Bmp4 and that, in turn, are necessary for the induction and maintenance of dental mesenchymal Bmp4 expression. Thus, Msx1(-/-) teeth arrest at early bud stage and show loss of Bmp4 expression in the mesenchyme. Ectopic expression of Bmp4 rescues this bud stage arrest. We have identified Tbx2 expression in the dental mesenchyme at bud stage and show that this can be induced by epithelial Bmp4. We also show that endogenous Tbx2 and Msx1 can physically interact in mouse C3H10T1/2 cells. In order to ascertain a functional relationship between Msx1 and Tbx2 in tooth development, we crossed Tbx2 and Msx1 mutant mice. Our data show that the bud stage tooth arrest in Msx1(-/-) mice is partially rescued in Msx1(-/-);Tbx2(+/-) compound mutants. This rescue is accompanied by formation of the enamel knot (EK) and by restoration of mesenchymal Bmp4 expression. Finally, knockdown of Tbx2 in C3H10T1/2 cells results in an increase in Bmp4 expression. Together, these data identify a novel role for Tbx2 in tooth development and suggest that, following their induction by epithelial Bmp4, Msx1 and Tbx2 in turn antagonistically regulate odontogenic activity that leads to EK formation and to mesenchymal Bmp4 expression at the key bud-to-cap stage transition.",

        "Abstract": "TBX2 and TBX3, closely related members of the T-box family of transcription factor genes, are expressed in mammary tissue in both humans and mice. Ulnar mammary syndrome (UMS), an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in TBX3, underscores the importance of TBX3 in human breast development, while abnormal mammary gland development in Tbx2 or Tbx3 mutant mice provides models for experimental investigation. In addition to their roles in mammary development, aberrant expression of TBX2 and TBX3 is associated with breast cancer. TBX2 is preferentially amplified in BRCA1/2-associated breast cancers and TBX3 overexpression has been associated with advanced stage disease and estrogen-receptor-positive breast tumors. The regulation of Tbx2 and Tbx3 and the downstream targets of these genes in development and disease are not as yet fully elucidated. However, it is clear that the two genes play unique, context-dependent roles both in mammary gland development and in mammary tumorigenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Danforth's short tail mutant (Sd) mouse, first described in 1930, is a classic spontaneous mutant exhibiting defects of the axial skeleton, hindgut, and urogenital system. We used meiotic mapping in 1,497 segregants to localize the mutation to a 42.8-kb intergenic segment on chromosome 2. Resequencing of this region identified an 8.5-kb early retrotransposon (ETn) insertion within the highly conserved regulatory sequences upstream of Pancreas Specific Transcription Factor, 1a (Ptf1a). This mutation resulted in up to tenfold increased expression of Ptf1a as compared to wild-type embryos at E9.5 but no detectable changes in the expression levels of other neighboring genes. At E9.5, Sd mutants exhibit ectopic Ptf1a expression in embryonic progenitors of every organ that will manifest a developmental defect: the notochord, the hindgut, and the mesonephric ducts. Moreover, at E 8.5, Sd mutant mice exhibit ectopic Ptf1a expression in the lateral plate mesoderm, tail bud mesenchyme, and in the notochord, preceding the onset of visible defects such as notochord degeneration. The Sd heterozygote phenotype was not ameliorated by Ptf1a haploinsufficiency, further suggesting that the developmental defects result from ectopic expression of Ptf1a. These data identify disruption of the spatio-temporal pattern of Ptf1a expression as the unifying mechanism underlying the multiple congenital defects in Danforth's short tail mouse. This striking example of an enhancer mutation resulting in profound developmental defects suggests that disruption of conserved regulatory elements may also contribute to human malformation syndromes.",

        "Abstract": "Loss of Tbx4 results in absence of chorio-allantoic fusion and failure of formation of the primary vascular plexus of the allantois leading to embryonic death at E10.5. We reviewed the literature for genes implicated in chorio-allantoic fusion, cavitation and vascular plexus formation, processes affected in Tbx4 mutant allantoises. Using this candidate gene approach, we identified a number of genes downstream of Tbx4 in the allantois including extracellular matrix molecules Vcan, Has2, and Itg\u03b15, transcription factors Snai1 and Twist, and signaling molecules Bmp2, Bmp7, Notch2, Jag1 and Wnt2. In addition, we show that the canonical Wnt signaling pathway contributes to the vessel-forming potential of the allantois. Ex vivo, the Tbx4 mutant phenotype can be rescued using agonists of the Wnt signaling pathway and, in wildtype allantoises, an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway disrupts vascular plexus formation. In vivo, Tbx4 and Wnt2 double heterozygous placentas show decreased vasculature suggesting interactions between Tbx4 and the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the process of allantois-derived blood vessel formation.",

        "Title": "Multiple roles and interactions of Tbx4 and Tbx5 in development of the respiratory system.",
        "Abstract": "Normal development of the respiratory system is essential for survival and is regulated by multiple genes and signaling pathways. Both Tbx4 and Tbx5 are expressed throughout the mesenchyme of the developing lung and trachea; and, although multiple genes are known to be required in the epithelium, only Fgfs have been well studied in the mesenchyme. In this study, we investigated the roles of Tbx4 and Tbx5 in lung and trachea development using conditional mutant alleles and two different Cre recombinase transgenic lines. Loss of Tbx5 leads to a unilateral loss of lung bud specification and absence of tracheal specification in organ culture. Mutants deficient in Tbx4 and Tbx5 show severely reduced lung branching at mid-gestation. Concordant with this defect, the expression of mesenchymal markers Wnt2 and Fgf10, as well as Fgf10 target genes Bmp4 and Spry2, in the epithelium is downregulated. Lung branching undergoes arrest ex vivo when Tbx4 and Tbx5 are both completely lacking. Lung-specific Tbx4 heterozygous;Tbx5 conditional null mice die soon after birth due to respiratory distress. These pups have small lungs and show severe disruptions in tracheal/bronchial cartilage rings. Sox9, a master regulator of cartilage formation, is expressed in the trachea; but mesenchymal cells fail to condense and consequently do not develop cartilage normally at birth. Tbx4;Tbx5 double heterozygous mutants show decreased lung branching and fewer tracheal cartilage rings, suggesting a genetic interaction. Finally, we show that Tbx4 and Tbx5 interact with Fgf10 during the process of lung growth and branching but not during tracheal/bronchial cartilage development.",

        "Abstract": "The allantois is the embryonic precursor of the umbilical cord in mammals and is one of several embryonic regions, including the yolk sac and dorsal aorta, that undergoes vasculogenesis, the de novo formation of blood vessels. Despite its importance in establishing the chorioallantoic placenta and umbilical circulation, the allantois frequently is overlooked in embryologic studies. Nonetheless, recent studies demonstrate that vasculogenesis, vascular remodeling, and angiogenesis are essential allantois functions in the establishment of the chorioallantoic placenta. Here, we review blood vessel formation in the murine allantois, highlighting the expression of genes and involvement of pathways common to vasculogenesis or angiogenesis in other parts of the embryo. We discuss experimental techniques available for manipulation of the allantois that are unavailable for yolk sac or dorsal aorta, and review how this system has been used as a model system to discover new genes and mechanisms involved in vessel formation. Finally, we discuss the potential of the allantois as a model system to provide insights into disease and therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Paraxial mesoderm is the tissue which gives rise to the skeletal muscles and vertebral column of the body. A gene regulatory network operating in the formation of paraxial mesoderm has been described. This network hinges on three key factors, Wnt3a, Msgn1 and Tbx6, each of which is critical for paraxial mesoderm formation, since absence of any one of these factors results in complete absence of posterior somites. In this study we determined and compared the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of Wnt3a, Msgn1 and Tbx6 at a time when paraxial mesoderm is being formed. Then, we performed a comparative characterization of mutants in Wnt3a, Msgn1 and Tbx6. To determine the epistatic relationship between these three genes, and begin to decipher the complex interplay between them, we analyzed double mutant embryos and compared their phenotypes to the single mutants. Through the analysis of molecular markers in mutants, our data support the bipotential nature of the progenitor cells for paraxial mesoderm and establish regulatory relationships between genes involved in the choice between neural and mesoderm fates.",

        "Abstract": "TBX3, a member of the T-box transcription factor gene family, is a transcriptional repressor that is required for the development of the heart, limbs, and mammary glands. Mutations in TBX3 that result in reduced functional protein lead to ulnar-mammary syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by limb, mammary gland, tooth, and genital abnormalities. Increased levels of TBX3 have been shown to contribute to the oncogenic process, and TBX3 is overexpressed in several cancers, including breast cancer, liver cancer, and melanoma. Despite its important role in development and postnatal life, little is known about the signaling pathways that modulate TBX3 expression. Here we show, using in vitro and in vivo assays, that retinoic acid (RA) activates endogenous TBX3 expression, which is mediated by an RA-receptor complex directly binding and activating the TBX3 promoter, and we provide evidence that this regulation may be functionally relevant in mouse embryonic limb development. Our data identify TBX3 as a direct target of the RA signaling pathway and extend our understanding of the role and regulation of TBX3 in limb development.",

        "Abstract": "The T-box transcription factor Tbx3 plays multiple roles in normal development and disease. In order to function in different tissues and on different target genes, Tbx3 binds transcription factors or other cofactors specific to temporal or spatial locations. Examining the development of the mammary gland, limbs, and heart as well as the biology of stem cells and cancer provides insights into the diverse and common functions that Tbx3 can perform. By either repressing or activating transcription of target genes in a context-dependent manner, Tbx3 is able to modulate differentiation of immature progenitor cells, control the rate of cell proliferation, and mediate cellular signaling pathways. Because the direct regulators of these cellular processes are highly context-dependent, it is essential that Tbx3 has the flexibility to regulate transcription of a large group of targets, but only become a active on a small cohort of them at any given time or place. Moreover, Tbx3 must be responsive to the variety of different upstream factors that are present in different tissues. Only by understanding the network of genes, proteins, and molecules with which Tbx3 interacts can we hope to understand the role that Tbx3 plays in normal development and how its aberrant expression can lead to disease. Because of its myriad functions in disparate developmental and disease contexts, Tbx3 is an ideal candidate for a systems-based approach to genetic function and interaction.",

        "Abstract": "The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common microdeletion disorder and is characterized by abnormal development of the pharyngeal apparatus and heart. Cardiovascular malformations (CVMs) affecting the outflow tract (OFT) are frequently observed in 22q11.2DS and are among the most commonly occurring heart defects. The gene encoding T-box transcription factor 1 (Tbx1) has been identified as a major candidate for 22q11.2DS. However, CVMs are generally considered to have a multigenic basis and single-gene mutations underlying these malformations are rare. The T-box family members Tbx2 and Tbx3 are individually required in regulating aspects of OFT and pharyngeal development. Here, using expression and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis, we show that Tbx1 and Tbx2/Tbx3 are largely uniquely expressed but overlap in the caudal pharyngeal mesoderm during OFT development, suggesting potential combinatorial requirements. Cross-regulation between Tbx1 and Tbx2/Tbx3 was analyzed using mouse genetics and revealed that Tbx1 deficiency affects Tbx2 and Tbx3 expression in neural crest-derived cells and pharyngeal mesoderm, whereas Tbx2 and Tbx3 function redundantly upstream of Tbx1 and Hh ligand expression in pharyngeal endoderm and bone morphogenetic protein- and fibroblast growth factor-signaling in cardiac progenitors. Moreover, in vivo, we show that loss of two of the three genes results in severe pharyngeal hypoplasia and heart tube extension defects. These findings reveal an indispensable T-box gene network governing pharyngeal and OFT development and identify TBX2 and TBX3 as potential modifier genes of the cardiopharyngeal phenotypes found in TBX1-haploinsufficient 22q11.2DS patients.",

        "Abstract": "FoxO1 integrates multiple metabolic pathways. Nutrient levels modulate FoxO1 acetylation, but the functional consequences of this posttranslational modification are unclear. To answer this question, we generated mice bearing alleles that encode constitutively acetylated and acetylation-defective FoxO1 proteins. Homozygosity for an allele mimicking constitutive acetylation (Foxo1(KQ/KQ)) results in embryonic lethality due to cardiac and angiogenesis defects. In contrast, mice homozygous for\u00a0a constitutively deacetylated Foxo1 allele (Foxo1(KR/KR)) display a unique metabolic phenotype of impaired insulin action on hepatic glucose metabolism but decreased plasma lipid levels and low respiratory quotient that are consistent with a state of preferential lipid usage. Moreover, Foxo1(KR/KR) mice show\u00a0a dissociation between weight gain and insulin resistance in predisposing conditions (high fat diet, diabetes, and insulin receptor mutations), possibly due to decreased cytokine production in adipose tissue. Thus, acetylation inactivates FoxO1 during nutrient excess whereas deacetylation selectively potentiates FoxO1 activity, protecting against excessive catabolism during nutrient deprivation.",

        "Abstract": "T-box gene Tbx4 is critical for the formation of the umbilicus and the initiation of the hindlimb. Previous studies show broad expression in the allantois, hindlimb, lung and proctodeum. We have examined the expression of Tbx4 in detail and used a Tbx4-Cre line to trace the fates of Tbx4-expressing cells. Tbx4 expression and lineage reveal that various distinct appendages, such as the allantois, hindlimb, and external genitalia, all arise from a single mesenchymal expression domain. Additionally, although Tbx4 is associated primarily with the hindlimb, we find two forelimb expression domains. Most notably, we find that, despite the requirement for Tbx4 in allantoic vasculogenesis, the presumptive endothelial cells of the allantois do not express Tbx4 and lineage tracing reveals that the umbilical vasculature never expresses Tbx4. These results suggest that endothelial lineages are segregated before the onset of vasculogenesis, and demonstrate a role for the peri-vascular tissue in vasculogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Tbx2 and Tbx3 are closely related members of the T-box family of transcription factors that are important regulators during normal development as well as major contributors to human developmental syndromes when mutated. Although there is evidence for the involvement of Tbx2 and Tbx3 in pancreatic cancer, so far there are no reports characterizing the normal expression pattern of these genes in the pancreas. In this study, we examined spatial and temporal expression of Tbx2 and Tbx3 in mouse pancreas during development and in the adult using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Our results show that Tbx2 and Tbx3 are both expressed in the pancreatic mesenchyme throughout development beginning at embryonic day (E) 9.5. In addition, Tbx2 is expressed in pancreatic vasculature during development and in epithelial-derived endocrine and ductal cells during late fetal stages, postnatal development and in adult pancreas. In contrast, Tbx3 is expressed in exocrine tissue in the postnatal and adult pancreas. Further our results demonstrate that Tbx2 and Tbx3 are expressed in tumor-derived endocrine and exocrine cell lines, respectively. These dynamic changes in the expression pattern of these transcription factors lay the foundation for investigation of potential roles in pancreas development.",

        "Abstract": "We report the derivation and characterization of two new human embryonic stem cells (hESC) lines (CU1 and CU2) from embryos with an irreversible loss of integrated organismic function. In addition, we analyzed retrospective data of morphological progression from embryonic day (ED) 5 to ED6 for 2480 embryos not suitable for clinical use to assess grading criteria indicative of loss of viability on ED5. Our analysis indicated that a large proportion of in vitro fertilization (IVF) embryos not suitable for clinical use could be used for hESC derivation. Based on these combined findings, we propose that criteria commonly used in IVF clinics to determine optimal embryos for uterine transfer can be employed to predict the potential for hESC derivation from poor quality embryos without the destruction of vital human embryos.",

        "Title": "Tbx6-dependent Sox2 regulation determines neural or mesodermal fate in axial stem cells.",
        "Abstract": "The classical view of neural plate development held that it arises from the ectoderm, after its separation from the mesodermal and endodermal lineages. However, recent cell-lineage-tracing experiments indicate that the caudal neural plate and paraxial mesoderm are generated from common bipotential axial stem cells originating from the caudal lateral epiblast. Tbx6 null mutant mouse embryos which produce ectopic neural tubes at the expense of paraxial mesoderm must provide a clue to the regulatory mechanism underlying this neural versus mesodermal fate choice. Here we demonstrate that Tbx6-dependent regulation of Sox2 determines the fate of axial stem cells. In wild-type embryos, enhancer N1 of the neural primordial gene Sox2 is activated in the caudal lateral epiblast, and the cells staying in the superficial layer sustain N1 activity and activate Sox2 expression in the neural plate. In contrast, the cells destined to become mesoderm activate Tbx6 and turn off enhancer N1 before migrating into the paraxial mesoderm compartment. In Tbx6 mutant embryos, however, enhancer N1 activity persists in the paraxial mesoderm compartment, eliciting ectopic Sox2 activation and transforming the paraxial mesoderm into neural tubes. An enhancer-N1-specific deletion mutation introduced into Tbx6 mutant embryos prevented this Sox2 activation in the mesodermal compartment and subsequent development of ectopic neural tubes, indicating that Tbx6 regulates Sox2 via enhancer N1. Tbx6-dependent repression of Wnt3a in the paraxial mesodermal compartment is implicated in this regulatory process. Paraxial mesoderm-specific misexpression of a Sox2 transgene in wild-type embryos resulted in ectopic neural tube development. Thus, Tbx6 represses Sox2 by inactivating enhancer N1 to inhibit neural development, and this is an essential step for the specification of paraxial mesoderm from the axial stem cells.",

        "Abstract": "Development of the mammalian heart is mediated by complex interactions between myocardial, endocardial, and neural crest-derived cells. Studies in Drosophila have shown that the Slit-Robo signaling pathway controls cardiac cell shape changes and lumen formation of the heart tube. Here, we demonstrate by in situ hybridization that multiple Slit ligands and Robo receptors are expressed in the developing mouse heart. Slit3 is the predominant ligand transcribed in the early mouse heart and is expressed in the ventral wall of the linear heart tube and subsequently in chamber but not in atrioventricular canal myocardium. Furthermore, we identify that the homeobox gene Nkx2-5 is required for early ventral restriction of Slit3 and that the T-box transcription factor Tbx2 mediates repression of Slit3 in nonchamber myocardium. Our results suggest that patterned Slit-Robo signaling may contribute to the control of oriented cell growth during chamber morphogenesis of the mammalian heart.",

        "Abstract": "Proper functioning of the musculoskeletal system requires the precise integration of bones, muscles, and tendons. Complex morphogenetic events ensure that these elements are linked together in the appropriate three-dimensional configuration. It has been difficult, however, to tease apart the mechanisms that regulate tissue morphogenesis. We find that deletion of Tbx5 in forelimbs (or Tbx4 in hindlimbs) specifically affects muscle and tendon patterning without disrupting skeletal development, thus suggesting that distinct cues regulate these processes. We identify muscle connective tissue as the site of action of these transcription factors and show that N-Cadherin and beta-Catenin are key downstream effectors acting in muscle connective tissue and regulating soft-tissue morphogenesis. In humans, TBX5 mutations lead to Holt-Oram syndrome, which is characterized by forelimb musculoskeletal defects. Our results suggest that a focus on connective tissue is required to understand the etiology of diseases affecting soft tissue formation.",

        "Abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) mellitus is characterized by progressive autoimmune destruction of insulin producing beta-cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Cure of the disease will require control of autoimmunity to halt the destruction of beta-cells in the pancreas and restoration of beta-cell mass. We have built on the success of preclinical and clinical trials of anti-CD3 antibody treatment in modulating the immune response of T1D by the induction of tolerance and combined this treatment, using the nonobese diabetic mouse model, with a transplantation approach using fetal pancreatic anlagen as a source of beta-cell precursor or progenitor cells. Here we report that transplantation of pancreatic anlagen into diabetic nonobese diabetic mice rendered tolerant to the autoimmune process by treatment with anti-CD3 antibody resulted in long-term recovery from diabetes with restored metabolic control. Using a green fluorescent protein marker that made it possible to unequivocally identify the cells derived from the transplanted tissue, we show that the transplanted anlagen cells migrate to the host pancreas and provide a major source of insulin leading to restoration of normal glucose tolerance. Our results contrast with other studies that showed restoration of endogenous islets after infusion of spleen cells in mice treated with Freund's complete adjuvant and suggest that pancreatic fetal tissue has a tropism for the pancreatic site. This study suggests a novel mechanism of beta-cell restoration by the migration of precursor cells or their progeny to the host pancreas and highlights the feasibility of using pancreatic precursors in combination with immune modulation as a treatment to effect long-term remission of T1D.",

        "Title": "Loss of Tbx2 delays optic vesicle invagination leading to small optic cups.",
        "Abstract": "Tbx2 is a T-box transcription factor gene that is dynamically expressed in the presumptive retina during optic vesicle invagination. Several findings implicate Tbx2 in cell cycle regulation, including its overexpression in tumours and regulation of proliferation during heart development. We investigated the role of Tbx2 in optic cup formation by analysing mice with a targeted homozygous mutation in Tbx2. Loss of Tbx2 caused a reduced presumptive retinal volume due to increased apoptosis, and a delay in ventral optic vesicle invagination leading to the formation of small and abnormally shaped optic cups. Tbx2 is essential for maintenance, but not induction of expression of the dorsal retinal determinant, Tbx5, and acts downstream of Bmp4, a dorsally expressed gene implicated in human microphthalmia. The small retina showed a hypocellular ventral region, loss of Fgf15, normally expressed in proliferating central retinal cells, and increased numbers of mitotic cells in the dorsal region, indicating that Tbx2 is required for normal growth and development across the D-V axis. Dorsal expression of potential regulators of retinal growth, Cyp1b1 and Cx43, and the topographic guidance molecule ephrinB2, was increased, and intraretinal axons were disorganised resulting in a failure of optic nerve formation. Our data provide evidence that Tbx2 is required for proper optic cup formation and plays a critical early role in regulating regional retinal growth and the acquisition of shape during optic vesicle invagination.",

        "Abstract": "Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) hold great promise for use in regenerative medicine. However, the extraordinary potential of hESC as therapeutic tools is tempered by ethical, moral and political issues surrounding their derivation from human embryos. It has previously been proposed that ethical criteria applied to essential organ donation could be employed for derivation of hESC from irreversibly arrested, and thus organismically dead, human embryos produced during routine IVF procedures. Here, it is shown that arrested embryos do not resume normal development during extended culture, yet most of them contain a substantial number of living cells on embryonic day 6 (72% have <1 viable cell, 47% have <5 viable cells), suggesting that this class of non-viable embryos could be a rich source of viable cells for derivation of hESC lines.",

        "Title": "Promotion of beta-cell differentiation in pancreatic precursor cells by adult islet cells.",
        "Abstract": "It is thought that differentiation of beta-cell precursors into mature cells is largely autonomous, but under certain conditions differentiation can be modified by external factors. The factors that modify beta-cell differentiation have not been identified. In this study, we tested whether adult islet cells can affect the differentiation process in mouse and human pancreatic anlage cells. We assessed beta-cell proliferation and differentiation in mouse and human pancreatic anlage cells cocultured with adult islet cells or betaTC3 cells using cellular, molecular, and immunohistochemical methods. Differentiation of murine anlage cells into beta-cells was induced by mature islet cells. It was specific for beta-cells and not a general feature of endodermal derived cells. beta-Cell differentiation required cell-cell contact. The induced cells acquired features of mature beta-cells including increased expression of beta-cell transcription factors and surface expression of receptor for stromal cell-derived factor 1 and glucose transporter-2 (GLUT-2). They secreted insulin in response to glucose and could correct hyperglycemia in vivo when cotransplanted with vascular cells. Human pancreatic anlage cells responded in a similar manner and showed increased expression of pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 and v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A and increased production of proinsulin when cocultured with adult islets. We conclude that mature beta-cells can modify the differentiation of precursor cells and suggest a mechanism whereby changes in differentiation of beta-cells can be affected by other beta-cells.",

With the phase of T-box gene discovery winding down, the phase of transcriptional target discovery for T-box transcription factors is finally taking off and yielding rich rewards. Mutant phenotypes in mouse and zebrafish as well as morpholino studies in zebrafish have helped to link the T-box genes to a variety of signaling pathways through diverse target genes and feedback loops. Particularly in early mesoderm development, it is emerging that a network of T-box genes interacts with Wnt/beta-catenin and Notch/Delta signaling pathways, among others, to control the important processes of mesoderm specification, somite segmentation, and left/right body axis determination.",

        "Abstract": "Conotruncal and ventricular septal congenital heart anomalies result from defects in formation and division of the embryonic outflow tract. Cardiac remodeling during outflow tract and ventricular septation converts the tubular embryonic heart into a parallel circulatory system with an independent left ventricular outlet and right ventricular inlet. Tbx3 encodes a T-box-containing transcription factor expressed in the developing conduction system of the heart. Mutations in TBX3 cause ulnar-mammary syndrome. Here we show that mice lacking Tbx3 develop severe outflow tract defects, including connection of both the aorta and pulmonary trunk with the right ventricle, in addition to aortic arch artery anomalies and abnormal communication between the right atrium and left ventricle. Alignment defects are preceded by a delay in caudal displacement of the arterial pole of the heart during aortic arch artery formation. Embryonic anterior-posterior patterning and cardiac chamber development are unaffected in Tbx3 mutant embryos. However, the contribution of second heart field derived progenitor cells to the arterial pole of the heart is impaired. Tbx3 is expressed in pharyngeal epithelia and neural crest cells in the pharyngeal region, suggesting an indirect role in second heart field deployment. Loss of Tbx3 affects multiple signaling pathways regulating second heart field proliferation and outflow tract morphogenesis, including fibroblast growth factor signaling, leading to a failure of normal heart tube extension and consequent atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial alignment defects.",

We examine three previously described cre alleles and find that Cre activity alone causes dramatic developmental defects, such as loss of hematopoietic activity and dramatically upregulated apoptosis in many embryonic tissues in two of these lines. These results demonstrate that cre expression generates spurious phenotypes that can confound genetics analyses. We also find that most recently published studies fail to include cre-positive controls, and thus may have attributed roles to a targeted gene, which were in reality partly or wholly due to Cre toxicity. This information will be critical in both evaluating previously published work using cre alleles and in designing future experiments.",

        "Abstract": "Transgene insertion is instrumental to identifying genes with defined physiological functions. In this paper, we show that mice homozygous for either TM1 or TM2, two mutant alleles with distinct transgene insertions, exhibited embryo lethality, suggesting that these two alleles play essential roles in embryogenesis. Interestingly, although hemizygous TM1 or TM2 alone did not have obvious alteration in thymocyte development, together, they exhibited a compound effect on thymocyte development, blocking the development from CD4 and CD8 double-negative to double-positive stage of T cells. TM1 and TM2 mutations were mapped to chromosome regions 7E-F1 and 11B5-C, respectively, where we could not identify any known gene that was implicated in a similar function. Thus, TM1 and TM2 represent two novel alleles that define a genetic trait controlling thymocyte development.",

        "Abstract": "Tbx1, the major gene underlying del22q11.2 or DiGeorge syndrome in humans, is required for normal development and septation of the cardiac outflow tract. The fibroblast growth factor 10 gene (Fgf10) and an Fgf10 enhancer trap transgene are expressed in outflow tract myocardial progenitor cells of the anterior heart field. To visualize outflow tract development in the absence of Tbx1, we have analyzed the expression profile of the Fgf10 enhancer trap transgene during outflow tract development in Tbx1(-/-) embryos. Transgene expression confirms hypoplasia of the distal outflow tract in the absence of Tbx1, and altered expression in pharyngeal mesoderm reveals loss of specific bilateral subpopulations of outflow tract progenitor cells and disruption of the posterior boundary of the anterior heart field. Our results support the conclusion that Tbx1 controls deployment of Fgf10-expressing progenitor cells during heart tube extension. Furthermore, although normal Fgf10 levels are dependent on Tbx1, loss of Fgf10 alleles does not significantly modify the cardiac phenotype of Tbx1 heterozygous or homozygous mutant embryos.",

        "Title": "Molecular pathway for the localized formation of the sinoatrial node.",
        "Abstract": "The sinoatrial node, which resides at the junction of the right atrium and the superior caval vein, contains specialized myocardial cells that initiate the heart beat. Despite this fundamental role in heart function, the embryonic origin and mechanisms of localized formation of the sinoatrial node have not been defined. Here we show that subsequent to the formation of the Nkx2-5-positive heart tube, cells bordering the inflow tract of the heart tube give rise to the Nkx2-5-negative myocardial cells of the sinoatrial node and the sinus horns. Using genetic models, we show that as the myocardium of the heart tube matures, Nkx2-5 suppresses pacemaker channel gene Hcn4 and T-box transcription factor gene Tbx3, thereby enforcing a progressive confinement of their expression to the forming Nkx2-5-negative sinoatrial node and sinus horns. Thus, Nkx2-5 is essential for establishing a gene expression border between the atrium and sinoatrial node. Tbx3 was found to suppress chamber differentiation, providing an additional mechanism by which the Tbx3-positive sinoatrial node is shielded from differentiating into atrial myocardium. Pitx2c-deficient fetuses form sinoatrial nodes with indistinguishable molecular signatures at both the right and left sinuatrial junction, indicating that Pitx2c functions within the left/right pathway to suppress a default program for sinuatrial node formation on the left. Our molecular pathway provides a mechanism for how pacemaker activity becomes progressively relegated to the most recently added components of the venous pole of the heart and, ultimately, to the junction of the right atrium and superior caval vein.",

        "Abstract": "Tbx4 is a crucial gene in the initiation of hindlimb development and has been reported as a determinant of hindlimb identity and a presumptive direct regulator of Fgf10 in the limb. Using a conditional allele of Tbx4, we have ablated Tbx4 function before and after limb initiation. Ablation of Tbx4 before expression in the hindlimb field confirms its requirement for limb bud outgrowth. However, ablation of Tbx4 shortly after onset of expression in the hindlimb field, during limb bud formation, alters neither limb outgrowth nor expression of Fgf10. Instead, post-limb-initiation loss of Tbx4 results in reduction of limb core tissue and hypoplasia of proximal skeletal elements. Loss of Tbx4 during later limb outgrowth produces no limb defects, revealing a brief developmental requirement for Tbx4 function. Despite evidence from ectopic expression studies, our work establishes that loss of Tbx4 has no effect on hindlimb identity as assessed by morphology or molecular markers.",

        "Abstract": "Although we have advanced in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms intrinsic to the morphogenesis of chordate embryos, the question of how individual developmental events are integrated to generate the final morphological form is still unresolved. Microscopic observation is a pivotal tool in developmental biology, both for determining the normal course of events and for contrasting this with the results of experimental and pathological perturbations. Since embryonic development takes place in three dimensions over time, to fully understand the events required to build an embryo we must investigate embryo morphogenesis in multiple dimensions in situ. Recent advances in the isolation of naturally fluorescent proteins, and the refinement of techniques for in vivo microscopy offer unprecedented opportunities to study the cellular and molecular events within living, intact embryos using optical imaging. These technologies allow direct visual access to complex events as they happen in their native environment, and thus provide greater insights into cell behaviors operating during embryonic development. Since most fluorescent protein probes and modes of data acquisition are common across species, we have chosen the mouse and the ascidian, two model organisms at opposite ends of the chordate clade, to review the use of some of the current genetically-encoded fluorescent proteins and their visualization in vivo in living embryos for the generation of high-resolution imaging data.",

        "Abstract": "22q11 deletion (del22q11) syndrome is characterized genetically by heterozygous deletions within chromosome 22q11 and clinically by a constellation of congenital malformations of the aortic arch, heart, thymus, and parathyroid glands described as DiGeorge syndrome (DGS). Here, we report that compound heterozygosity of mouse homologs of two 22q11 genes, CRKL and TBX1, results in a striking increase in the penetrance and expressivity of a DGS-like phenotype compared to heterozygosity at either locus. Furthermore, we show that these two genes have critical dose-dependent functions in pharyngeal segmentation, patterning of the pharyngeal apparatus along the anteroposterior axis, and local regulation of retinoic acid (RA) metabolism and signaling. We can partially rescue one salient feature of DGS in Crkl+/-;Tbx1+/- embryos by genetically reducing the amount of RA produced in the embryo. Thus, we suggest that del22q11 is a contiguous gene syndrome involving dose-sensitive interaction of CRKL and TBX1 and locally aberrant RA signaling.",

        "Abstract": "The myriad developmental roles served by the T-box family of transcription factor genes defy easy categorization. Present in all metazoans, the T-box genes are involved in early embryonic cell fate decisions, regulation of the development of extraembryonic structures, embryonic patterning, and many aspects of organogenesis. They are unusual in displaying dosage sensitivity in most instances. In humans, mutations in T-box genes are responsible for developmental dysmorphic syndromes, and several T-box genes have been implicated in neoplastic processes. T-box transcription factors function in many different signaling pathways, notably bone morphogenetic protein and fibroblast growth factor pathways. The few downstream target genes that have been identified indicate a wide range of downstream effectors.",

        "Abstract": "Tetraploid (4n) mouse embryos die at variable developmental stages. By examining 4n embryos from F2 hybrid and outbred mice, we show that 4n developmental potential is influenced by genetic background. The imprinted inactivation of an X chromosome-linked eGFP transgene in extraembryonic tissues occurred correctly in 4n embryos. A decrease of the cleavage rate in 4n preimplantation embryos compared to diploid (2n) embryos was revealed by real-time imaging, using a histone H2b:eGFP reporter. It has previously been known that mouse chimeras produced by the combination of diploid (2n) embryos with embryonic stem (ES) cells result in mixtures of the two components in epiblast-derived tissues. In contrast, the use of 4n host embryos with ES cells restricts 4n cells from the embryonic regions of chimeras, resulting in mice that are believed to be completely ES-derived. Using H2b:eGFP transgenic mice and ES cells, the behavior of 4n cells was determined at single cell resolution in 4n:2n injection and aggregation chimeras. We found a significant contribution of 4n cells to the embryonic ectoderm at gastrulation in every chimera analyzed. We show that the transition of the embryonic regions from a chimeric tissue to a predominantly 2n tissue occurs after gastrulation and that tetraploid cells may persist to midgestation. These findings suggest that the results of previously published tetraploid complementation assays may be influenced by the presence of tetraploid cells in the otherwise diploid embryonic regions.",

        "Abstract": "The closely related T-box genes Tbx2 and Tbx3 are both expressed in the developing mammary glands of mouse embryos and both have been implicated in mammary carcinogenesis. Tbx3 is essential for induction of the mammary placodes in mice. In humans, mutations in TBX3 are responsible for ulnar-mammary syndrome. Here, we show a haploinsufficiency effect of Tbx3 on maintenance of the mammary placodes and on the extent of branching of the ductal tree in mice. Loss or heterozygosity for Tbx2, on the other hand, has no effect on either induction or maintenance of the placodes, although a small effect was seen on branching morphogenesis in adult heterozygotes. However, the deficiency in maintenance of the mammary placodes in Tbx2, Tbx3 double heterozygous mice is more marked than in Tbx3 single heterozygotes, indicating a genetic interaction between the two genes. In spite of a large body of evidence implicating these genes in cell cycle control through the p19(Arf)/p53 pathways, we find no evidence for involvement of these pathways either in embryonic lethality of homozygous mutants or in the mammary gland phenotype of Tbx3 heterozygous mice.",

        "Title": "The first cleavage of the mouse zygote predicts the blastocyst axis.",
        "Abstract": "One of the unanswered questions in mammalian development is how the embryonic-abembryonic axis of the blastocyst is first established. It is possible that the first cleavage division contributes to this process, because in most mouse embryos the progeny of one two-cell blastomere primarily populate the embryonic part of the blastocyst and the progeny of its sister populate the abembryonic part. However, it is not known whether the embryonic-abembryonic axis is set up by the first cleavage itself, by polarity in the oocyte that then sets the first cleavage plane with respect to the animal pole, or indeed whether it can be divorced entirely from the first cleavage and established in relation to the animal pole. Here we test the importance of the orientation of the first cleavage by imposing an elongated shape on the zygote so that the division no longer passes close to the animal pole, marked by the second polar body. Non-invasive lineage tracing shows that even when the first cleavage occurs along the short axis imposed by this experimental treatment, the progeny of the resulting two-cell blastomeres tend to populate the respective embryonic and abembryonic parts of the blastocyst. Thus, the first cleavage contributes to breaking the symmetry of the embryo, generating blastomeres with different developmental characteristics.",

        "Abstract": "Generation of inside cells that develop into inner cell mass (ICM) and outside cells that develop into trophectoderm is central to the development of the early mouse embryo. Critical to this decision is the development of cell polarity and the associated asymmetric (differentiative) divisions of the 8-cell-stage blastomeres. The underlying molecular mechanisms for these events are not understood. As the Par3/aPKC complex has a role in establishing cellular polarity and division orientation in other systems, we explored its potential function in the developing mouse embryo. We show that both Par3 and aPKC adopt a polarized localization from the 8-cell stage onwards and that manipulating their function re-directs cell positioning and consequently influences cell fate. Injection of dsRNA against Par3 or mRNA for a dominant negative form of aPKC into a random blastomere at the 4-cell stage directs progeny of the injected cell into the inside part of the embryo. This appears to result from both an increased frequency by which such cells undertake differentiative divisions and their decreased probability of retaining outside positions. Thus, the natural spatial allocation of blastomere progeny can be over-ridden by downregulation of Par3 or aPKC, leading to a deceased tendency for them to remain outside and so develop into trophectoderm. In addition, this experimental approach illustrates a powerful means of manipulating gene expression in a specific clonal population of cells in the preimplantation embryo.",

        "Abstract": "Tbx1 belongs to the family of T-box containing transcription factors. In humans, TBX1 is implicated in the etiology of the DiGeorge syndrome. Inactivation of the Tbx1 gene in mice produces a variety of malformations including abnormal branching of the heart outflow tract, deficiencies in the branchial arch derivatives, agenesis of pharyngeal glands and abnormal development of the auditory system. We analyze here the middle and inner ear phenotypes of the Tbx1 null mice. The middle ear is strongly affected. Its skeletal components are malformed to varying degrees, some being slightly hypoplastic and others completely absent. However, a seemingly normal-looking tympanic membrane can still be recognized. Middle ear anomalies are associated with other skeletal deficiencies in the branchial arch-derived skeleton. These phenotypes derive from a combination of the failure of the posterior branchial arches to develop and the misrouting of neural crest cells. The inner ears of Tbx1(-/-) animals are hypoplastic. No vestibular or cochlear structures are detectable, but the endolymphatic duct, the cochleovestibular ganglia and residual sensory patches are still identifiable. Molecular analyses revealed a seemingly normal spatial distribution of a variety of patterning markers in the otic vesicles of Tbx1 null mutants at E9.0. However, 1 day later, several of these markers presented altered domains of expression in the otocysts of these mutant embryos, suggesting that Tbx1 is not required for the establishment of spatial patterns in the otocyst, but rather for their maintenance. The inability of the Tbx1(-/-) embryos to keep properly segregated functional domains in the otocyst is likely the cause of the strong inner ear phenotypes observed in these mutants.",

        "Title": "Tbx2 is essential for patterning the atrioventricular canal and for morphogenesis of the outflow tract during heart development.",
        "Abstract": "Tbx2 is a member of the T-box transcription factor gene family, and is expressed in a variety of tissues and organs during embryogenesis. In the developing heart, Tbx2 is expressed in the outflow tract, inner curvature, atrioventricular canal and inflow tract, corresponding to a myocardial zone that is excluded from chamber differentiation at 9.5 days post coitus (dpc). We have used targeted mutagenesis in mice to investigate Tbx2 function. Mice heterozygous for a Tbx2 null mutation appear normal but homozygous embryos reveal a crucial role for Tbx2 during cardiac development. Morphological defects are observed in development of the atrioventricular canal and septation of the outflow tract. Molecular analysis reveals that Tbx2 is required to repress chamber differentiation in the atrioventricular canal at 9.5 dpc. Analysis of homozygous mutants also highlights a role for Tbx2 during hindlimb digit development. Despite evidence that TBX2 negatively regulates the cell cycle control genes Cdkn2a, Cdkn2b and Cdkn1a in cultured cells, there is no evidence that loss of Tbx2 function during mouse development results in increased levels of p19(ARF), p16(INK4a), p15(INK4b) or p21 expression in vivo, nor is there evidence for a genetic interaction between Tbx2 and p53.",

        "Title": "The del22q11.2 candidate gene Tbx1 regulates branchiomeric myogenesis.",
        "Abstract": "Formation and remodeling of the pharyngeal arches play central roles in craniofacial development. TBX1, encoding a T-box-containing transcription factor, is the major candidate gene for del22q11.2 (DiGeorge or velo-cardio-facial) syndrome, characterized by craniofacial defects, thymic hypoplasia, cardiovascular anomalies, velopharyngeal insufficiency and skeletal muscle hypotonia. Tbx1 is expressed in pharyngeal mesoderm, which gives rise to branchiomeric skeletal muscles of the head and neck. Although the genetic control of craniofacial muscle development is known to involve pathways distinct from those operational in the trunk, the regulation of branchiomeric myogenesis has remained enigmatic. Here we show that branchiomeric muscle development is severely perturbed in Tbx1 mutant mice. In the absence of Tbx1, the myogenic determination genes Myf5 and MyoD fail to be normally activated in pharyngeal mesoderm. Unspecified precursor cells expressing genes encoding the transcriptional repressors Capsulin and MyoR are present in the mandibular arch of Tbx1 mutant embryos. Sporadic activation of Myf5 and MyoD in these precursor cells results in the random presence or absence of hypoplastic mandibular arch-derived muscles at later developmental stages. Tbx1 is also required for normal expression of Tlx1 and Fgf10 in pharyngeal mesoderm, in addition to correct neural crest cell patterning in the mandibular arch. Tbx1 therefore regulates the onset of branchiomeric myogenesis and controls normal mandibular arch development, including robust transcriptional activation of myogenic determination genes. While no abnormalities in branchiomeric myogenesis were detected in Tbx1(+/-) mice, reduced TBX1 levels may contribute to pharyngeal hypotonia in del22q11.2 patients.",

        "Title": "Critical role for Tbx6 in mesoderm specification in the mouse embryo.",
        "Abstract": "Tbx6 is a member of the T-box family of transcription factor genes. Two mutant alleles of this gene establish that Tbx6 is involved in both the specification and patterning of the somites along the entire length of the embryo. The null allele, Tbx6(tm1Pa), causes abnormal patterning of the cervical somites and improper specification of more posterior paraxial mesoderm, such that it forms ectopic neural tubes. In this study, we use this allele to further investigate the mechanism of action of the Tbx6 gene and investigate possible genetic interactions. We have tested the developmental and differentiation potential of Tbx6(tm1Pa)/Tbx6(tm1Pa) cells in ectopic sites, in vitro, and in chimeras in vivo. We have also documented cell proliferation and cell death in mutant tail buds in an attempt to explain the mechanism of tail bud enlargement in the Tbx6 mutant embryos. Our results indicate specific developmental restrictions on the differentiation of posterior cells lacking Tbx6, once they have traversed the primitive streak, but no restrictions in differentiation of anterior somites, or of Tbx6 null embryonic stem (ES) cells. We further demonstrate that Tbx6 null ES cells fail to populate posterior somites in chimeric embryos. To discover whether different T-box proteins interact on the same down stream targets in areas of expression overlap, we have explored potential interactions between Tbx6 and T (Brachyury) in genetic crosses. Our results reveal that the T(Wis) mutation is epistatic to the Tbx6(tm1Pa) mutation and that there is no apparent genetic interaction. However, homozygosity for Tbx6(tm1Pa) and heterozygosity for T(Wis) mutation shows a combinatorial interaction at the phenotypic level.",

        "Abstract": "FGF4, a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, is absolutely required for periimplantation mouse development, although its precise role at this stage remains unknown. The nature of the defect leading to postimplantation lethality of embryos lacking zygotic FGF4 is unclear and little is known about downstream targets of FGF4-initiated signaling within the various cellular compartments of the blastocyst. Here we report that postimplantation lethality of Fgf4(-/-) embryos is unlikely to reflect strictly mitogenic requirements for FGF4. Rather, our results suggest that FGF4 is required to maintain trophectoderm and primitive endoderm identity at embryonic day 4.5. This result is consistent with the reported in vitro activity of FGF4 in maintaining trophoblast stem cells and with the requirement for receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in primitive endoderm formation. Thus, postimplantation lethality of Fgf4(-/-) embryos likely results from the failure of proper differentiation and function of extraembryonic cell types.",

        "Abstract": "Tbx4 is a member of the T-box family of transcription factor genes, which have been shown to play important roles in development. We have ablated Tbx4 function using targeted mutagenesis in the mouse. Embryos homozygous for the null allele fail to undergo chorioallantoic fusion and die by 10.5 days post coitus. The allantoises of Tbx4-mutant embryos are stunted, apoptotic and display abnormal differentiation. Endothelial cells within mutant allantoises do not undergo vascular remodeling. Heterozygous embryos show a mild, transient growth defect in the allantois. Induction of a hindlimb field occurs normally in Tbx4 mutants and initial patterning of the hindlimb bud appears normal. However, hindlimb buds from Tbx4 mutants fail to develop either in vivo or in vitro and do not maintain Fgf10 expression in the mesenchyme. The expression of another, closely-linked, T-box gene, Tbx2, is reduced in both the hindlimb and the allantois of Tbx4-mutant embryos prior to the development of overt morphological abnormalities, which suggests that Tbx4 regulates Tbx2 in these tissues.",

        "Abstract": "The TWis mutant allele of the Brachyury, or T, gene was created by insertion of an endogenous retrovirus-like early transposon (ETn) element into the exon 7 splice donor consensus sequence of the 8 exon T locus. While the developmental consequences of this disruption have been well characterized, the molecular consequences have not been previously investigated, and it has been assumed that the insertion results in a truncated protein. This study sought to further characterize the mutant TWis allele by investigating the nature of the transcripts produced by insertion of this transposable element.",

        "Abstract": "Spontanteous mutations in the T-box gene TBX3, result in the human ulnar-mammary syndrome, a dominant developmental disorder characterized by abnormal forelimb and apocrine gland development. In order to develop a mouse model to study the role of this gene during development and disease, we produced a mutation in the mouse ortholog, Tbx3. The phenotype of the mutant mice verifies the role of this gene in limb and mammary gland development, and, in addition, reveals a previously unknown role for the gene in the yolk sac, a fetal membrane that is the site of hematopoiesis and is essential for survival during gestation. In homozygous mutant embryos, the yolk sac undergoes cell death and degeneration at midgestation and the fetuses die over a range of several days; none survive to birth. Tbx3 is the first T-box gene implicated in yolk sac development. Homozygous embryos show a deficiency of mammary gland induction, and exhibit both forelimb and hindlimb abnormalities. Although heterozygous mice, unlike their heterozygous human counterparts, have no apparent phenotype in limb or mammary gland, the homozygous defects in the development of these organs represent more severe manifestations of the defects characteristic of the ulnar-mammary syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Synergism between the fields of reproduction and development has long been an important factor for advances in each field, and the development of gene modification technology in mammals has progressed hand in hand with advances in reproductive technology. The discovery and exploitation of embryonic stem cells for producing targeted gene mutations in the mouse, combined with advances in genome analysis, has provided a means of producing mouse models of human genetic diseases, including congenital defects. This review presents examples of how gene targeting and reproductive biology techniques are being applied to the production of mouse models for specific human developmental syndromes caused by mutations in genes of the T-box transcription factor gene family. The ulnar-mammary syndrome and the DiGeorge syndrome are two developmental syndromes that are currently being explored in this way.",

        "Abstract": "Rib-vertebrae (rv) is an autosomal recessive mutation in mouse that affects somite formation, morphology, and patterning. Expression of Notch pathway components is affected in the paraxial mesoderm of rv mutant embryos, and rv and a null allele of the Notch ligand delta1 show non-allelic non-complementation. By fine genetic mapping and complementation testing we have identified Tbx6, a gene essential for paraxial mesoderm formation, as the gene mutated in rv. Compound heterozygotes carrying a Tbx6 null allele and rv show a phenotype that is milder than in homozygous Tbx6 null but more severe than in homozygous rv mutants. Tbx6 expression is down-regulated in rv mutant embryos. An insertion in the promoter region upstream of the transcriptional start is present in the genome of rv mutants but not in different strains of mice wild type for Tbx6. Our results indicate that rv is a regulatory mutation of Tbx6 causing a hypomorphic phenotype.",

        "Abstract": "Neural crest cells are essential for proper development of a variety of tissues and structures, including peripheral and autonomic nervous systems, facial skeleton, aortic arches and pharyngeal glands like the thymus and parathyroids. Previous work has shown that bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling is required for the production of migratory neural crest cells that contribute to the neurogenic and skeletogenic lineages. We show here that BMP-dependent neural crest cells are also required for development of the embryonic aortic arches and pharynx-derived glands. Blocking formation or migration of this crest cell population from the caudal hindbrain resulted in strong phenotypes in the cardiac outflow tract and the thymus. Thymic aplasia or hypoplasia occurs despite uncompromised gene induction in the pharyngeal endoderm. In addition, when hypoplastic thymic tissue is found, it is ectopically located, but functional in thymopoiesis. Our data indicate that thymic phenotypes produced by neural crest deficits result from aberrant formation of pharyngeal pouches and impaired migration of thymic primordia because the mesenchymal content in the branchial arches is below a threshold level.",
