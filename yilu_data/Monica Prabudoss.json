        "Title": "Chronic anterior shoulder instability with bone loss: a practical approach.",
        "Abstract": "The stability of the glenohumeral joint, known for its remarkable mobility, relies on several factors, including the congruency of the joint's bones and the integrity of capsulolabral structures, encompassing the labrum, the capsule, and the glenohumeral ligaments. In cases of anterior shoulder instability, bone lesions are a common occurrence, most frequently involving glenoid bone loss and Hill-Sachs lesions. When both glenoid and humeral bone lesions coexist, the isolated Bankart procedure has exhibited a significant rate of failure. In such instances, the Latarjet procedure, especially when bone loss is present, retains its position as the gold standard, thanks to its consistent success in both short- and long-term outcomes. Recent advancements in research have explored alternative strategies to address bone loss, including the Remplissage procedure for humeral bone deficits and the use of bone block grafts to manage glenoid bone lesions, with a focus on achieving more anatomical techniques. However, it's crucial to recognize that, beyond bone loss, a multitude of intrinsic and extrinsic factors come into play when determining the most suitable treatment. The patient's profile, including factors like constitutional laxity and activity level, must be carefully considered in the decision-making process. The Latarjet procedure maintains its esteemed status as a benchmark in the field, thanks to its consistent excellence in both short- and long-term results. This article seeks to provide insights into the roles and placement of various surgical techniques within the context of chronic anterior shoulder instability, taking into account the intricate interplay of factors that influence treatment decisions.",

        "Abstract": "To address the increasing rates of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury among young sports participants, the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) and the Aspen Institute convened a meeting of a new national coalition to make ACL injury prevention a fundamental aspect of youth sports. This executive summary outlines the National ACL Injury Coalition's goals as defined at its inaugural meeting held at HSS on March 27, 2023. Using a theory of change called \"collective impact\" designed to support collaboration and drive systems-level change, the coalition focused on 4 strategic priorities intended to reduce ACL injury rates in high school sports participants: widespread implementation of interventions (ensuring that student athletes are adequately trained), high-quality education (raising awareness among many stakeholders), equitable access (ensuring that all high school sports participants, regardless of the resources available at their schools, have access to injury prevention resources), and aligning stakeholders (uniting disparate entities-schools, sports clubs, parents, coaches, and others in these efforts). The group outlined short-range, medium-range, and long-range goals over a 3-year period, including the launch of an ACL injury prevention toolkit for use by adolescent sports participants and teams, athletic trainers, coaches, and other key stakeholders.",

However, significant barriers can prevent access to home and community-based services (HCBS) among older adults and persons with dementia. Qualitative research on potential innovations and solutions in the contemporary context with attention to a wider range of state-level policy contexts is limited. Drawing on interviews with 49 key informants including state Medicaid officials, HCBS providers, and advocates for persons with dementia across 11 states, we examined perceived solutions to barriers. Key informants articulated a range of potential solutions and innovations, ranging from tangible or realized policy changes to 'magic wand' solutions. Policy research has typically focused on the former; excluding the latter may miss opportunities to envision and design a more effective long-term care system for persons living with dementia and older adults.",

        "Abstract": "Although recent theories of consciousness have emerged to define what consciousness is, an under-represented aspect within this field remains: time consciousness. However, the subjective passage of time is modulated by changing experiences within different situational contexts and by self-awareness. The experience of silence influences our awareness of self, space, and time, and it impacts on psychological well-being. The present review describes how self and time are influenced by different situations of silence (pure silence indoors and outdoors, the \"just thinking\" situation, and the combination of silence with deep relaxation). Also, the changes in time experience during a \"forced\" waiting situation due to the COVID-19 lockdown are presented in order to highlight the role of boredom in waiting situations and in situations in which we are alone with \"our thoughts.\" Finally, in the context of the importance of creating silence through meditation practices, the alterations to one's sense of self and time during mindfulness meditation are reviewed. These studies are discussed within the framework of the cognitive models of prospective time perception, such as the attentional-gate model and the model of self-regulation and self-awareness.",

        "Abstract": "Boron (B) is a crucial element for efficient plant growth and development; therefore, B-based fertilisers have been employed in agricultural applications. The need for B-based fertilisers for agricultural uses is continuously increasing as a result of the world's growing population. It is expected that the global market for B-based fertiliser will grow by around $6.3 billion by 2032; hence, demand for B sources will also increase. In addition to being used in fertiliser, B is also employed in the production of neodymium iron B (NdFeB) permanent magnets. The demand for NdFeB magnets is also continuously increasing. Hence, it is of the utmost importance to reclaim B from secondary resources due to the rising demand for B in a wide variety of applications. This review study addresses the recovery of B from various waste streams. The main focus is on the recovery of B from spent NdFeB magnets, borax sludge, and liquid streams such as brine water, seawater, sewage, industrial wastewater, and agricultural effluents. Different technologies for B recovery are discussed, such as sorption, solvent extraction, membrane processes, precipitation, and hydrometallurgical methods. Solvent extraction has been found to be a very effective approach for reclaiming B from spent NdFeB magnet waste and from liquid streams with high B concentration (>1-2\u00a0g/L). Further, the application of B-based fertiliser in agriculture application is reviewed. Challenges associated with B recovery from waste streams and future perspectives are also highlighted in this review.",

        "Title": "Multivariate Neural Patterns of Reward and Anxiety in Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa.",
        "Abstract": "People with anorexia nervosa (AN) commonly exhibit elevated anxiety and atypical reward responsiveness. To examine multivariate neural patterns associated with reward and the impact of anxiety on reward, we analyzed fMRI data from a monetary reward task using representational similarity analysis, a multivariate approach that measures trial-by-trial consistency of neural responses. Twenty-five adolescent girls with AN and 22 mildly anxious controls lacking any history of AN were presented personalized anxiety-provoking or neutral words before receiving a reward, and neural response patterns in reward regions were analyzed. Consistent with our preregistered hypothesis, AN participants showed lower representational similarity than controls during neutral-word rewarded trials. Within groups, controls showed significant representational similarity in reward circuit regions including the left nucleus accumbens, left basolateral amygdala, and left medial orbitofrontal cortex, which were not observed in AN. Further, reward-related prefrontal cognitive control areas - left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - showed significant representational similarity in both groups, but a larger spatial extent in controls. Contrary to predictions, there were no significant between-group differences for the effects of anxiety-words on reward representational similarity, and representational similarity did not predict longitudinal symptom change over six months. Overall, the results demonstrate relatively inconsistent trial-by-trial responses to reward receipt in the neutral state in AN compared with controls in both reward circuit and cognitive control regions, but no significant differential effects of anxiety states on reward responses. These results add to dynamic understandings of reward processing in AN that have potential implications for planning and guiding reward-focused interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Cervical cancer remains a significant but preventable threat to women's health throughout much of the developing world, including Uganda. Cervical cancer screening and timely treatment of pre-cancerous lesions is a cost-effective means of mitigating cervical cancer morbidity and mortality. However, only 5% of women in Uganda have ever been screened. Barriers to screening, such as social stigma and access to safe conditions, have been previously identified, but insights into the role of male spouses in encouraging or discouraging screening have been limited. To our knowledge, no studies have compared barriers and facilitators among women who had or had not yet been screened and male partners of screened and unscreened women.",

        "Abstract": "Drug repurposing in glomerular disease can deliver opportunities for steroid-free regimens, enable personalized multi-target options for resistant or relapsing disease and enhance treatment options for understudied populations (for example, children) and in resource-limited settings. Identification of drug-repurposing candidates can be data driven, which utilizes existing data on disease pathobiology, drug features and clinical outcomes, or experimental, which involves high-throughput drug screens. Information from databases of approved drugs, clinical trials and PubMed registries suggests that at least 96 drugs on the market cover 49 targets with immunosuppressive potential that could be candidates for drug repurposing in glomerular disease. Furthermore, evidence to support drug repurposing is available for 191 immune drug target-glomerular disease pairs. Non-immunological drug repurposing includes strategies to reduce haemodynamic overload, podocyte injury and kidney fibrosis. Recommended strategies to expand drug-repurposing capacity in glomerular disease include enriching drug databases with glomeruli-specific information, enhancing the accessibility of primary clinical trial data, biomarker discovery to improve participant selection into clinical trials and improve surrogate outcomes and initiatives to reduce patent, regulatory and organizational hurdles.",

        "Abstract": "Physical and chemical hydrogels are promising platforms for tissue engineering/regenerative medicine (TERM). In particular, physical hydrogels are suitable for use in the design of drug delivery systems owing to their reversibility and responsiveness to applied stimuli and external environment. Alternatively, the use of chemical hydrogels represents a better strategy to produce stable 3D constructs in the TERM field. In this work, these two strategies were combined to develop multi-functional formulations integrating both drug delivery potential and TERM approaches in a single device. Specifically, a novel photo-sensitive poly(ether urethane) (PEU) was developed to form supramolecular networks with \u03b1-cyclodextrins (\u03b1-CDs). The PEU was successfully synthesized using Poloxamer\u00ae 407, 1,6-diisocyanatohexane and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, as assessed by infrared spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (",

        "Abstract": "Perinatal depression has been shown to have deleterious effects on maternal post-partum functioning, as well as early child development. However, few studies have documented whether depression care helps to mitigate these effects. We examined the effects of the M-DEPTH (Maternal Depression Treatment in HIV) depression care model (including antidepressants and individual Problem Solving Therapy) on maternal functioning and infant development in the first 6 months post-delivery in an ongoing cluster randomized controlled trial of 391 HIV-infected women with at least mild depressive symptoms enrolled across eight antenatal care clinics in Uganda. A subsample of 354 (177 in each of the intervention and control groups) had a live birth delivery and comprised the analytic sample, of whom 69% had clinical depression at enrollment; 70% of women in the intervention group (including 96% of those with clinical depression) received depression treatment. Repeated-measures multivariable regression models found that the intervention group reported better infant care, lower parental burden, and greater perceived adequacy of parental support, compared to the control group. These findings suggest that depression care for pregnant women living with HIV is important not only for maternal mental health, but it also helps women to better manage parenting and care for their infant.",

However, the availability of dementia specialists is limited and varies across the United States. Using data from the Area Health Resources Files, we found that the median density of dementia specialists across hospital referral regions in United States is 28.8 per 100 000 population aged 65 years and older (interquartile range 19.3-43.6). We derived thresholds of 33-45 dementia specialists per 100 000 population aged 65 years and older as the provider density necessary to care for older adults with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Based on these thresholds, we estimated that 34%-59% of the population aged 65 years and older resided in areas with potential dementia specialist shortfalls. The extent of potential shortfalls varied by state and rurality. A better understanding of potential gaps in the availability of dementia specialists will inform policies and practices to ensure access to services for people with cognitive impairment and dementia.",

        "Abstract": "Multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism response teams (PERTs) have shown that timely triage expedites treatment. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) may help improve pulmonary embolism (PE) management with early CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) screening and accelerate PERT coordination. This study aimed to test the clinical validity of an FDA-approved PE AI algorithm. CTPA scan data of 200 patients referred due to automated AI detection of suspected PE were retrospectively reviewed. In our institution, all patients suspected of PE received a CTPA. The AI app was then used to analyze CTPA for the presence of PE and calculate the right-ventricle/left-ventricle (RV/LV) ratio. We compared the AI's output with the radiologists' report. Inclusion criteria included segmental PE with and without RV dysfunction and high-risk PE. The primary endpoint was false positive rate. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes according to the therapy selected, including catheter-directed interventions, systemic thrombolytics, and anticoagulation. Fifty-seven of 200 exams (28.5%) were correctly identified as positive for PE by the algorithm. A total of 143 exams (71.5%) were incorrectly reported as positive. In 8% of cases, PERT was consulted. Four patients (7%) received systemic thrombolytics without any complications. There were six patients (10.5%) who developed high-risk PE and underwent thrombectomy, one of whom died. Among 46 patients with acute PE without right heart strain, 44 (95%) survived. The false positive rate of our AI algorithm was 71.5%, higher than what was reported in the AI's prior clinical validity study (91% sensitivity, 100% specificity). A high rate of discordant AI auto-detection of suspected PE raises concerns about its diagnostic accuracy. This can lead to increased workloads for PERT consultants, alarm/notification fatigue, and automation bias. The AI direct notification process to the PERT team did not improve PERT triage efficacy.",

        "Title": "Liver biochemical indexes and cholesterol metabolism in cystic fibrosis patients with F508del/CFTR variant genotype after elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor treatment.",
        "Abstract": "Modulators of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) improved cystic fibrosis (CF) patients' outcome. The elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) combination was safe and effective improving lung function in patients with different CFTR genotypes, including at least one F508del mutation. However, cases with liver damage were reported. We describe 105 CF patients heterozygous for F508del in trans with another CFTR mutation, treated for 1\u00a0year with ETI. We analyzed liver biochemical parameters and cholesterol metabolism, including lathosterol and phytosterols, surrogate markers of cholesterol de-novo synthesis and absorption, respectively. The treatment significantly improved sweat chloride, body mass index and forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s, whereas it caused a significant increase of total and conjugated bilirubin, ALT and GGT, even if no patients developed CF liver disease. Such alterations were less relevant than those previously observed in ETI-treated F508del homozygous patients. Furthermore, ETI treatment significantly increased serum cholesterol by enhancing its absorption (correlation between serum cholesterol and phytosterols). Whereas, we observed a normalization of de-novo biosynthesis (lathosterol reduction) that was not observed in homozygous patients. These data suggest that the second mutation in trans with the F508del contributes to reduce the liver cholesterol accumulation and thus, the triggering of liver inflammation. However, no differences in the alteration of biochemical indexes were observed between CF patients with and without liver steatosis, and between patients with different mutations in trans with the F508del. Such data suggest to further investigate the effects of ETI therapy on liver function indexes and new predictive biomarkers.",

        "Abstract": "Patellar failure in total knee arthroplasty is a major source of complications postoperatively. Previous patellar failure reports commonly cited dissociations of modular and metal-backed patellar implants. However, mechanical breakage of monoblock all-polyethylene patellar implants is very rare. We present a case of an early shear failure of a 3-peg modified dome all-polyethylene patellar implant at 16 months. The patient underwent a revision procedure and at 1-year follow-up, the patient's patella and knee remained stable with no reported issues. Shear failure of polyethylene pegs requires excess cyclic shear stress imparted at the prosthetic-bone interface. Patellar implants with a cone design are more constrained and, if misaligned relative to the metallic trochlea, may impart excess shear force to the patella during flexion.",

        "Abstract": "In a recent call to action, we described pressing issues in the health-service-psychology (HSP) internship from the perspective of interns. In our article, we sought to initiate a dialogue that would include trainees and bring about concrete changes. The commentaries on our article are a testament to the readiness of the field to engage in such a dialogue, and we applaud the actionable recommendations that they make. In our response to these commentaries, we seek to move the conversation further forward. We observe two themes that cut across these responses: the impetus to gather novel data on training (the \"need to know\") and the importance of taking action (the \"need to act\"). We emphasize that in new efforts to gather data and take policy-level action, the inclusion of trainee stakeholders (as well as others involved in and affected by HSP training) is a crucial ingredient for sustainable and equitable change.",

        "Abstract": "Since its inception 30\u00a0years ago, Photovoice has gained increasing popularity as a research method and more recently has been incorporated within randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs. Photovoice is a participatory action research method that pairs photography with focus group discussions to record community strengths and concerns, build critical consciousness, and reach policymakers. Adherence of Photovoice implementation to these original tenets of Photovoice varies. This article provides the Photovoice protocol developed by the authors to improve the methodological rigor of Photovoice integration into RCTs and help contextualize the landscape for the HEALing Communities Study (HCS: NCT04111939), a greater than $350 million investment by the National Institute on Drug Abuse along with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to reduce opioid overdose deaths in 67 of the hardest-hit communities in four states (Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio). The product of a cross-state collaboration, this HCS Photovoice protocol provides ethical and methodological tools for incorporating Photovoice into RCT designs to enhance community engagement, communication campaigns, and data-driven decision-making about evidence-based practice selection and implementation.",

        "Title": "Conformational Alterations of the Cell Surface of Monomeric and Dimeric \u03b22m-Free HLA-I (Proto-HLA) May Enable Novel Immune Functions in Health and Disease.",
        "Abstract": "Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are polymorphic glycoproteins expressed on the cell surface of nucleated cells and consist of two classes, HLA class I and HLA class II. In contrast, in mice, these molecules, known as H-2, are expressed on both nucleated cells and erythrocytes. HLA-I molecules (Face-1) are heterodimers consisting of a polypeptide heavy chain (HC) and a light chain, B2-microglobulin (B2m). The heterodimers bind to antigenic peptides and present them to the T-cell receptors of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The HCs can also independently emerge on the cell surface as B2m-free HC monomers without peptides (Face-2). Early investigators suggested that the occurrence of B2m-free HCs on the cell surface resulted from the dissociation of B2m from Face-1. However, others documented the independent emergence of B2m-free HCs (Face-2) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface. The clustering of such HC molecules on either the cell surface or on exosomes resulted in the dimerization of B2m-free HCs to form homodimers (if the same allele, designated as Face-3) or heterodimers (if different alleles, designated as Face-4). Face-2 occurs at low levels on the cell surface of several normal cells but is upregulated on immune cells upon activation by proinflammatory cytokines and other agents such as anti-CD3 antibodies, phytohemagglutinin, and phorbol myristate acetate. Their density on the cell surface remains high as long as the cells remain activated. After activation-induced upregulation, Face-2 molecules undergo homo- and heterodimerization (Face-3 and Face-4). Observations made on the structural patterns of HCs and their dimerization in sharks, fishes, and tetrapod species suggest that the formation of B2m-free HC monomers and dimers is a recapitalization of a phylogenetically conserved event, befitting the term Proto-HLA for the B2m-free HCs. Spontaneous arthritis occurs in HLA-B27+ mice lacking B2m (HLA-B27+ B2m-/-) but not in HLA-B27+ B2m+/+ mice. Anti-HC-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) delay disease development. Some HLA-I polyreactive mAbs (MEM series) used for immunostaining confirm the existence of B2m-free variants in several cancer cells. The conformational alterations that occur in the B2m-free HCs enable them to interact with several inhibitory and activating receptors of cellular components of the innate (natural killer (NK) cells) and adaptive (T and B cells) immune systems. The NK cells express killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), whereas leukocytes (T and B lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells) express leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs). The KIRs and LILRs include activating and inhibitory members within their respective groups. This review focuses on the interaction of KIRs and LILRs with B2m-free HC monomers and dimers in patients with spondylarthritis. Several investigations reveal that the conformational alterations occurring in the alpha-1 and alpha-2 domains of B2m-free HCs may facilitate immunomodulation by their interaction with KIR and LILR receptors. This opens new avenues to immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases and even human cancers that express B2m-free HCs.",

        "Abstract": "Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after heart transplantation. CAV is often diagnosed in later stages or during routine screening in asymptomatic subjects. Myocardial work (MW), calculated using left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) and systemic blood pressure, may be associated with the presence of CAV and outperform conventional echocardiographic parameters. In this retrospective observational study, heart transplant recipients who underwent regular follow-up at our institution between May 2022 and September 2023 were enrolled. All included patients underwent speckle-tracking echocardiography, including MW indexes. CAV was classified according to invasive coronary angiography or computed tomography performed within 12 months of index echocardiography. We collected all available clinical and echocardiographic parameters and evaluated the potential association with CAV. CAV was detected in 29 of 93 patients (31%) (CAV+). Of the MW indexes, the mean global work efficiency (GWE) was 90 \u00b1 6% and was significantly lower in CAV+ than CAV- subjects (86 \u00b1 7% vs 91 \u00b1 4%, p <0.001). GWE (OR 0.86, CI 0.77 to 0.94, p\u202f=\u202f0.002), E/e' ratio (OR 1.27, CI 1.08 to 1.52, p\u202f=\u202f0.006), and left ventricular ejection fraction (OR 0.90; CI 0.81 to 0.98, p\u202f=\u202f0.017) were independently associated with the presence of CAV. GWE (GWE vs LV-GLS, delta area under the curve 0.154, p\u202f=\u202f0.047) and the proposed model (GWE+E/e' vs LV-GLS, delta area under the curve 0.198, p\u202f=\u202f0.004) were significantly superior in stratifying the incremental risk for CAV compared with LV-GLS. In conclusion, GWE was observed to be independently associated with the presence of CAV. MW could represent a novel noninvasive screening method for CAV in heart transplant recipients. Larger and prospective studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

        "Abstract": "Wet grasslands, which are vital for water and nutrient regulation, are characterised by distinct water, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics, and their interactions. Due to their shallow groundwater table, wet grasslands promote a strong interconnection between diverse vegetation and soil water. Researchers have investigated how wet grasslands respond to environmental changes, using various simulation models to understand how these sites contribute to water, C and N dynamics. However, a comprehensive, simultaneous study of all three of these dynamics is still lacking. This study makes use of a grassland lysimeter study with differently managed groundwater levels and employs the process-based MOdel for NItrogen and Carbon dynamics in Agroecosystems (MONICA) to simulate these dynamics. By using SPOTPY (Statistical Parameter Optimization Tool) to optimise the relevant parameters, we find that MONICA performs well in simulating vegetation growth (aboveground biomass), and elements of the water (evapotranspiration), C (gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration) and N (N in aboveground biomass, nitrate in soil solution, Nitrous oxide emissions) balance, with Willmott's Refined Index of Agreement always larger than 0.35. This level of accuracy demonstrates that MONICA is ready to be applied for scenario simulations of groundwater management and climate change to evaluate their impact on greenhouse gas emissions and long-term carbon storage, as well as water and nitrogen losses in wet grasslands.",

        "Title": "The swine waste resistome: Spreading and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in Escherichia coli strains and the associated microbial communities.",
        "Abstract": "The overuse of antimicrobials in livestock farming has led to the development of resistant bacteria and the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) among animals. When manure containing these antibiotics is applied to agricultural fields, it creates a selective pressure that promotes the acquisition of ARGs by bacteria, primarily through horizontal gene transfer. Most research on ARGs focuses on their role in clinical antibiotic resistance and their transfer from environmental sources to bacteria associated with humans, such as Escherichia coli. The study investigates the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) through class 1 integrons in 27 Escherichia coli strains from pig manure. It focuses on six common ARGs (ermB, cmlA, floR, qnrS, tetA, and TEM) and the class 1 integron gene, assessing their prevalence in manure samples from three pig farms. The study found correlations and anticorrelations among these genes, indicating a predisposition of the integron in spreading certain ARGs. Specifically, cmlA and tetA genes were positively correlated with each other and negatively with int1, suggesting they are not transferred via Int1. Farm B had the highest int1 counts and a higher abundance of the TEM gene, but lower levels of cmlA and tetA genes. The results underscore the complexity of predicting ARG spread in agricultural environments and the associated health risks to humans through the food chain. The study's results offer valuable insights into the antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) profile in swine livestock, potentially aiding in the development of methods to trace ARGs in the environment.",

        "Abstract": "Most patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have limited treatment options following standard-of-care therapy. VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated clinical activity in mCRC in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly in patients without liver metastases. The TKI zanzalintinib (XL092) targets VEGFR, MET and TAM kinases, proteins that are involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression. Zanzalintinib has immunomodulatory properties that may enhance response to ICIs. Presented is the design of STELLAR-303, a global, phase III, open-label, randomized study evaluating zanzalintinib plus atezolizumab versus regorafenib in patients with non-MSI-H mCRC who progressed during/after or are refractory/intolerant to standard-of-care therapy. The primary end point is overall survival in patients without liver metastases.",

The advent of lymphoscintigraphy with SLN biopsy (SLNB) has shown that melanoma can drain to multiple nodal basins but the significance of multiple basins (vs. one basin) with tumor-positive sentinel lymph node(s) (+SLN) of similar tumor burden has not been shown. We examined the impact of the number of nodal basins with +SLN (+basin) in melanoma patients and its significance for patients' prognosis and survival.",

        "Abstract": "There are great concerns for the accumulation in the environment of small dimension plastics, such as micro- and nanoplastics. Due to their small size, which facilitates their uptake by organisms, nanoplastics are of particular concern. The toxic effects of nanoplastics on plants are already reported in the literature, however nothing is known, to date, about the possible effects of climate change, in particular of increasing temperatures, on their toxicity for plants. To address this issue, plants of the water fern Azolla filiculoides were grown at optimal (25\u00a0\u00b0C) or high (35\u00a0\u00b0C) temperature, with or without polystyrene nanoplastics, and the effects of these stressors were assessed using a multidisciplinary approach. Green fluorescent polystyrene nanoplastics were used to track their possible uptake by A. filiculoides. The development and physiology of our model plant was adversely affected by both nanoplastics and high temperatures. Overall, histological, morphological, and photosynthetic parameters worsened under co-treatment, in accordance with the increased uptake of nanoplastics under higher temperature, as observed by fluorescence images. Based on our findings, the concern regarding the potential for increased toxicity of pollutants, specifically nanoplastics, at high temperatures is well-founded and warrants attention as a potential negative consequence of climate change. Additionally, there is cause for concern regarding the increase in nanoplastic uptake at high temperatures, particularly if this phenomenon extends to food and feed crops, which could lead to greater entry into the food chain.",

        "Title": "Applications of optical sensing and imaging spectroscopy in indoor farming: A systematic review.",
        "Abstract": "As demand for food continues to rise, innovative methods are needed to sustainably and efficiently meet the growing pressure on agriculture. Indoor farming and controlled environment agriculture have emerged as promising approaches to address this challenge. However, optimizing fertilizer usage, ensuring homogeneous production, and reducing agro-waste remain substantial challenges in these production systems. One potential solution is the use of optical sensing technology, which can provide real-time data to help growers make informed decisions and enhance their operations. optical sensing can be used to analyze plant tissues, evaluate crop quality and yield, measure nutrients, and assess plant responses to stress. This paper presents a systematic literature review of the current state of using spectral-optical sensors and hyperspectral imaging for indoor farming, following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The study surveyed existing studies from 2017 to 2023 to identify gaps in knowledge, provide researchers and farmers with current trends, and offer recommendations and inspirations for possible new research directions. The results of this review will contribute to the development of sustainable and efficient methods of food production.",

        "Abstract": "Mobile populations such as fisherfolk show high HIV incidence and prevalence. We pilot-tested implementation strategies to enhance pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence in the context of healthcare outreach events in two mainland fisherfolk communities on Lake Victoria, Uganda from September 2021 to February 2022. The implementation strategies included PrEP adherence supporters (selected from PrEP users' social networks), community workshops (to address misconceptions and stigma, and empower PrEP advocacy), and check-in calls (including refill reminders). PrEP medical records data were collected from 6-months pre-intervention to 6-months post-intervention. Qualitative interviews with 20 PrEP users (10 who continued, 10 who discontinued), 9 adherence supporters, and 7 key\u00a0partners (providers, community leaders) explored acceptability. Percentages of PrEP initiators (of those eligible) were significantly higher during the intervention (96.5%) than 6-months before the intervention (84.5%), p\u2009<\u20090.0001; percentages of PrEP users who persisted (i.e.,\u00a0possessed a refill) 6-months post-initiation (47.9% vs. 6.7%) and had at least 80% PrEP coverage (based on their\u00a0medication possession ratio) from the initiation date to 6-months later (35.9% vs. 0%) were higher during versus pre-intervention, p\u2009<\u20090.0001. A comparison fisherfolk community with better healthcare access had lower uptake (78.3%; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and persistence at 6-months (34.0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001), but higher coverage during the intervention period (70.4%; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Qualitative data suggested the strategies promoted PrEP use through reduced stigma and misconceptions. The intervention bundle cost was $223.95, $172.98, and $94.66 for each additional person for PrEP initiation, persistence, and coverage, respectively. Enhanced community-based PrEP implementation that fosters a supportive community environment can improve PrEP use in mobile populations without easy access to healthcare. (NCT05084716).",

        "Abstract": "Clinical guidelines direct healthcare professionals toward evidence-based practices. Evaluating guideline impact can elucidate information penetration, relevance, effectiveness, and alignment with evolving medical knowledge and technological advancements. As the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons Section on Tumors marks its 40th anniversary in 2024, this article reflects on the tumor guidelines established by the Section over the past decade and explores their impact on other publications, patents, and information dissemination. Six tumor guideline categories were reviewed: low-grade glioma, newly diagnosed glioblastoma, progressive glioblastoma, metastatic brain tumors, vestibular schwannoma, and pituitary adenomas. Citation data were collected from Google Scholar and PubMed. Further online statistics, such as social media reach, and features in policy, news, and patents were sourced from Altmetric. Online engagement was assessed through website and CNS+ mobile application visits. Data were normalized to time since publication. Metastatic Tumor guidelines (2019) had the highest PubMed citation rate at 26.1 per year and webpage visits (29\u2009100 page views 1/1/2019-9/30/2023). Notably, this guideline had two endorsement publications by partner societies, the Society of Neuro-Oncology and American Society of Clinical Oncology, concerning antiepileptic prophylaxis and steroid use, and the greatest reach on X (19.7 mentions/y). Citation rates on Google Scholar were led by Vestibular Schwannoma (2018). Non-Functioning Pituitary Adenoma led Mendeley reads. News, patent, or policy publications were led by low-grade glioma at 1.5/year. Our study shows that the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons Section on Tumors guidelines go beyond citations in peer-reviewed publications to include patents, online engagement, and information dissemination to the public.",

        "Abstract": "Jumping is an important task in skiing, snowboarding, ski jumping, figure skating, volleyball and many other sports. In these examples, jumping tasks are a performance criterion, and therefore detailed insight into them is important for athletes and coaches. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce a simple and easy-to-implement jump detection algorithm for skiing using acceleration data from inertial measurement units attached to ski boots. The algorithm uses the average of the absolute vertical accelerations of the two boots. We provide results for different parameter settings of the algorithm and two types of jumps: Big Air jumps and jumps during skiing. The latter are divided into small (time of flight < 500 ms) and medium (time of flight \u2265 500 ms) jumps. The algorithm detects 100% of Big Air, 94% of medium and 44% of small jumps. In addition, the settings with the highest detection rates also have the highest number of overdetected jumps. To resolve this conflict, a penalty-adjusted score that considers the number of overdetected jumps in the final performance analysis is proposed.",

Eventually, disturbances in the embryological/fetal development path facilitate the occurrence of scrotal hernia, a congenital malformation characterized by the presence of intestinal portions within the scrotal sac due to the abnormal expansion of the inguinal ring. In pigs, some genes have been related to this anomaly, but the genetic mechanisms involved remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression profile of a set of genes potentially involved with the manifestation of scrotal hernia in the inguinal ring tissue.",

        "Title": "Psychosocial issues and quality of life associated with food allergy.",
        "Abstract": "The day-to-day challenges involved in caring for a child with food allergies can be a significant stress within a family. As the child with a food allergy grows up, developmental changes as well as external influences such as bullying and peer pressure can further influence these stressors. When the child with a food allergy is young, the family may be limited on where they can vacation or go out to restaurants, which can cause tension and frustration within the family. Hypervigilance and fear of accidental exposure to the allergen takes an emotional and physical toll on the child with a food allergy and the child's family. Socially, children with a food allergy may have to limit participation in school events, parties, or camps. These limitations can cause feelings of isolation for the child and feelings of guilt for the parents. As the child becomes an adolescent and young adult (AYA), increased autonomy of dining options and a desire to fit in with peers can trigger higher risk-taking behavior, which can be a source of anxiety for the AYA as well as the caregivers. The aim of this review was to describe potential negative psychosocial impacts of having a food allergy for the family. Data were reviewed from a literature search of medical literature data bases between 2010 and 2020 by using the search terms \"food allergy,\" \"psychosocial,\" \"anxiety,\" and\" quality of life.\" As we better recognize the psychosocial issues associated with food allergies, we will have a better ability to develop effective interventions to improve the quality of life for these families.",

        "Abstract": "This study compared the effects of a low-fat vegan diet to those of a portion-controlled diet in people with type 1 diabetes. Over 12 weeks, the average total daily dose of insulin decreased significantly and insulin sensitivity increased significantly in the vegan group, while no significant changes were observed in the group receiving the portion-controlled diet. Total and LDL cholesterol decreased in the vegan group, as did the ratio of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine. A1C decreased in both groups. These findings suggest that a low-fat vegan diet may yield improvements in insulin sensitivity, insulin requirements, glycemic control, and markers of cardiovascular and renal health compared with a portion-controlled diet in people with type 1 diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUNDMetastases are the hallmark of lethal cancer, though underlying mechanisms that drive metastatic spread to specific organs remain poorly understood. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is known to have distinct sites of metastases, with lung, bone, liver, and lymph nodes being more common than brain, gastrointestinal tract, and endocrine glands. Previous studies have shown varying clinical behavior and prognosis associated with the site of metastatic spread; however, little is known about the molecular underpinnings that contribute to the differential outcomes observed by the site of metastasis.METHODSWe analyzed primary renal tumors and tumors derived from metastatic sites to comprehensively characterize genomic and transcriptomic features of tumor cells as well as to evaluate the tumor microenvironment at both sites.RESULTSWe included a total of 657 tumor samples (340 from the primary site [kidney] and 317 from various sites of metastasis). We show distinct genomic alterations, transcriptomic signatures, and immune and stromal tumor microenvironments across metastatic sites in a large cohort of patients with RCC.CONCLUSIONWe demonstrate significant heterogeneity among primary tumors and metastatic sites and elucidate the complex interplay between tumor cells and the extrinsic tumor microenvironment that is vital for developing effective anticancer therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, was approved for relapsed/refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) based on the results from pivotal Cohorts 1+2 of ZUMA-1 (NCT02348216). ZUMA-1 was expanded to investigate safety management strategies aimed at reducing the incidence and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events (NEs). Prospective safety expansion Cohort 5 evaluated the impact of debulking therapy, including rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy regimens and radiotherapy, in axi-cel-treated patients; the CRS and NE management strategy paralleled those in Cohorts 1+2. Among the 50 patients in Cohort 5 who received axi-cel, 40% received \u22653 prior lines of chemotherapy, and 40% had disease that progressed while on the most recent chemotherapy. Forty-eight patients (96%) received debulking therapy, 14 (28%) radiotherapy only, and 34 (71%) systemic immunochemotherapy. Median decrease in tumor burden (per sum of product of diameters of target lesions) relative to screening was 17.4% with R-ICE/R-GDP, 4.3% with other debulking chemotherapies, and 6.3% with radiotherapy only. All patients were followed for \u22658 months. CRS was reported in 43 patients (86%), with 1 patient (2%) experiencing grade \u22653. NEs were reported in 28 patients (56%), with 6 (12%) experiencing grade \u22653. Cytopenias were the most frequent grade \u22653 adverse event (AE); 19 (38%) and 18 (36%) treated patients had any and grade \u22653 prolonged thrombocytopenia, respectively, and 25 (50%) and 24 (48%) patients had any and grade \u22653 prolonged neutropenia, respectively. Overall, patients who received debulking chemotherapy had higher incidences of serious treatment-emergent AEs than those who received radiotherapy only. At the 24-month analysis, objective response rate was 72%, and complete response rate was 56%. Median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 25.8, 3.1, and 20.6 months, respectively. These results from exploratory Cohort 5 demonstrate the feasibility of debulking prior to axi-cel, and together with current real-world evidence, suggest that debulking regimens may help minimize the frequency and severity of CRS and NEs in patients with R/R LBCL. The incidence of other AEs observed in Cohort 5 suggest the risk/benefit profile was not improved via the debulking regimens studied here.",

        "Abstract": "Cell cycle progression is regulated by the orderly balance between kinase and phosphatase activities. PP2A phosphatase holoenzymes containing the B55 family of regulatory B subunits function as major CDK1-counteracting phosphatases during mitotic exit in mammals. However, the identification of the specific mitotic roles of these PP2A-B55 complexes has been hindered by the existence of multiple B55 isoforms. Here, through the generation of loss-of-function genetic mouse models for the two ubiquitous B55 isoforms (B55\u03b1 and B55\u03b4), we report that PP2A-B55\u03b1 and PP2A-B55\u03b4 complexes display overlapping roles in controlling the dynamics of proper chromosome individualization and clustering during mitosis. In the absence of PP2A-B55 activity, mitotic cells display increased chromosome individualization in the presence of enhanced phosphorylation and perichromosomal loading of Ki-67. These data provide experimental evidence for a regulatory mechanism by which the balance between kinase and PP2A-B55 phosphatase activity controls the Ki-67-mediated spatial organization of the mass of chromosomes during mitosis.",

        "Abstract": "Accumulation of the pro-inflammatory protein S100A9 has been implicated in neuroinflammatory cascades in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). S100A9 co-aggregates with other proteins such as \u03b1-synuclein in PD and A\u03b2 in AD, contributing to amyloid plaque formation and neurotoxicity. The amyloidogenic nature of this protein and its role in chronic neuroinflammation suggest that it may play a key role in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Research into molecules targeting S100A9 could be a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent its amyloidogenic self-assembly and to attenuate the neuroinflammatory response in affected brain tissue. This work suggests that bioactive natural molecules, such as those found in the Mediterranean diet, may have the potential to alleviate neuroinflammation associated with the accumulation of proteins such as S100A9 in neurodegenerative diseases. A major component of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), hydroxytyrosol (HT), with its ability to interact with and modulate S100A9 amyloid self-assembly and expression, offers a compelling approach for the development of novel and effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of ND. The findings highlight the importance of exploring natural compounds, such as HT, as potential therapeutic options for these complex and challenging neurological conditions.",

        "Abstract": "This article focuses on the emergence of cooperation in societies of self-interested agents. In particular, it introduces a mechanism based on indirect-stigmergic-interactions between agents moving in an environment, to express the likeliness of finding cooperative partners. On the one hand, agents that find themselves cooperating with others emit pheromones in their current location, expressing the presence of agents willing to cooperate. On the other hand, agents that sense pheromones tend to move towards regions with a higher pheromone concentration. Results show that this mechanism leads to the emergence of spatial regions where cooperation can be effectively sustained, and in which agents can overall get better payoffs than those agents not taking into account pheromones in their choices.",

        "Title": "Drug delivery in leptomeningeal disease: Navigating barriers and beyond.",
        "Abstract": "Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) refers to the infiltration of cancer cells into the leptomeningeal compartment. Leptomeninges are the two membranous layers, called the arachnoid membrane and pia mater. The diffuse nature of LMD poses a challenge to its effective diagnosis and successful management. Furthermore, the predominant phenotype; solid masses or freely floating cells, has altering implications on the effectiveness of drug delivery systems. The standard of care is the intrathecal delivery of chemotherapy drugs but it is associated with increased instances of treatment-related complications, low patient compliance, and suboptimal drug distribution. An alternative involves administering the drugs systemically, after which they must traverse fluid barriers to arrive at their destination within the leptomeningeal space. However, this route is known to cause off-target effects as well as produce subtherapeutic drug concentrations at the target site within the central nervous system. The development of new drug delivery systems such as liposomal cytarabine has improved drug delivery in leptomeningeal metastatic disease, but much still needs to be done to effectively target this challenging condition. In this review, we discuss about the anatomy of leptomeninges relevant for drug penetration, the conventional and advanced drug delivery methods for LMD. We also discuss the future directions being set by different clinical trials.",

NCCN recommends keeping the time from surgery to the start of RT (TSRT) within 6 weeks to avoid possibly compromising patient outcomes. HPV+ OPSCCs behave more favorably than HPV- OPSCCs. We hypothesized that TSRT beyond 6 weeks may not portend poorer outcomes for the former.",

        "Abstract": "Pharmacogenetics investigates sequence of genes that affect drug response, enabling personalized medication. This approach reduces drug-induced adverse reactions and improves clinical effectiveness, making it a crucial consideration for personalized medical care. Numerous guidelines, drawn by global consortia and scientific organizations, codify genotype-driven administration for over 120 active substances. As the scientific community acknowledges the benefits of genotype-tailored therapy over traditionally agnostic drug administration, the push for its implementation into Italian healthcare system is gaining momentum. This evolution is influenced by several factors, including the improved access to patient genotypes, the sequencing costs decrease, the growing of large-scale genetic studies, the rising popularity of direct-to-consumer pharmacogenetic tests, and the continuous improvement of pharmacogenetic guidelines. Since EMA (European Medicines Agency) and AIFA (Italian Medicines Agency) provide genotype information on drug leaflet without clear and explicit clinical indications for gene testing, the regulation of pharmacogenetic testing is a pressing matter in Italy. In this manuscript, we have reviewed how to overcome the obstacles in implementing pharmacogenetic testing in the clinical practice of the Italian healthcare system. Our particular emphasis has been on germline testing, given the absence of well-defined national directives in contrast to somatic pharmacogenetics.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity/overweight and its complications are a growing problem in many countries. Italian Society of Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery for Obesity (Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Chirurgia dell'Obesit\u00e0 e delle Malattie Metaboliche-SICOB) decided to develop the first Italian guidelines for the endoscopic bariatric treatment of obesity. The creation of SICOB Guidelines is based on an extended work made by a panel of 44 members and a coordinator. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology has been used to decide the aims, reference population, and target health professionals. Clinical questions have been created using the PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) conceptual framework. We will perform systematic reviews, formal meta-analyses, and network meta-analyses for each PICO and critical outcomes aimed at assessing and rating the efficacy and safety of endoscopic bariatric procedures in comparison with either no interventions, lifestyle interventions, or approved anti-obesity treatments in trials with a follow-up of at least 52 weeks. For PICO on temporary endoscopic bariatric treatments, we will also consider RCT with a minimum duration of 6 months. The panel proposed 8 questions, organized into four domains: A. Indication for endoscopic bariatric surgery; B. Revisional surgery; C. Temporary gastric and duodenal-jejunal procedures; D. Endoscopic diagnosis/treatment of bariatric and metabolic surgery complications. These guidelines will apply to patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200914 years) with body mass index (BMI)\u2009\u2265\u200927 kg/m",

        "Abstract": "Recently-updated global guidelines for cervical cancer screening incorporated new technologies-most significantly, the inclusion of HPV DNA detection as a primary screening test-but leave many implementation decisions at countries' discretion. We sought to develop recommendations for Malawi as a test case since it has the second-highest cervical cancer burden globally and high HIV prevalence. We incorporated updated epidemiologic data, the full range of ablation methods recommended, and a more nuanced representation of how HIV status intersects with cervical cancer risk and exposure to screening to model outcomes of different approaches to screening.",

        "Abstract": "Skeletal muscle, the major processor of dietary glucose, stores it in myriad glycogen granules. Their numbers vary with cellular location and physiological and pathophysiological states. AI models were developed to derive granular glycogen content from electron-microscopic images of human muscle. Two UNet-type semantic segmentation models were built: \"Locations\" classified pixels as belonging to different regions in the cell; \"Granules\" identified pixels within granules. From their joint output, a pixel fraction pf was calculated for images from patients positive (MHS) or negative (MHN) to a test for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. pf was used to derive vf, the volume fraction occupied by granules. The relationship vf (pf) was derived from a simulation of volumes (\"baskets\") containing virtual granules at realistic concentrations. The simulated granules had diameters matching the real ones, which were measured by adapting a utility devised for calcium sparks. Applying this relationship to the pf measured in images, vf was calculated for every region and patient, and from them a glycogen concentration. The intermyofibrillar spaces and the sarcomeric I band had the highest granular content. The measured glycogen concentration was low enough to allow for a substantial presence of non-granular glycogen. The MHS samples had an approximately threefold lower concentration (significant in a hierarchical test), consistent with earlier evidence of diminished glucose processing in MHS. The AI models and the approach to infer three-dimensional magnitudes from two-dimensional images should be adaptable to other tasks on a variety of images from patients and animal models and different disease conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Beyond Bias was an intervention introduced in Burkina Faso, Pakistan and Tanzania, with the aim of reducing health worker bias toward young, unmarried and nulliparous women seeking family planning services. This study used qualitative methods - based on interviews with health workers who participated in the intervention, managers at health facilities that participated in the intervention, and policy and program stakeholders at the national level - to understand implementation experiences with the intervention. The results offer insights for organizations or countries seeking to implement Beyond Bias or similar programs, and point to some other key implementation challenges for multi-component interventions in lower-resource settings. The intervention, developed using a human-centered design approach, was seen as key for successful implementation but there were logistical challenges. The digital intervention was disruptive and distracting to many. In addition, the non-financial rewards intervention was perceived as complex, and some participants expressed feeling discouraged when they did not receive a reward. Beyond Bias did not sufficiently attend to the \"outer setting,\" and this was perceived as a major implementation barrier as it limited individuals' capacity to fully achieve the desired behavior change; for example, space constraints meant that some health facilities could not ensure private services for all clients. There were scalability concerns related to cost, and there is uncertainty whether diversity of contexts (within and across countries) might constrain implementation of Beyond Bias at scale.",

        "Abstract": "The Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality Healthcare Innovations Exchange (IE) was developed to collect and report on innovative approaches to improving health care. The team reviewed 348 IE innovations including patient-reported satisfaction or experience measures. Innovations most often measured overall rating of care (61% of innovations), followed by access (52%) and provider-patient communication (12%). More than half used patient satisfaction surveys (n = 187) rather than patient experience surveys (n = 64). Innovations using patient experience surveys more often measured specific aspects of patient care, for example, access, versus a general overall rating of care. Most innovations using patient experience surveys administered nonvalidated, homegrown surveys, with few using the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality-endorsed, psychometrically-tested CAHPS (Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) survey. The most common study design was postimplementation-only (65%), highlighting that methodological rigor used to assess patient-centeredness in the IE is low. Broad use of patient experience surveys and more rigorous evaluation study designs has increased some over time but is still lacking.",

        "Abstract": "To quantify the clinical unmet need of r/r MCL patients who progress on a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), we conducted a systematic review to identify studies that reported overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), or response outcomes of patients who received a chemo(immunotherapy)\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0targeted agent standard therapy (STx) or brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel) in the post-BTKi setting. Twenty-six studies (23 observational; three trials) reporting outcomes from 2005 to 2022 were included. Using two-stage frequentist meta-analyses, the estimated median PFS/OS for patients treated with an STx was 7.6\u00a0months (95% CI: 3.9-14.6) and 9.1\u00a0months (95% CI: 7.3-11.3), respectively. The estimated objective response rate (ORR) was 45% (95% CI: 34-57%). For patients treated with brexu-cel, the estimated median PFS/OS was 14.9\u00a0months (95% CI: 10.5-21.0) and 32.1\u00a0months (95% CI: 25.2-41.2), with a pooled ORR of 89% (95% CI: 86-91%). Our findings highlight a significant unmet need for patients whose disease progresses on a covalent BTKi.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown that antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDI) can be strongly potentiated by the addition of the non-toxic inorganic salt, potassium iodide (KI). This approach was shown to apply to many different photosensitizers, including the xanthene dye Rose Bengal (RB) excited by green light (540\u00a0nm). Rose Bengal diacetate (RBDA) is a lipophilic RB derivative that is easily taken up by cells and hydrolyzed to produce an active photosensitizer. Because KI is not taken up by microbial cells, it was of interest to see if aPDI mediated by RBDA could also be potentiated by KI. The addition of 100 mM KI strongly potentiated the killing of Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylocccus aureus, Gram-negative Eschericia coli, and fungal yeast Candida albicans when treated with RBDA (up to 15 \u00b5M) for 2 hours followed by green light (540\u00a0nm, 10\u00a0J/cm",

        "Abstract": "Dengel, DR, Studee, HR, Juckett, WT, Bosch, TA, Carbuhn, AF, Stanforth, PR, and Evanoff, NG. Muscle-to-bone ratio in NCAA division I collegiate football players by position. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2024-The purpose of this study was to compare the muscle-to-bone ratio (MBR) in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I football players (collegiate football players [CFP]) to healthy, age-matched controls. In addition, we examined MBR in CFP by position. A total of 553 CFP and 261 controls had their total and regional lean mass (LM), fat mass (FM), and bone mineral content (BMC) determined by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). College football players were categorized by positions defined as offensive linemen (OL), defensive linemen (DL), tight end, linebacker (LB), running back (RB), punter or kicker, quarterback (QB), defensive back (DB), and wide receiver (WR). There were significant differences between CFP and controls for total LM (80.1 \u00b1 10.0 vs. 56.9 \u00b1 7.8 kg), FM (22.2 \u00b1 12.5 vs. 15.2 \u00b1 7.1 kg), and BMC (4.3 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 3.1 \u00b1 0.5 kg). Although there were significant differences in body composition between CFP and controls, there was no significant differences in total MBR between CFP and controls (18.6 \u00b1 1.4 vs. 18.8 \u00b1 1.7). Regionally, CFP had significantly lower trunk MBR than controls (26.7 \u00b1 2.7 vs. 28.7 \u00b1 4.2), but no difference was seen in leg or arm MBR. Positional differences in CFP were noted as total MBR being significantly higher in DL (19.0 \u00b1 1.4) than in DB (18.1 \u00b1 1.3), WR (18.1 \u00b1 1.3), and LB (18.2 \u00b1 1.3). OL had a significantly higher total MBR (19.2 \u00b1 1.3) than DB (18.1 \u00b1 1.3), LB (18.2 \u00b1 1.3), QB (18.1 \u00b1 1.0), and WR (18.1 \u00b1 1.3). In addition, RB had significantly higher total MBR (18.8 \u00b1 1.3) than DB (18.1 \u00b1 1.3) and WR (18.1 \u00b1 1.3). This study may provide athletes and training staff with normative values when evaluating total and regional MBR with DXA.",

        "Abstract": "Acne vulgaris is a common, often chronic inflammatory disease that can affect all ages and skin tones. Beyond acute lesions, the sequelae of acne - specifically scarring and dyspigmentation - can be long-lasting, challenging to treat and have substantial psychosocial impact on affected individuals. For acne scarring, treatment modalities include topical, physical, and laser and light therapies, with combination approaches typically yielding optimal outcomes. Trifarotene is a novel fourth generation retinoid with targeted action towards retinoid acid receptor gamma (RAR-\u03b3), the most common isotype found in the epidermis, that has previously been approved for the management of moderate-to-severe facial and truncal acne in individuals over the age of 12 years. Recently, data on trifarotene supports its application in acne scarring. Herein, we provide a succinct review on various treatments for acne scarring and explore how trifarotene and its mechanism of action present an additional topical approach to target atrophic acne scarring.",

        "Abstract": "Thousands of prolonged sequences of human ultra-conserved non-coding elements (UCNEs) share only one common feature: peculiarities in the unique composition of their dinucleotides. Here we investigate whether the numerous weak signals emanating from these dinucleotide arrangements can be used for computational identification of UCNEs within the human genome. For this purpose, we analyzed 4272 UCNE sequences, encompassing 1\u2009393\u2009448 nucleotides, alongside equally sized control samples of randomly selected human genomic sequences. Our research identified nine different features of dinucleotide arrangements that enable differentiation of UCNEs from the rest of the genome. We employed these nine features, implementing three Machine Learning techniques - Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks - to classify UCNEs, achieving an accuracy rate of 82-84%, with specific conditions allowing for over 90% accuracy. Notably, the strongest feature for UCNE identification was the frequency ratio between GpC dinucleotides and the sum of GpG and CpC dinucleotides. Additionally, we investigated the entire pool of 31\u2009046 SNPs located within UCNEs for their representation in the ClinVar database, which catalogs human SNPs with known phenotypic effects. The presence of UCNE-associated SNPs in ClinVar aligns with the expectation of a random distribution, emphasizing the enigmatic nature of UCNE phenotypic manifestation.",

However, gaps remain about how to best sustain EBPs in treatment organizations in the U.S., especially in resource-constrained settings like publicly-funded youth substance use services. One important, but understudied, determinant of EBP sustainment is alignment: the extent to which multi-level factors that influence sustainment processes and outcomes are congruent, consistent, and/or coordinated. This study examined the role of alignment in U.S. states' efforts to sustain the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA), an EBP for youth substance use disorders, during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "Abstract": "Global methylation analysis of gene promoters is promising for detection of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse (HSIL+) in high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)-positive women. However, diagnostic performance of methylation data at individual CpG-sites is limited. We explored methylation for predicting HSIL+ in self- and clinician-collected samples from Papua New Guinea. Methylation of EPB41L3 (1-6 CpG-sites), hTERT (1-10 CpG-sites) and FAM19A4 (1-5 CpG-sites) was assessed through pyrosequencing from 44 HPV+\u00a0samples (4 cancers, 19 HSIL, 4 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 17 normal). New primers were designed for FAM19A4 directed to the first exon region not explored previously. In clinician-collected samples, methylation at CpG-sites 4 and 5 of EPB41L3 were the best HSIL predictors (AUC >0.83) and CpG-site 4 for cancer (0.925). Combination of EPB41L3 sites 2/4 plus FAM19A4 site 1 were the best HSIL+\u00a0markers [100% sensitivity, 63.2% specificity]. Methylation at CpG-site 5 of FAM19A4 was the best HSIL predictor (0.67) in self-collected samples, and CpG-sites 1 and 3 of FAM19A4 for cancer (0.77). Combined, FAM19A4 site 1 plus HPV 16/18 detection yielded sensitivity of 82.6% and specificity of 61.9%. In conclusion, methylation at individual CpG-sites of EPB41L3 and FAM19A4 outperformed global analysis and improved HSIL+\u00a0detection, warranting further investigation.",

We conducted a systematic review without restriction to journal type, journal impact factor, disease state or intervention to evaluate the quality of NI trials, including a comprehensive risk of bias assessment and comparison of quality over time.",

Genistein is a natural isoflavonoid with known chemotherapeutic activity. Unfortunately, it has low bioavailability due to its poor aqueous solubility and excessive metabolism. In the current study, genistein was incorporated into transferosomal hydrogel to improve its bioavailability.

Botanical extracts, rich in phytoconstituents, present a useful resource for discovering therapies that could target senescence and thus improve healthspan. Here, we show that daily oral administration of a standardized extract of Salvia haenkei (Haenkenium (HK)) extended lifespan and healthspan of naturally aged mice. HK treatment inhibited age-induced inflammation, fibrosis and senescence markers across several tissues, as well as increased muscle strength and fur thickness compared with age-matched controls. We also found that HK treatment reduced acutely induced senescence by the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, using p16",

        "Abstract": "Intrinsic breast cancer molecular subtyping (IBCMS) provides significant prognostic information for patients with breast cancer and helps determine treatment. This study compared IBCMS methods on various gene-expression platforms in PALOMA-2 and PALLET trials. PALOMA-2 tumor samples were profiled using EdgeSeq and nanostring and subtyped with AIMS, PAM50, and research-use-only (ruo)Prosigna. PALLET tumor biopsies were profiled using mRNA sequencing and subtyped with AIMS and PAM50. In PALOMA-2 (n\u2009=\u2009222), a 54% agreement was observed between results from AIMS and gold-standard ruoProsigna, with AIMS assigning 67% basal-like to HER2-enriched. In PALLET (n\u2009=\u2009224), a 69% agreement was observed between results from PAM50 and AIMS. Different IBCMS methods may lead to different results and could misguide treatment selection; hence, a standardized clinical PAM50 assay and computational approach should be used.Trial number: NCT01740427.",

Moreover, current evidence supports they can also be useful to evaluate the prognosis of patients with chronic liver disease.",

        "Abstract": "The issue of obstetric violence is internationally acknowledged as a serious violation of human rights. First identified by the Committee of Experts of the Inter-American Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1 Convention in 2012, it is recognized as a form of gender-based violence that infringes upon women's rights during childbirth. Nations such as Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, and certain regions in Spain have implemented laws against it, highlighting its severity and the need for protective legislation. Major international organizations, including WHO and the Council of Europe, advocate for the elimination of disrespectful and abusive treatment in maternity care. In 2019, the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women called on states to protect women's human rights in reproductive services by enforcing laws, prosecuting perpetrators, and providing compensation to victims. However, despite advances, there remains institutional and systemic resistance to recognizing obstetric violence, which undermines trust in healthcare and impacts women's quality of life. Addressing this violence is imperative, requiring education and training in women's human rights for all healthcare professionals. As part of the coalition of experts from various organizations (InterOVO), we respond to the publication by EAPM, EBCOG, and EMA: \"Joint Position Statement: Substandard and Disrespectful Care in Labor - Because Words Matter.\" We are committed to preventing and mitigating obstetric violence and improving care for women and newborns.",

        "Abstract": "The approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), introducing several ICI-based combinations as the new standard of care for affected patients. Nonetheless, monotherapy with antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as pazopanib or sunitinib, still represents a first-line treatment option for selected patients belonging to the favorable risk group according to the International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC) model. After TKI monotherapy, the main second-line option is represented by ICI monotherapy with the anti-Programmed Death Receptor 1(PD-1) nivolumab. To date, the expected clinical outcomes are similar with pazopanib or sunitinib and there is no clear indication for selecting one TKI over the other. Moreover, their impact on subsequent ICI treatment outcomes is not well defined, yet. Based on these premises, we investigated the immunomodulatory activity of these drugs in vitro and in vivo.Both TKIs induced Programmed Cell Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and soluble PD-L1 release in RCC cells, and hampered T cell activation, reducing cytokine production and the proportion of activated T cells. Nevertheless, in a syngeneic co-culture system with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tumor cells, incubation with anti-PD-1 antibody following TKIs treatment significantly restored T cell function, potentiating the cytotoxic effects against tumor cells. Pazopanib and sunitinib followed by anti-PD-1 antibody produced a comparable inhibition of tumor growth in a RCC syngeneic mouse model. Our findings suggest that pazopanib and sunitinib, showing similar immunomodulatory effects, may have a comparable impact on the subsequent effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the potential advantage of all-polyethylene tibial components, modular metal-backed component use predominates the market in the United States for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This is partially driven by concerns about the associated revision risk due to the lack of modularity with all-polyethylene components. This study utilized the American Joint Replacement Registry to compare the associated risk of all-cause revision and revision for infection for all-polyethylene versus modular metal-backed tibial components.",

        "Abstract": "In the context of deep learning models, attention has recently been paid to studying the surface of the loss function in order to better understand training with methods based on gradient descent. This search for an appropriate description, both analytical and topological, has led to numerous efforts in identifying spurious minima and characterize gradient dynamics. Our work aims to contribute to this field by providing a topological measure for evaluating loss complexity in the case of multilayer neural networks. We compare deep and shallow architectures with common sigmoidal activation functions by deriving upper and lower bounds for the complexity of their respective loss functions and revealing how that complexity is influenced by the number of hidden units, training models, and the activation function used. Additionally, we found that certain variations in the loss function or model architecture, such as adding an \u2113",

        "Abstract": "The use of suitable analytical techniques for the detection of adulteration, falsification, deliberate substitution, and mislabeling of foods has great importance in the industrial, scientific, legislative, and public health contexts. This way, this work reports an integrative review with a current analytical approach for food authentication, indicating the main analytical techniques to identify adulteration and perform the traceability of chemical components in processed and non-processed foods, evaluating the authenticity and geographic origin. This work presents results from a systematic search in Science Direct\u00ae and Scopus\u00ae databases using the keywords \"authentication\" AND \"food\", \"authentication,\" AND \"beverage\", from published papers from 2013 to, 2024. All research and reviews published were employed in the bibliometric analysis, evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of analytical techniques, indicating the perspectives for direct, quick, and simple analysis, guaranteeing the application of quality standards, and ensuring food safety for consumers. Furthermore, this work reports the analysis of natural foods to evaluate the origin (traceability), and industrialized foods to detect adulterations and fraud. A focus on research to detect adulteration in milk and dairy products is presented due to the importance of these products in the nutrition of the world population. All analytical tools discussed have advantages and drawbacks, including sample preparation steps, the need for reference materials, and mathematical treatments. So, the main advances in modern analytical techniques for the identification and quantification of food adulterations, mainly milk and dairy products, were discussed, indicating trends and perspectives on food authentication.",

        "Abstract": "Aurones, particular polyphenolic compounds belonging to the class of minor flavonoids and overlooked for a long time, have gained significative attention in medicinal chemistry in recent years. Indeed, considering their unique and outstanding biological properties, they stand out as an intriguing reservoir of new potential lead compounds in the drug discovery context. Nevertheless, several physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic (P3) issues hinder their progression in more advanced phases of the drug discovery pipeline, making lead optimization campaigns necessary. In this context, scaffold hopping has proven to be a valuable approach in the optimization of natural products. This review provides a comprehensive and updated picture of the scaffold-hopping approaches directed at the optimization of natural and synthetic aurones. In the literature analysis, a particular focus is given to nitrogen and sulfur analogues. For each class presented, general synthetic procedures are summarized, highlighting the key advantages and potential issues. Furthermore, the biological activities of the most representative scaffold-hopped compounds are presented, emphasizing the improvements achieved and the potential for further optimization compared to the aurone class.",

        "Abstract": "Current United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations include routine screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer; however, two out of every three cancer cases occur in other indications, leading to diagnoses in advanced stages of the disease and a higher likelihood of mortality. Blood-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests can impact cancer screening and early detection by monitoring for multiple different cancer types at once, including indications where screening is not performed routinely today. We conducted a survey amongst healthcare providers (HCPs), payers, and patients within the U.S. health system to understand the current utilization of cancer screening tests and the anticipated barriers to widespread adoption of blood-based MCED tests. The results indicated that the community favors the adoption of blood-based MCED tests and that there is broad agreement on the value proposition. Despite this recognition, the survey highlighted that there is limited use today due to the perceived lack of clinical accuracy and utility data, high out-of-pocket patient costs, and lack of payer coverage. To overcome the hurdles for future widespread adoption of blood-based MCED tests, increased investment in data generation, education, and implementation of logistical support for HCPs will be critical.",

The goal was to develop a strategic approach to prevent recurrence of osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma metabolism and the genomic instability of osteosarcoma, immunotherapy for osteosarcoma, CAR-T cell therapy, DeltaRex-G tumor-targeted gene therapy, repurposed drugs, alternative medicines, and personalized medicine were discussed. Only DeltaRex-G was voted on. The conclusions were the following: No intervention has been demonstrated to improve survival in a clinical trial. Additionally, the consensus (10/12 in favor) was that DeltaRex-G without immunotherapy may be administered for up to one year. Phase 2/3 randomized studies of DeltaRex-G should be performed to determine whether the incidence of recurrence could be reduced in high-risk individuals. Furthermore, a personalized approach using drugs with minimal toxicity could be attempted with the acknowledgement that there are no efficacy data to base this on. Repurposed drugs and alternative therapies should be tested in mouse models of osteosarcoma. Moreover, unmodified IL-2 primed Gamma Delta (NK) cell therapy may be used to prevent recurrence. Lastly, rapid development of CAR-T cell therapy is recommended, and an institute dedicated to the study of osteosarcoma is needed.",

To explore the service needs of this population, we interviewed providers (n = 11) and clients (n = 10) from eight supportive housing organizations working with SGM populations in Los Angeles County, USA. We used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to synthesize interview responses into themes (by domain and cross-cutting). Take-aways included the need for investment in systems of care for vulnerable SGM populations; the particular marginalization of Trans individuals and providers that serve them; the roles of supportive housing staff, residents, and leadership in cultivating an affirming environment; prevalence of discrimination and stigma within supportive housing programs and broader society; and the complex interrelationships among SGM identity, homelessness, and criminal justice system involvement. These findings have important implications for supportive housing services and related policy.",

While there are potential benefits from tighter alignment between providers and payers, risks of perverse impacts on health care markets loom large. Yet, little is known about this new wave of consolidation, which limits options for policy or regulatory responses. We focus on a dominant insurer's acquisitions of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) to document the growth and geographic spread of these ownership events. We found that a diverse swathe of the United States has experienced an insurer-led ASC takeover. The acquisitions are also more frequently in areas where the insurer holds a higher enrollee market share at baseline, although a linear prediction of the likelihood of ASC acquisition shows a more nuanced picture.",

        "Title": "A randomized trial of collaborative support for opioid taper after trauma hospitalization.",
        "Abstract": "The COTAT (Collaborative Opioid Taper After Trauma) Study was a randomized trial of an opioid taper support program using a physician assistant (PA) to provide pain and opioid treatment guidance to primary care providers assuming care for adult patients with moderate to severe trauma discharged from a Level I trauma center on opioid therapy. Patients were recruited, assessed, and randomized individually by a surgery research recruitment team one to two days prior to discharge to home. Participants randomized to the opioid taper support program were contacted by phone within a few days of discharge by the PA interventionist to confirm enrollment and their primary care provider (PCP). The intervention consisted of PA support as needed to the PCP concerning pain and opioid care at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 after discharge or until the PCP office indicated they no longer needed support or the patient had tapered off opioids. The PA was supervised by a pain physician-psychiatrist, a family physician, and a trauma surgeon. Patients randomized to usual care received standard hospital discharge instructions and written information on managing opioid medications after discharge. Trial results were analyzed using repeated measures analysis. 37 participants were randomized to the intervention and 36 were randomized to usual care. The primary outcomes of the trial were pain, enjoyment, general activity (PEG score) and mean daily opioid dose at 3 and 6 months after hospital discharge. Treatment was unblinded but assessment was blinded. No significant differences in PEG or opioid outcomes were noted at either time point. Physical function at 3 and 6 months and pain interference at 6 months were significantly better in the usual care group. No significant harms of the intervention were noted. COVID-19 (corona virus 2019) limited recruitment of high-risk opioid tolerant subjects, and limited contact between the PA interventionist and the participants and the PCPs. Our opioid taper support program failed to improve opioid and pain outcomes, since both control and intervention groups tapered opioids and improved PEG scores after discharge. Future trials of post-trauma opioid taper support with populations at higher risk of persistent opioid use are needed. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov under NCT04275258 19/02/2020. This trial was funded by a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the University of Washington Harborview Injury Prevention & Research Center (R49 CE003087, PI: Monica S. Vavilala, MD). The funder had no role in the analysis or interpretation of the data.",

        "Abstract": "Biopolymers like starch, a renewable and widely available resource, are increasingly being used to fabricate the films for eco-friendly packaging solutions. Starch-based edible films offer significant advantages for food packaging, including biodegradability and the ability to extend shelf life. However, they also present challenges such as moisture sensitivity and limited barrier properties compared to synthetic materials. These limitations can be mitigated by incorporating bioactive components, such as antimicrobial agents or antioxidants, which enhance the film's resistance to moisture and improve its barrier properties, making it a more viable option for food packaging. This review explores the emerging field of starch-based sustainable edible films enhanced with bioactive components for food packaging applications.

        "Abstract": "Our previous study identified 8 risk and 9 protective plasma miRNAs associated with progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in diabetes. This study aimed to elucidate preanalytical factors that influence the quantification of circulating miRNAs. Using the EdgeSeq platform, which quantifies 2,002 miRNAs in plasma, including ESKD-associated miRNAs, we compared miRNA profiles in whole plasma versus miRNA profiles in RNA extracted from the same plasma specimens. Less than half of the miRNAs were detected in standard RNA extraction from plasma. Detection of individual and concentrations of miRNAs were much lower when RNA extracted from plasma was quantified by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) or quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) platforms compared with EdgeSeq. Plasma profiles of miRNAs determined by the EdgeSeq platform had excellent reproducibility in assessment and had no variation with age, sex, hemoglobin A1c, BMI, and cryostorage time. The risk ESKD-associated miRNAs were detected and measured accurately only in whole plasma and using the EdgeSeq platform. Protective ESKD-associated miRNAs were detected by all platforms except qRT-PCR; however, correlations among concentrations obtained with different platforms were weak or nonexistent. In conclusion, preanalytical factors have a profound effect on detection and quantification of circulating miRNAs in ESKD in diabetes. Quantification of miRNAs in whole plasma and using the EdgeSeq platform may be the preferable method to study profiles of circulating cell-free miRNAs associated with ESKD and possibly other diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Public health policy interventions are associated with many important public health achievements. To provide public health practitioners and decision makers with practical approaches for examining and employing evidence-based public health (EBPH) policy interventions, we describe the characteristics and benefits that distinguish EBPH policy interventions from programmatic interventions. These characteristics include focusing on health at a population level, focusing on upstream drivers of health, and involving less individual action than programmatic interventions. The benefits of EBPH policy interventions include more sustained effects on health than many programs and an enhanced ability to address health inequities. Early childhood education and universal preschool provide a case example that illustrates the distinction between EBPH policy and programmatic interventions. This review serves as the foundation for 3 concepts that support the effective use of public health policy interventions: applying core component thinking to understand the population health effects of EBPH policy interventions; understanding the influence of existing policies, policy supports, and the context in which a particular policy is implemented on the effectiveness of that policy; and employing a systems thinking approach to identify leverage points where policy implementation can have a meaningful effect.",

        "Abstract": "Polysaccharide-based nanogels offer a wide range of chemical compositions and are of great interest due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and their ability to display pH, temperature, or enzymatic response. In this work, we synthesized monodisperse and tunable pH-sensitive nanogels by crosslinking, through reductive amination, chitosan and partially oxidized maltodextrins, by keeping the concentration of chitosan close to its overlap concentration, i.e. in the dilute and semi-dilute regime. The chitosan/maltodextrin nanogels presented sizes ranging from 63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 to 279\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016\u00a0nm, showed quasi-spherical and cauliflower-like morphology, reached a \u03b6-potential of +36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mV and maintained a colloidal stability for up to 7\u00a0weeks. It was found that the size and surface charge of nanogels depended both on the oxidation degree of maltodextrins and chitosan concentration, as well as on its degree of acetylation and protonation, the latter tuned by pH. The pH-responsiveness of the nanogels was evidenced by an increased size, owed to swelling, and \u03b6-potential when pH was lowered. Finally, maltodextrin-chitosan biocompatible nanogels were assessed by cell viability assay performed using the HEK293T cell line.",

        "Abstract": "We develop a simulation framework for studying misinformation spread within online social networks that blends agent-based modeling and natural language processing techniques. While many other agent-based simulations exist in this space, questions over their fidelity and generalization to existing networks in part hinder their ability to drive policy-relevant decision making. To partially address these concerns, we create a 'digital clone' of a known misinformation sharing network by downloading social media histories for over ten thousand of its users. We parse these histories to both extract the structure of the network and model the nuanced ways in which information is shared and spread among its members. Unlike many other agent-based methods in this space, information sharing between users in our framework is sensitive to topic of discussion, user preferences, and online community dynamics. To evaluate the fidelity of our method, we seed our cloned network with a set of posts recorded in the base network and compare propagation dynamics between the two, observing reasonable agreement across the twin networks over a variety of metrics. Lastly, we explore how the cloned network may serve as a flexible, low-cost testbed for misinformation countermeasure evaluation and red teaming analysis. We hope the tools explored here augment existing efforts in the space and unlock new opportunities for misinformation countermeasure evaluation, a field that may become increasingly important to consider with the anticipated rise of misinformation campaigns fueled by generative artificial intelligence.",

        "Abstract": "Botswana serves as a model of success for HIV with 95% of people living with HIV (PLWH) virally suppressed. Yet, only 19% of PLWH and hypertension have controlled blood pressure. To address this gap, InterCARE, a care model that integrates HIV and hypertension care through a) provider training; b) adapted electronic health record; and c) treatment partners (peer support), was designed. This study presents results from our baseline assessment of the determinants and factors used to guide adaptations to InterCARE implementation strategies prior to a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation study.",

        "Abstract": "Discoveries in the field of genomics have revealed that non-coding genomic regions are not merely \"junk DNA\", but rather comprise critical elements involved in gene expression. These gene regulatory elements (GREs) include enhancers, insulators, silencers, and gene promoters. Notably, new evidence shows how mutations within these regions substantially influence gene expression programs, especially in the context of cancer. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have accelerated the identification of somatic and germline single nucleotide mutations in non-coding genomic regions. This review provides an overview of somatic and germline non-coding single nucleotide alterations affecting transcription factor binding sites in GREs, specifically involved in cancer biology. It also summarizes the technologies available for exploring GREs and the challenges associated with studying and characterizing non-coding single nucleotide mutations. Understanding the role of GRE alterations in cancer is essential for improving diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in the precision medicine era, leading to enhanced patient-centered clinical outcomes.",

Shape anomalies of the permanent molars and positional changes due to surgery have been documented. The aim of this study is to compare the long-term effects (>5 years) on the growth pattern of PRS-patients treated with an external mandibular distraction device with no-surgery cases and to investigate the dental development or damage. A retrospective cohort study was performed. PRS-patients with and without surgery were included. A digital cephalometric analysis was made to evaluate the growth pattern of the mandible between groups as well as with normal values. Nine of 19 patients underwent an external mandibular distraction. All children were extubated after 4-5 days with no signs of respiratory distress. Screw and device loosening presented in one patient. The articular and sellar angles were significantly larger and smaller, respectively, in the Surgery group. Mandibular distraction surgery might result in a 'growth boost' compared to the No-surgery group. No significant difference in dental development was found. Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is an effective way of relieving severe upper airway obstruction.",

        "Title": "Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparisons of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel to Mosunetuzumab for the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Follicular Lymphoma.",
        "Abstract": "Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) was the first chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy approved for relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) patients, while mosunetuzumab was the first bispecific monoclonal antibody approved in this population. In the absence of head-to-head evidence, this study sought to conduct a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) to estimate the comparative efficacy and safety of these treatments in 3rd line or higher (3L+) FL. The evidence base consisted of individual patient data (IPD) of all enrolled patients, regardless of infusion status, from the single-arm axi-cel trial, ZUMA-5 (NCT03105336), and aggregate data from the mosunetuzumab FL trial (NCT02500407) from publications identified through a systematic review. Efficacy outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DoR), objective response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CRR). Analyses used independent central review for both trials, where possible. Safety outcomes were cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurological events (NE), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Unanchored MAICs were conducted to align ZUMA-5 to the patient characteristics of the mosunetuzumab trial. For each outcome, prognostic factors were identified a priori through quantitative analysis and clinical experts. For time-to-event outcomes, hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox regression using IPD from ZUMA-5 and pseudo-IPD extracted from Kaplan-Meier plots for mosunetuzumab. Patient characteristics were well-aligned between trials leading to large effective-sample sizes after matching, ranging from 93.4 to 115.5, for ZUMA-5 (n = 127). In comparisons to mosunetuzumab (n = 90), axi-cel was associated with improved PFS (HR: 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.24-0.62) and DoR (HR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.27-0.76). Similarly, axi-cel led to higher ORR (OR: 3.87; 95% CI: 1.53-9.76) and CRR (OR: 2.80; 95% CI: 1.50-5.26). Although axi-cel was associated with a higher rate of all-grade CRS (OR: 5.54; 95% CI: 2.63-8.94) and NEs (OR: 3.54; 95% CI: 1.28-9.83), differences in grade \u22653 CRS and TRAEs were not statistically significant. Findings from this study show improved efficacy and more durable response for the treatment of 3L+ R/R FL with axi-cel relative to mosunetuzumab, with increased odds of all-grade CRS and NE, but not G3+ CRS and TRAEs.",

        "Abstract": "Peer advocacy can promote HIV protective behaviors, but little is known about the concordance on prevention advocacy(PA) reports between people living with HIV(PLWH) and their social network members. We examined prevalence and correlates of such concordance, and its association with the targeted HIV protective behavior of the social network member. Data were analyzed from 193 PLWH(index participants) and their 599 social network members(alters). Kappa statistics measured concordance between index and alter reports of PA in the past 3 months. Logistic and multinomial regressions evaluated the relationship between advocacy concordance and alter condom use and HIV testing behavior and correlates of PA concordance. Advocacy concordance was observed in 0.3% of index-alter dyads for PrEP discussion, 9% for condom use, 18% for HIV testing, 26% for care engagement, and 49% for antiretroviral use discussions. Fewer indexes reported condom use(23.5% vs. 28.1%;[Formula: see text]=3.7, p=0.05) and HIV testing(30.5% vs. 50.5%; [Formula: see text]=25.3, p<0.001) PA occurring. Condom advocacy concordance was higher if the index and alter were romantic partners(OR=3.50; p=0.02), and lower if the index was 10 years younger than the alter(OR=0.23; p\u2009=\u20090.02). Alters had higher odds of using condoms with their main partner when both reported condom advocacy compared to dyads where neither reported advocacy(OR=3.90; p<0.001) and compared to dyads where only the index reported such advocacy(OR\u2009=\u20093.71; p=0.01). Age difference and relationship status impact advocacy agreement, and concordant perceptions of advocacy are linked to increased HIV protective behaviors. Alters' perceptions may be crucial for behavior change, informing strategies for improving advocacy.",

Therefore, patients are often required to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to rule out esophageal varices (EV) prior to initiating therapy, which can delay care and lead to unnecessary procedural risks and health care costs. In 2019, the EVendo score was created and validated as a noninvasive tool to accurately screen out patients who were at low risk for having EV that required treatment.

        "Abstract": "Accurate estimation of the dispersal velocity or speed of evolving organisms is no mean feat. In fact, existing probabilistic models in phylogeography or spatial population genetics generally do not provide an adequate framework to define velocity in a relevant manner. For instance, the very concept of instantaneous speed simply does not exist under one of the most popular approaches that models the evolution of spatial coordinates as Brownian trajectories running along a phylogeny [30]. Here, we introduce a new family of models - the so-called \"Phylogenetic Integrated Velocity\" (PIV) models - that use Gaussian processes to explicitly model the velocity of evolving lineages instead of focusing on the fluctuation of spatial coordinates over time. We describe the properties of these models and show an increased accuracy of velocity estimates compared to previous approaches. Analyses of West Nile virus data in the U.S.A. indicate that PIV models provide sensible predictions of the dispersal of evolving pathogens at a one-year time horizon. These results demonstrate the feasibility and relevance of predictive phylogeography in monitoring epidemics in time and space.",

        "Title": "Combined Regional Approach of Talimogene laherparepvec and Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Advanced Melanoma.",
        "Abstract": "Talimogene laherparepvec (TVEC) is a genetically modified oncolytic herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) that is used for the intralesional treatment of advanced or metastatic melanoma. Given that TVEC produces the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), recent reports have suggested that radiation treatment (RT) given in conjunction with TVEC may provide synergistic immune activation at the site, and possibly systemically. However, studies on combining RT with TVEC remain limited. We conducted a retrospective review of melanoma patients from a single cancer center who received TVEC and RT in the same region of the body and compared them to patients who received TVEC with RT at another site (other than the site of TVEC injection). Between January 2015 and September 2022, we identified twenty patients who were treated with TVEC and RT; fourteen patients received TVEC and RT in the same region, and six had treatments in separate regions. Regions were determined at the time of analysis and were based on anatomic sites (such as arm, leg, torso, etc.). Kaplan-Meier analysis of progression-free survival (PFS), analyses of time to distant metastasis (DM), overall survival (OS), and locoregional control (LRC), and the corresponding log-rank test were performed. With a median follow-up of 10.5 months [mos] (range 1.0-58.7 mos), we found an improvement in PFS with TVEC and RT in the same region compared to different regions, which were 6.4 mos (95% CI, 2.4-NR mos) and 2.8 mos (95% CI, 0.7-4.4 mos), respectively; ",

In Canada and globally, the transition to adult care is regarded as a top priority in adolescent health in need of readily applicable, adaptable, and relevant national metrics to evaluate and benchmark transition success across disease populations and clinical care settings. Unfortunately, existing literature fails to account for the lack of engagement from youth and caregivers in developing indicators, and its applicability across chronic conditions, primary care involvement, and health equity considerations.",

        "Title": "Families as partners in neonatal neuro-critical care programs.",
        "Abstract": "Parents of neonates with neurologic conditions face a specific breadth of emotional, logistical, and social challenges, including difficulties coping with prognostic uncertainty, the need to make complex medical decisions, and navigating new hopes and fears. These challenges place parents in a vulnerable position and at risk of developing mental health issues, which can interfere with bonding and caring for their neonate, as well as compromise their neonate's long-term neurodevelopment. To optimize neurologic and developmental outcomes, emerging neonatal neuro-critical care (NNCC) programs must concurrently attend to the unique needs of the developing newborn brain and of his/her parents. This can only be accomplished by embracing a family-centered care environment-one which prioritizes effective parent-clinician communication, longitudinal parent support, and parents as equitable partners in clinical care. NNCC programs offer a multifaceted approach to critical care for neonates at-risk for neurodevelopmental impairments, integrating expertise in neonatology and neurology. This review highlights evidence-based strategies to guide NNCC programs in developing a family-partnered approach to care, including primary staffing models; staff communication, implicit bias, and cultural competency trainings; comprehensive and tailored caregiver training; single-family rooms; flexible visitation policies; colocalized neonatal and maternal care; uniform mental health screenings; follow-up care referrals; and connections to peer support. IMPACT: Parents of neonates with neurologic conditions are at high-risk for experiencing mental health issues, which can adversely impact the parent-neonate relationship and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of their neonates. While guidelines to promote families as partners in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) have been developed, no protocols integrate the unique needs of parents in neonatal neurologic populations. A holistic approach that makes families true partners in the care of their neonate with a neurologic condition in the NICU has the potential to improve mental and physical well-being for both parents and neonates.",

        "Abstract": "Immunocompromised individuals are at significantly elevated risk for severe courses of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition to vaccination,\u00a0severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) have been applied throughout the pandemic, with time of treatment onset and potency against the currently prevailing virus variant identified as relevant factors for medical benefit. Using data from the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) registry, the present study evaluated COVID-19 cases in three groups of patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI; 981 agammaglobulinemia patients on immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IGRT); 8960 non-agammaglobulinemia patients on IGRT; 14\u2009428 patients without IGRT), and the neutralizing capacity of 1100 immunoglobulin lots against SARS-CoV-2 (\"Wuhan\" and Omicron strains), throughout 3 years. From the first (2020/2021) to the second (2021/2022) cold season, i.e., during the virus drift to the more contagious Omicron variants, an increase in case numbers was recorded that was comparable (~2- to 3-fold) for all three study groups. During the same period, immunoglobulin lots showed a profound nAb increase against the archetypal SARS-CoV-2 strain, yet only low levels of Omicron nAbs. Notably, shortly before the third (2022/2023) cold season, Omicron-neutralizing capacity of released immunoglobulin lots had plateaued at high levels. From the second to the third cold season, COVID-19 cases dropped markedly. While a ~6-fold case reduction was recorded for the groups of non-agammaglobulinemia patients on IGRT and IEI patients not receiving IGRT, the decline was ~30-fold for the group of agammaglobulinemia patients on IGRT. These findings suggest a substantial COVID-19-protective effect of IGRT, at least for distinct groups of antibody-deficient patients.",

        "Abstract": "The family Acuariidae is a speciose group of parasitic nematodes, infecting mostly birds as definitive hosts. This study focused on the characterization of two species of acuariids, collected in two different species of piscivorous birds, the European great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis from Italy, and the pygmy cormorant Microcarbo pygmaeus from Israel. Parasites were analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy and by amplification and sequencing of the 28S rDNA. The results of morphological and molecular analyses showed that Ph. carbo sinensis was infected by the acuariid Syncuaria squamata (12 females) and Cosmocephalus obvelatus (1 female), whereas M. pygmaeus was infected by C. obvelatus (2 males, 12 females). The present results provide new data on the distribution of acuariid parasites of piscivorous birds, the first report of Acuariidae in Israel, and the first molecular data on S. squamata and C. obvelatus, which will be useful in future epidemiological and phylogenetic studies of these widely distributed, but less molecularly studied parasites.",

        "Abstract": "Microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer (MSS mCRC; mismatch repair proficient) has previously responded poorly to immune checkpoint blockade. Botensilimab (BOT) is an Fc-enhanced multifunctional anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antibody designed to expand therapy to cold/poorly immunogenic solid tumors, such as MSS mCRC. BOT with or without balstilimab (BAL; anti-PD-1 antibody) is being evaluated in an ongoing expanded phase 1 study. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability, which was evaluated separately in the dose-escalation portion of the study and in patients with MSS mCRC (using combined dose-escalation/dose-expansion data). Secondary endpoints include investigator-assessed RECIST version 1.1-confirmed objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Here we present outcomes in 148 heavily pre-treated patients with MSS mCRC (six from the dose-escalation cohort; 142 from the dose-expansion cohort) treated with BOT and BAL, 101 of whom were considered response evaluable with at least 6\u2009months of follow-up. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 89% of patients with MSS mCRC (131/148), most commonly fatigue (35%, 52/148), diarrhea (32%, 47/148) and pyrexia (24%, 36/148), with no grade 5 TRAEs reported and a 12% discontinuation rate due to a TRAE (18/148; data fully mature). In the response-evaluable population (n\u2009=\u2009101), ORR was 17% (17/101; 95% confidence interval (CI), 10-26%), and DCR was 61% (62/101; 95% CI, 51-71%). Median DOR was not reached (NR; 95% CI, 5.7\u2009months-NR), and median PFS was 3.5\u2009months (95% CI, 2.7-4.1\u2009months), at a median follow-up of 10.3\u2009months (range, 0.5-42.6\u2009months; data continuing to mature). The combination of BOT plus BAL demonstrated a manageable safety profile with no new immune-mediated safety signals and encouraging clinical activity with durable responses.

        "Abstract": "Immigration-related problems and stressors are prevalent and pressing concerns among Latinx and Asian American school-age youth. Youth fears related to family deportation have been associated with adverse mental health outcomes. This study used an ecological framework to examine the impact of immigration stress and school- and community-level resources and protective factors on Latinx and Asian American youth internalizing symptoms. The sample included 1309 Asian American and 701 Latinx students (N\u00a0=\u00a02010) who participated in a routine school-based mental health needs assessment survey. Multilevel regressions analyses revealed that first-generation youth, Latinx youth, and female youth were more vulnerable to experiencing immigration-related problems and worry. Student perceptions of negative school climate and community violence were associated with greater internalizing symptoms regardless of immigration worry. Moderation analyses revealed that immigration-related problems and worry were positively associated with internalizing symptoms and that this relationship did not differ by race/ethnicity. However, immigration worry was a particular risk factor for students who perceived their neighborhood community as safe. Findings highlight that a sociopolitical climate that sows immigration-related challenges fuels youth distress and that students' experiences of their community environment can play an essential role as a psychological resource.",

        "Abstract": "The flavonoid family is a set of well-known bioactive natural molecules, with a wide range of potential therapeutic applications. Despite the promising results obtained in preliminary in vitro/vivo studies, their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles are severely compromised by chemical instability. To address this issue, the scaffold-hopping approach is a promising strategy for the structural optimization of natural leads to discover more potent analogues. In this scenario, this Perspective provides a critical analysis on how the replacement of the chromon-4-one flavonoid core with other bioisosteric nitrogen/sulphur heterocycles might affect the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological properties of the resulting new chemical entities. The investigated derivatives were classified on the basis of their biological activity and potential therapeutic indications. For each session, the target(s), the specific mechanism of action, if available, and the key pharmacophoric moieties were highlighted, as revealed by X-ray crystal structures and in silico structure-based studies. Biological activity data, in vitro/vivo studies, were examined: a particular focus was given on the improvements observed with the new heterocyclic analogues compared to the natural flavonoids. This overview of the scaffold-hopping advantages in flavonoid compounds is of great interest to the medicinal chemistry community to better exploit the vast potential of these natural molecules and to identify new bioactive molecules.",

        "Abstract": "Sexual minority men (gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men; SMM) in Nigeria are disproportionately affected by HIV compared to heterosexual men. There is a dearth of research on the correlates of antiretroviral therapy (ART) non-adherence and correlates in both groups. The current study examined the associations of ART non-adherence with sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics among a sample of Nigerian heterosexual and SMM. Between March and September 2014, we surveyed 120 SMM and 108 heterosexual men receiving ART in Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria. We specified univariate and multivariable linear regression models to examine correlates of ART non-adherence. We found that 50.8% and 29.6% of sexual minority and heterosexual men respectively self-reported ART non-adherence which was significantly associated with psychosocial factors such as stigma, depressive symptoms, and suicidality. Mental health care and psychosocial support should be incorporated into routine HIV care for Nigerian SMM living with HIV.",

        "Title": "Ecological \"Windows of opportunity\" influence biofilm prokaryotic diversity differently in glacial and non-glacial Alpine streams.",
        "Abstract": "In glacier-fed streams, the Windows of Opportunity (WOs) are periods of mild environmental conditions supporting the seasonal development of benthic microorganisms. WOs have been defined based on changes in biofilm biomass, but the responses of microbial diversity to WOs in Alpine streams have been overlooked. A two year (2017-2018) metabarcoding of epilithic and epipsammic biofilm prokaryotes was conducted in Alpine streams fed by glaciers (kryal), rock glaciers (rock glacial), or groundwater/precipitation (krenal) in two catchments of the Central-Eastern European Alps (Italy), aiming at testing the hypothesis that: 1) environmental WOs enhance not only the biomass but also the \u03b1-diversity of the prokaryotic biofilm in all stream types, 2) diversity and phenology of prokaryotic biofilm are mainly influenced by the physical habitat in glacial streams, and by water chemistry in the other two stream types. The study confirmed kryal and krenal streams as endmembers of epilithic and sediment prokaryotic \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity, with rock glacial streams sharing a large proportion of taxa with the two other stream types. Alpha-diversity appeared to respond to ecological WOs, but, contrary to expectations, seasonality was less pronounced in the turbid kryal than in the clear streams. This was attributed to the small size of the glaciers feeding the studied kryal streams, whose discharge dynamics were those typical of the late phase of deglaciation. Prokaryotic \u03b1-diversity of non-glacial streams tended to be higher in early summer than in early autumn. Our findings, while confirming that high altitude streams are heavily threatened by climate change, underscore the still neglected role of rock glacier runoffs as climate refugia for the most stenothermic benthic aquatic microorganism. This advocates the need to define and test strategies for protecting these ecosystems for preserving, restoring, and connecting cold Alpine aquatic biodiversity in the context of the progressing global warming.",

        "Title": "Does type of antiretroviral therapy pick-up point influence 12-month virologic suppression in South Africa?",
        "Abstract": "We assessed the impact of community- versus clinic-based medication pick-up on rates of virologic suppression in an observational cohort of adults on ART enrolled in a decentralized antiretroviral therapy program (CCMDD) in South Africa. Participants either attended clinics where they were given the choice to pick up ART in community venues or traditional clinics, or clinics where this pathway was assigned. Among 1856 participants, 977 (53%) opted for community ART pick-up at enrollment, and 1201 (86%) were virologically suppressed at one year. Because of missing data on virologic suppression, primary results are based on a model incorporating multiple imputation. In addition to age and gender, distance from clinic and year of HIV diagnosis were included in the multivariable model. There was no difference in opting for clinic- vs. community-based pick-up with regard to achieving 12-month virologic suppression (aRR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98-1.05) in clinics offering choice. There was no impact of assigning all participants to an external pick-up point (aRR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.06), but virologic suppression was reduced in the clinic that assigned participants to clinic pick-up (aRR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.92). These results suggest that provision of community-based ART has not reduced continued virologic suppression in the population enrolled in the CCMDD program.",

Traditionally, the Brand transfer is a favored intervention but requires lengthy grafts and bulky tenorrhaphies, risking adhesions in the lumbrical canal. We present a modified Brand tendon transfer, which extends the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) into 4 tails for individual grafting into the lateral band, decreasing adhesion risk and graft length need.",

The aim of this national survey was to assess how gastroenterologists and general practitioners use rifaximin to manage diverticulosis and diverticular disease.\u00a0Members of the\u00a0Italian Association of Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (AIGO) and the Italian Federation of General Practitioners (FIMMG)\u00a0were invited to complete a 39-item online survey concerning the use of rifaximin in five clinical settings: (1) diverticulosis; (2) reducing symptoms in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease;\u00a0(3) reducing the occurrence of diverticulitis in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (primary prevention);\u00a0(4) reducing the recurrence of diverticulitis in patients with previous attacks of diverticulitis (secondary prevention);\u00a0(5) treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.\u00a0A total of 1094 physicians completed the survey. Overall, 25.1%, 83.5%, 68%, 74.2%, and 63% of physicians prescribed rifaximin for the clinical settings 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. In each clinical setting, the dosage of rifaximin most frequently used was 800\u00a0mg/day, the most common duration of therapy was 7\u00a0days, and the cyclic administration of treatment (expressed in months) most frequently used was\u2009>\u200924\u00a0months. These results highlight that a reappraisal of the use of rifaximin in patients with diverticulosis and diverticular disease is required to reduce the gap between the evidence available and the daily clinical practice, optimizing also the use of healthcare resources.",

        "Abstract": "The impact of common and rare variants in COVID-19 host genetics has been widely studied. In particular, in Fallerini et al. (Human genetics, 2022, 141, 147-173), common and rare variants were used to define an interpretable machine learning model for predicting COVID-19 severity. First, variants were converted into sets of Boolean features, depending on the absence or the presence of variants in each gene. An ensemble of LASSO logistic regression models was used to identify the most informative Boolean features with respect to the genetic bases of severity. After that, the Boolean features, selected by these logistic models, were combined into an Integrated PolyGenic Score (IPGS), which offers a very simple description of the contribution of host genetics in COVID-19 severity.. IPGS leads to an accuracy of 55%-60% on different cohorts, and, after a logistic regression with both IPGS and age as inputs, it leads to an accuracy of 75%. The goal of this paper is to improve the previous results, using not only the most informative Boolean features with respect to the genetic bases of severity but also the information on host organs involved in the disease. In this study, we generalize the IPGS adding a statistical weight for each organ, through the transformation of Boolean features into \"Boolean quantum features,\" inspired by quantum mechanics. The organ coefficients were set via the application of the genetic algorithm PyGAD, and, after that, we defined two new integrated polygenic scores (",

        "Abstract": "Persons with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) experience three co-existing stigmatizing health conditions: skin disease, HIV, and cancer, which contribute to a complex experience of stigmatization and to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Despite the importance of stigma among these patients, there are few proven stigma-reduction strategies for HIV-associated malignancies. Using qualitative methods, we explore how people with HIV-associated KS in western Kenya between August 2022 and 2023 describe changes in their stigma experience after participation in a multicomponent navigation strategy, which included 1) physical navigation and care coordination, 2) video-based education with motivational survivor stories, 3) travel stipend, 4) health insurance enrollment assistance, 5) health insurance stipend, and 6) peer mentorship. A purposive sample of persons at different stages of chemotherapy treatment were invited to participate. Participants described how a multicomponent navigation strategy contributed to increased knowledge and awareness, a sense of belonging, hope to survive, encouragement, and social support, which served as stigma mitigators, likely counteracting the major drivers of intersectional stigma in HIV-associated KS.",

Older workers generally face higher job automation risks in part due to their lower levels of digital skills. A better understanding of the associations between job automation risk, digital skills, and type of occupation (e.g., STEM vs non-STEM) can facilitate preparations for job automation and workforce population aging.",

        "Abstract": "Technological advances in radiation therapy impact on the role and scope of practice of the radiation therapist. The European Society of Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) recently held two workshops on this topic and this position paper reflects the outcome of this workshop, which included radiation therapists from all global regions. Workflows, quality assurance, research, IGRT and ART as well as clinical decision making are the areas of radiation therapist practice that will be highly influenced by advancing technology in the near future. This position paper captures the opportunities that this will bring to the radiation therapist profession, to the practice of radiation therapy and ultimately to patient care.",

        "Abstract": "An unmet need exists for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) and high-risk disease features, such as progression of disease within 24\u2009months (POD24) from first-line immunochemotherapy or disease refractory to both CD20-targeting agent and alkylator (double refractory), due to no established standard of care and poor outcomes. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is an option in R/R FL after two or more lines of prior systemic therapy, but there is no consensus on its optimal timing in the disease course of FL, and there are no data in second-line (2L) treatment of patients with high-risk features. Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) is an autologous, CD19-directed, 4-1BB CAR T cell product. The phase 2 TRANSCEND FL study evaluated liso-cel in patients with R/R FL, including 2L patients who all had POD24 from diagnosis after treatment with anti-CD20 antibody and alkylator \u22646\u2009months of FL diagnosis and/or met modified Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires criteria. Primary/key secondary endpoints were independent review committee-assessed overall response rate (ORR)/complete response (CR) rate. At data cutoff, 130 patients had received liso-cel (median follow-up, 18.9\u2009months). Primary/key secondary endpoints were met. In third-line or later FL (n\u2009=\u2009101), ORR was 97% (95% confidence interval (CI): 91.6\u201299.4), and CR rate was 94% (95% CI: 87.5\u201297.8). In 2L FL (n\u2009=\u200923), ORR was 96% (95% CI: 78.1\u201299.9); all responders achieved CR. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 58% of patients (grade \u22653, 1%); neurological events occurred in 15% of patients (grade \u22653, 2%). Liso-cel demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with R/R FL, including high-risk 2L FL. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04245839 .",

        "Abstract": "Public health practice appears poised to undergo a transformative shift as a result of the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). These changes will usher in a new era of public health, charged with responding to deficiencies identified during the COVID-19 pandemic and managing investments required to meet the health needs of the twenty-first century. In this Commentary, we explore how AI is being used in public health, and we describe the advanced capabilities of generative AI models capable of producing synthetic content such as images, videos, audio, text, and other digital content. Viewing the use of AI from the perspective of health departments in the United States, we examine how this new technology can support core public health functions with a focus on near-term opportunities to improve communication, optimize organizational performance, and generate novel insights to drive decision making. Finally, we review the challenges and risks associated with these technologies, offering suggestions for health officials to harness the new tools to accomplish public health goals.",

        "Abstract": "Reproductive outcomes after uterine artery embolization (UAE) for the treatment of uterine fibroids are challenging to study, leaving several unanswered questions surrounding the future fertility of patients undergoing the procedure. Subject matter experts from interventional radiology, diagnostic radiology, obstetrics and gynecology, and reproductive medicine participated in a Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) Foundation Research Consensus Panel to discuss and prioritize critical research topics focusing on fertility and reproductive outcomes in patients undergoing UAE for symptomatic uterine fibroids. After presentations and discussion of research ideas, the panelists prioritized the following topics for further investigation: (a) a prospective study of factors that influence implantation and gene expression in patients undergoing UAE or myomectomy over 1 year; (b) refinement of a classification system for uterine fibroids that can allow for more focused study design, which may include burden of fibroid disease; and (c) conjoint analysis/discrete choice experiments to better characterize those patients for whom fertility preservation is a high priority.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, the intra-operative visualization of vessels during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) relies on contrast-based imaging modalities. Moreover, traditional image fusion techniques lack a continuous and automatic update of the vessel configuration, which changes due to the insertion of stiff guidewires. The purpose of this work is to develop and evaluate a novel approach to improve image fusion, that takes into account the deformations, combining electromagnetic (EM) tracking technology and finite element modeling (FEM).",

        "Abstract": "The intricate origins and diverse symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pose significant challenges for both diagnosis and treatment. Exosomes and microvesicles, which carry disease-specific cargo from a variety of central nervous system cell types, have emerged as promising reservoirs of biomarkers for AD. Research on the screening of possible biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease using proteomic profiling of EVs is systematically reviewed in this comprehensive review. We highlight key methodologies employed in EV isolation, characterization, and proteomic analysis, elucidating their advantages and limitations. Furthermore, we summarize the evolving landscape of EV-associated biomarkers implicated in AD pathogenesis, including proteins involved in amyloid-beta metabolism, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal injury. The literature review highlights the necessity for robust validation strategies and standardized protocols to effectively transition EV-based biomarkers into clinical use. In the concluding section, this review delves into potential future avenues and technological advancements pivotal in crafting EV-derived biomarkers applicable to AD diagnostics and prognostics. This review contributes to our comprehension of AD pathology and the advancement of precision medicine in neurodegenerative diseases, hinting at a promising era in AD precision medicine.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) are a group of structural abnormalities or defects of the heart that are present at birth. CHDs could be connected to sudden death (SD), defined by the WHO (World Health Organization) as \"death occurring within 24 h after the onset of the symptoms\" in an apparently \"healthy\" subject. These conditions can range from relatively mild defects to severe, life-threatening anomalies. The prevalence of CHDs varies across populations, but they affect millions of individuals worldwide. This article aims to discuss the post-mortem investigation of death related to CHDs, exploring the forensic approach, current methodologies, challenges, and potential advancements in this challenging field. A further goal of this article is to provide a guide for understanding these complex diseases, highlighting the pivotal role of autopsy, histopathology, and genetic investigations in defining the cause of death, and providing evidence about the translational use of autopsy reports. Forensic investigations play a crucial role in understanding the complexities of CHDs and determining the cause of death accurately. Through collaboration between medical professionals and forensic experts, meticulous examinations, and analysis of evidence, valuable insights can be gained. These insights not only provide closure to the families affected but also contribute to the prevention of future tragedies.",

        "Abstract": "Health-related social control (HRSC) includes efforts to regulate or influence others' health behaviors and is an important way interpersonal relationships can affect individual-level health. This study used egocentric network data to describe the size and composition of HRSC networks, identify trajectories of HRSC receipt, and examine how HRSC is related to binge drinking and alcohol-related problems. Data come from a U.S. nationally representative sample of 1235 adults age 30 and older (baseline mean age\u00a0=\u00a052, 52% female, 64% White) who completed four annual surveys between 2019 and 2022. On average, 30% of adults' network members were HRSC agents who told or reminded them to do things to protect their health. At baseline, 50% of respondents identified a spouse/partner as a HRSC agent, 56% a relative, 46% a friend, and 12% someone else. Respondents' relationships with HRSC agents were generally strong, 93% of agents were described as people \"whose opinion matters,\" and only 10% were described as hassling or making life difficult for the respondent. Growth mixture modeling identified five trajectories of HRSC receipt over the four-year period: Stable High (36% of sample), Stable Moderate (47%), Stable Low (14%), Decreasing (2%), and Increasing (2%). Binge drinking was relatively consistent for the three Stable HRSC classes (ranging from 11% to 15% of individuals), decreased steadily for the Increasing HRSC class (32%-16%), and fluctuated for the Decreasing HRSC class (decreasing from 10% to 2%, then increasing to 8%). For alcohol problems, the Increasing HRSC class showed the largest increase (2%-21%) before dropping to near-baseline levels (4%), whereas the Decreasing HRSC class fluctuated during the first three waves followed by no individuals reporting alcohol problems at the last wave. Results highlight the importance of examining heterogeneity in adults' HRSC experiences because of its implications for understanding social influences on health-related behaviors.",

We calculated reported unfair treatment rates overall and by enrollee characteristics. Nine percent of respondents reported any unfair treatment, most often based on health condition (6%), disability (3%), or age (2%). Approximately 40% of those reporting any unfair treatment endorsed multiple categories. People who qualified for Medicare via disability reported unfair treatment by disability, age, income, race and ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, and gender/gender identity more often than those who qualified via age. Enrollees dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid or eligible for a Low-Income Subsidy (DE/LIS) reported unfair treatment by disability, income, language/accent, race and ethnicity, culture/religion, and sex more often than non-DE/LIS enrollees. Compared with White respondents, racial and ethnic minority respondents more often reported unfair treatment by race and ethnicity, language/accent, culture/religion, and income. Female respondents were more likely than male respondents to report unfair treatment based on age and sex.",

        "Abstract": "Are teenage and adult smoking causally related? Recent anti-tobacco policy is predicated on the assumption that preventing teenagers from smoking will ensure that fewer adults smoke, but direct evidence in support of this assumption is scant. Using data from three nationally representative sources and instrumenting for teenage smoking with cigarette taxes experienced at ages 14-17, we document a strong positive relationship between teenage and adult smoking: deterring 10 teenagers from smoking through raising cigarette taxes roughly translates into 5 fewer adult smokers. We conclude that efforts to reduce teenage smoking can have long-lasting consequences on smoking participation and, presumably, health.",

        "Abstract": "We developed an expert panel approach for identifying expert views on the effectiveness and implementability of population-level policy interventions. ROMPER-the RAND/USC OPTIC Method for Policy Expert Ratings-involves an online, three-round, modified-Delphi process:\u2022Experts rate and comment on policies according to domains of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Evidence-to-Decision framework.\u2022To identify consensus on policy effectiveness and implementability, expert ratings are analyzed using the Inter-Percentile Range Adjusted for Symmetry (IPRAS) technique from the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and visualized using a forest plot. To explain consensus, expert comments are analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis and reported following the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research.\u2022To provide actionable information for decisionmakers, each policy is summarized in a \"Policy Profile\" adapted from GRADEPro Evidence-to-Decision tables.We validated ROMPER in two studies that successfully recruited the targeted sample size, retained experts through all three rounds, and examined consensus on which policies are (not) effective and implementable. ROMPER protocols, materials, data, and code are openly available on the Open Science Framework with Creative Commons licensing for replication and reuse. ROMPER provides a validated, replicable, open access approach for eliciting expert views on both policy effectiveness and implementability-and for summarizing (lack of) consensus specifically for policymakers.",

        "Abstract": "Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) is a clinical sequela of central nervous system metastasis involving the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), often seen in late-stage solid tumors. It has a grave prognosis without urgent treatment. Standard of care methodologies to diagnose LMD include CSF cytology, magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical evaluation. These methods offer limited sensitivity and specificity for the evaluation of LMD. Here, we describe the analytic performance characteristics of a microfluidic-based tumor cell enrichment and detection assay optimized to detect epithelial cells in CSF using both contrived samples as well as CSF from patients having suspected or confirmed LMD from carcinomas.",

        "Abstract": "Atmospheric pollution is a major public health issue and has become increasingly critical for human health. Urban atmospheric pollution is typically assessed through physicochemical indicators aligned with environmental legislation parameters, providing data on air quality levels. While the effects of pollution on sensitive organisms serve as a warning for public health decision-makers, there remains a need to explore the interpretation of environmental data on pollutants. The use of species adapted to urban environments as sentinels enables continuous and integrated monitoring of environmental pollution implications on biological systems. In this study, we investigated the use of the plant species Tradescantia pallida as a biomonitor to evaluate the genotoxic effects of atmospheric pollution under diverse vehicular traffic conditions. T. pallida was strategically planted at the leading urban intersections in Uberl\u00e2ndia, Brazil. During COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, we compared indicators such as physical, biological, and traffic data at different intersections in residential and commercial zones. The reduction in vehicular traffic highlighted the sensitivity of plant species to changes in air and soil pollutants. T. pallida showed bioaccumulation of heavy metals Cd and Cr in monitored areas with higher traffic levels. Additionally, we established a multiple linear regression model to estimate genotoxicity using the micronucleus test, with chromium concentration in the soil (X1) and particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere (X2) identified as the primary independent variables. Our findings provide a comprehensive portrait of the impact of vehicular traffic changes on PM and offer valuable insights for refining parameters and models of Environmental Health Surveillance.",

        "Abstract": "Markers that allow for the selection of tailored treatments for individual patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are yet to be identified. Our aim was to describe trends in real-life treatment usage. For this purpose, patients from the ENEIDA registry who received their first targeted IBD treatment (biologics or tofacitinib) between 2015 and 2021 were included. A subsequent analysis with Machine Learning models was performed. The study included 10,009 patients [71% with Crohn's disease (CD) and 29% with ulcerative colitis (UC)]. In CD, anti-TNF (predominantly adalimumab) were the main agents in the 1st line of treatment (LoT), although their use declined over time. In UC, anti-TNF (mainly infliximab) use was predominant in 1st LoT, remaining stable over time. Ustekinumab and vedolizumab were the most prescribed drugs in 2nd and 3rd LoT in CD and UC, respectively. Overall, the use of biosimilars increased over time. Machine Learning failed to identify a model capable of predicting treatment patterns. In conclusion, drug positioning is different in CD and UC. Anti-TNF were the most used drugs in IBD 1st LoT, being adalimumab predominant in CD and infliximab in UC. Ustekinumab and vedolizumab have gained importance in CD and UC, respectively. The approval of biosimilars had a significant impact on treatment.",

        "Title": "Methylglyoxal and Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs): Targets for the Prevention and Treatment of Diabetes-Associated Bladder Dysfunction?",
        "Abstract": "Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a highly reactive \u03b1-dicarbonyl compound formed endogenously from 3-carbon glycolytic intermediates. Methylglyoxal accumulated in plasma and urine of hyperglycemic and diabetic individuals acts as a potent peptide glycation molecule, giving rise to advanced glycation end products (AGEs) like arginine-derived hydroimidazolone (MG-H1) and carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL). Methylglyoxal-derived AGEs exert their effects mostly via activation of RAGE, a cell surface receptor that initiates multiple intracellular signaling pathways, favoring a pro-oxidant environment through NADPH oxidase activation and generation of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Diabetic bladder dysfunction is a bothersome urological complication in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and may comprise overactive bladder, urge incontinence, poor emptying, dribbling, incomplete emptying of the bladder, and urinary retention. Preclinical models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes have further confirmed the relationship between diabetes and voiding dysfunction. Interestingly, healthy mice supplemented with MGO for prolonged periods exhibit in vivo and in vitro bladder dysfunction, which is accompanied by increased AGE formation and RAGE expression, as well as by ROS overproduction in bladder tissues. Drugs reported to scavenge MGO and to inactivate AGEs like metformin, polyphenols, and alagebrium (ALT-711) have shown favorable outcomes on bladder dysfunction in diabetic obese leptin-deficient and MGO-exposed mice. Therefore, MGO, AGEs, and RAGE levels may be critically involved in the pathogenesis of bladder dysfunction in diabetic individuals. However, there are no clinical trials designed to test drugs that selectively inhibit the MGO-AGEs-RAGE signaling, aiming to reduce the manifestations of diabetes-associated bladder dysfunction. This review summarizes the current literature on the role of MGO-AGEs-RAGE-ROS axis in diabetes-associated bladder dysfunction. Drugs that directly inactivate MGO and ameliorate bladder dysfunction are also reviewed here.",

Its determination is an essential reference to the quality of biofuel and a significant parameter to be determined. This parameter concerns the quality of the biodiesel to be supplied to the consumer, and its determination is fundamental to maintaining the engine's proper functioning. Raman spectroscopy allows the rapid obtaining of structural information regarding biodiesel quality and, when aided by multivariate analysis methods, allows a quantitative determination of specific properties. This work uses Raman spectroscopy, Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternative Least Squares (MCR-ALS) method, and Evolving Factor Analysis (EFA) to study biodiesel's oxidation kinetics.

        "Abstract": "Today, colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis is performed using colonoscopy, which is the current, most effective screening method. However, colonoscopy poses risks of harm to the patient and is an invasive process. Recent research has proven metabolomics as a potential, non-invasive detection method, which can use identified biomarkers to detect potential cancer in a patient's body. The aim of this study is to develop a machine-learning (ML) model based on chemical descriptors that will recognize CRC-associated metabolites. We selected a set of metabolites found as the biomarkers of CRC, confirmed that they participate in cancer-related pathways, and used them for training a machine-learning model for the diagnostics of CRC. Using a set of selective metabolites and random compounds, we developed a range of ML models. The best performing ML model trained on Stage 0-2 CRC metabolite data predicted a metabolite class with 89.55% accuracy. The best performing ML model trained on Stage 3-4 CRC metabolite data predicted a metabolite class with 95.21% accuracy. Lastly, the best-performing ML model trained on Stage 0-4 CRC metabolite data predicted a metabolite class with 93.04% accuracy. These models were then tested on independent datasets, including random and unrelated-disease metabolites. In addition, six pathways related to these CRC metabolites were also distinguished: aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis; arginine biosynthesis; and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Thus, in this research study, we created machine-learning models based on metabolite-related descriptors that may be helpful in developing a non-invasive diagnosis method for CRC.",

        "Abstract": "A growing body of literature uses the concept of core components to better understand small-scale programmatic interventions. Instead of interventions being viewed as unitary \"black boxes,\" interventions are viewed as configurations of core components, which are the parts of interventions that carry their causal potential and therefore need to be reproduced with fidelity to produce the intended effect. To date, the concept of core components has not been as widely applied to public health policy interventions as it has to programmatic interventions. The purpose of this topical review is to familiarize public health practitioners and policy makers with the concept of core components as applied to public health policy interventions. Raising the profile of core component thinking can foster mindful adaptation and implementation of public health policy interventions while encouraging further research to enhance the supporting evidence base. We present 3 types of multilevel interactions in which the core components of a public health policy intervention produce effects at the population level by (1) seeking to directly affect individual behavior, (2) facilitating adoption of programmatic interventions by intermediaries, and (3) encouraging intermediaries to take action that can shape changes in upstream drivers of population health. Changing the unit of analysis from whole policies to core components can provide a basis for understanding how policies work and for facilitating novel evidence-generating strategies and rapid evidence reviews that can inform future adaptation efforts.",

However, a gap exists in understanding the comprehensive value-based perspectives of other professionals involved in both somatic and psychiatric euthanasia. This paper aims to analyze the interplay among legal, medical, and ethical factors to clarify how foundational values shape the ethical discourse surrounding euthanasia in both somatic and psychiatric contexts. It seeks to explore these dynamics among all healthcare professionals and volunteers in Belgium.",

        "Abstract": "A growing number of studies apply deep neural networks (DNNs) to recordings of human electroencephalography (EEG) to identify a range of disorders. In many studies, EEG recordings are split into segments, and each segment is randomly assigned to the training or test set. As a consequence, data from individual subjects appears in both the training and the test set. Could high test-set accuracy reflect data leakage from subject-specific patterns in the data, rather than patterns that identify a disease? We address this question by testing the performance of DNN classifiers using segment-based holdout (in which segments from one subject can appear in both the training and test set), and comparing this to their performance using subject-based holdout (where all segments from one subject appear exclusively in either the training set or the test set). In two datasets (one classifying Alzheimer's disease, and the other classifying epileptic seizures), we find that performance on previously-unseen subjects is strongly overestimated when models are trained using segment-based holdout. Finally, we survey the literature and find that the majority of translational DNN-EEG studies use segment-based holdout. Most published DNN-EEG studies may dramatically overestimate their classification performance on new subjects.",

These problems are linked to fatigue, mood and cognitive performance, thereby affecting the quality of life in people with MS (PwMS). The frequent and debilitating side effects of sleep medications prompt the exploration of alternative therapies.

        "Abstract": "The recent growth of telehealth may be impacting access to care for patients, including those with limited English proficiency (LEP). Using a secret-shopper design, simulated patients contacted 386 safety-net clinics in California in both Spanish and English from February-March 2023. Callers stated that they were new patients seeking medication for depression, and they documented time to an appointment and available visit modalities (telehealth and in-person). Multinomial logistic regression models examined associations between clinic characteristics and available modalities. English-speaking callers were more likely to speak with a live scheduler and to obtain appointment information from a scheduler who could engage with them in their preferred language. Among Spanish-speaking callers who reached a live scheduler, 22% reached someone who did not engage (eg, were hung up on) and, as a result, could not obtain appointment information. The mean estimated time to a prescribing visit was 36 days and did not differ by language. Sixty-four percent of clinics offered both telehealth and in-person visits, 14% only offered in-person visits, and 22% only offered telehealth visits. More attention and resources are needed to support patients with LEP at the point of scheduling and to ensure choice of visit modality for all patient populations.",

        "Abstract": "Primary care clinics are a frequent focus of policy initiatives to improve the value of health care; yet, it is unclear whether they have the ability or incentive to take on the additional tasks that these initiatives ask of them. This paper reports on a qualitative study assessing barriers that clinic leaders face to reducing cost within a tiered cost-sharing commercial health insurance benefit design that gives both consumers and clinics a strong incentive to reduce cost. We conducted semi-structured interviews of clinical and operational leaders at a diverse set of 12 Minnesota primary care clinics and identified 6 barriers: insufficient information on drivers of cost; clinics controlling a portion of spending; patient preference for higher cost specialists; administrative challenges; limited resources; and misalignment of incentives. We discuss approaches to reducing these barriers and opportunities to implement them.",

It disproportionately affects women and those with pre-existing anxiety/depression, conditions more prevalent in females. The vagus nerve, with its extensive innervation and regulation of critical bodily functions, has become a focal point for therapeutic interventions.

        "Abstract": "People eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid coverage (\"dually eligible individuals\") have lower levels of income and assets and often higher health care needs and costs than those eligible for Medicare but not Medicaid coverage. Their 3 most common Medicare coverage options are Medicare Advantage (MA) Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs), non-D-SNP MA plans, and fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare with a stand-alone prescription drug plan. No prior study has examined clinical quality of care for dually eligible individuals across these 3 coverage types. To fill that void, we used logistic regression to compare these coverage types on 6 HEDIS measures of clinical quality of care that were available for both MA and FFS (constructed from claims files). D-SNPs and non-D-SNP MA plans significantly outperformed FFS for all 6 measures for dually eligible individuals, by approximately 5 percentage points for 2 measures and by 18-34 percentage points for the other 4 measures. For the 4 measures with the greatest advantage over FFS, performance was 3-8 percentage points higher in D-SNPs than in non-D-SNP MA plans.",

        "Abstract": "The impact of dual sequential modifications using radio-frequency (RF) plasma and electron beam irradiation (EBI) on starch properties was investigated and compared with single treatments within an irradiation dose range of 5-20\u00a0kGy. Regardless of sequence, dual treatments synergistically affected starch properties, increasing acidity, solubility, and paste clarity, while decreasing rheological features with increasing irradiation dose. The molecular weight distribution was also synergistically influenced. Amylopectin distribution broadened particularly below 10\u00a0kGy. Amylose narrowed its distribution across all irradiation doses. This was due to dominating EBI-induced degradation and molecular rearrangements from RF plasma. With the highest average radiation-chemical yield (G) and degradation rate constant (k) of (2.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010",

        "Abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a significant public health concern, with only a third of patients recovering within a year of treatment. While PTSD often disrupts the sense of body ownership and sense of agency (SA), attention to the SA in trauma has been lacking. This perspective paper explores the loss of the SA in PTSD and its relevance in the development of symptoms. Trauma is viewed as a breakdown of the SA, related to a freeze response, with peritraumatic dissociation increasing the risk of PTSD. Drawing from embodied cognition, we propose an enactive perspective of PTSD, suggesting therapies that restore the SA through direct engagement with the body and environment. We discuss the potential of agency-based therapies and innovative technologies such as gesture sonification, which translates body movements into sounds to enhance the SA. Gesture sonification offers a screen-free, noninvasive approach that could complement existing trauma-focused therapies. We emphasize the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and clinical research to further explore these approaches in preventing and treating PTSD.",

        "Abstract": "Census data are vital to health care research but must also protect respondents' confidentiality. The 2020 decennial Census employs a new Differential Privacy framework; this study examines its effect on the accuracy of an important tool for measuring health disparities, the Bayesian Improved Surname and Geocoding (BISG) algorithm, which uses Census Block Group data to estimate race and ethnicity when self-reported data are unavailable. Using self-reported race and ethnicity data as our standard, we compared the accuracy of BISG estimates calculated using the original 2010 Census counts to the accuracy of estimates calculated using 2010 data but with 2020 Differential Privacy in place. The Differential Privacy methodology slightly decreases BISG accuracy for American Indian and Alaska Native people but has little effect for other groups, suggesting that the methodology will not impede health disparities research that employs BISG and similar methods.",

        "Abstract": "To meet the scientific and political call for effective prevention of child and youth mental health problems and associated long-term consequences, we have co-created, tested, and optimized a transdiagnostic preventive parent-training intervention, Supportive parents - coping kids (SPARCK), together with and for the municipal preventive frontline services. The target group of SPARCK is parents of children between 4 and 12 years who display symptoms of anxiety, depression, and/or behavioral problems, that is, indicated prevention. The intervention consists of components from various empirically supported interventions representing different theorical models on parent-child interactions and child behavior and psychopathology (i.e., behavioral management interventions, attachment theory, emotion socialization theory, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and family accommodation intervention). The content and target strategies of SPARCK are tailored to the needs of the families and children, and the manual suggests how the target strategies may be personalized and combined throughout the maximum 12 sessions of the intervention. The aim of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of SPARCK on child symptoms, parenting practices, and parent and child stress hormone levels, in addition to later use of specialized services compared with usual care (UC; eg. active comparison group).",

        "Abstract": "Young adults experiencing homelessness (YAEH) are faced with instabilities in many areas of their lives, including their living situation, employment, and income. Little is known about how the experience of instability in these different domains might be associated with substance use. Leveraging data collected on 276 YAEH in Los Angeles County, regression analyses examine associations between three distinct types of instability (housing, employment, income) and participants' self-reported alcohol use, alcohol consequences, non-cannabis drug use, and substance use symptoms. Results indicated that recent instability in income, employment, and secure housing for those with access to it (but not housing in general or non-secure housing) were significantly associated with greater alcohol/drug use or substance use symptoms. Depression was also found to moderate the association between employment instability and alcohol use. Our findings suggest that efforts to reduce instability in income, employment, and secure housing may have positive benefits for substance using YAEH, especially those with depressive symptoms.",

Thus far, no studies reported the effects of oxylipins-containing macroalgae extracts on embryo development of marine invertebrates and on neuroblastoma cancer cells. Here, the effects of an oxylipins-containing extract from Ericaria brachycarpa, a canopy-forming brown algae, were investigated on the development of Arbacia lixula sea urchin embryos and on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells viability. Embryos and cells were exposed to concentrations covering a full 0-100% dose-response curve, with doses ranging from 0 to 40\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL",

        "Title": "The impact of resident training on robotic operative times: is there a July Effect?",
        "Abstract": "It is unknown whether the July Effect (a theory that medical errors and organizational inefficiencies increase during the influx of new surgical residents) exists in urologic robotic-assisted surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of urology resident training on robotic operative times at the beginning of the academic year. A retrospective chart review was conducted for urologic robotic surgeries performed at a single institution between 2008 and 2019. Univariate and multivariate mix model analyses were performed to determine the association between operative time and patient age, estimated blood loss, case complexity, robotic surgical system (Si or Xi), and time of the academic year. Differences in surgery time and non-surgery time were assessed with/without resident presence. Operative time intervals were included in the analysis. Resident presence correlated with increased surgery time (38.6\u00a0min (p\u2009<\u20090.001)) and decreased non-surgery time (4.6\u00a0min (p\u2009<\u20090.001)). Surgery time involving residents decreased by 8.7\u00a0min after 4\u00a0months into the academic year (July-October), and by an additional 5.1\u00a0min after the next 4\u00a0months (p\u2009=\u20090.027,\u2009<\u20090.001). When compared across case types stratified by complexity, surgery time for cases with residents significantly varied. Cases without residents did not demonstrate such variability. Resident presence was associated with prolonged surgery time, with the largest effect occurring in the first 4\u00a0months and shortening later in the year. However, resident presence was associated with significantly reduced non-surgery time. These results help to understand how new trainees impact operating room times.",

        "Abstract": "Longitudinal data from clinical trials are commonly analyzed using mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) when the time variable is categorical or linear mixed-effects models (ie, random effects model) when the time variable is continuous. In these models, statistical inference is typically based on the absolute difference in the adjusted mean change (for categorical time) or the rate of change (for continuous time). Previously, we proposed a novel approach: modeling the percentage reduction in disease progression associated with the treatment relative to the placebo decline using proportional models. This concept of proportionality provides an innovative and flexible method for simultaneously modeling different cohorts, multivariate endpoints, and jointly modeling continuous and survival endpoints. Through simulated data, we demonstrate the implementation of these models using SAS procedures in both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Additionally, we introduce a novel method for implementing MMRM models (ie, analysis of response profile) using the nlmixed procedure.",

Consensus-building is essential for engaging a diverse group of experienced knowledge users in co-developing and supporting a solution where none readily exists or is less optimal. Patients and caregivers provide invaluable insights for building consensus in decision-making around healthcare, policy and research. However, despite emerging evidence, patient engagement remains sparse within consensus-building initiatives. Specifically, our research has identified a lack of opportunity for youth living with chronic health conditions and their caregivers to participate in developing consensus on indicators/benchmarks for transition into adult care. To bridge this gap and inform our consensus-building approach with youth/caregivers, this scoping review will synthesise the extent of the literature on patient and other knowledge user engagement in consensus-building healthcare initiatives.",

        "Abstract": "This case report describes a novel therapy for patients with severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that is worth further investigation. A 19-year-old male adolescent with ASD, who was not responding to standard treatment received fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) using donor material from his typically developing female sibling. The patient's ASD symptoms were assessed by assessors who were blind to the patient's past ASD symptomatology. Assessors used the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), an observation-based rating scale to assess developmental delay in children with autism (range of CARS scores is 15 - 60; a score > 28 is indicative of autism; higher score is positively correlated with degree of severity), at baseline and again at six timepoints post-FMT. The patient experienced marked improvements in microbiome diversity and composition over the year and a half period that followed the FMT procedure. Additionally, the patient who was previously nonverbal said his first two words and experienced a reduction in aggression 1-month post-FMT. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the use of familial FMT in an adolescent patient with ASD. Given that ASD symptom improvements post-FMT tend to occur in younger patients, the authors hypothesize that the use of a familial donor may be an important factor that contributed to the improved outcomes experienced by this older child.",

        "Abstract": "Fluctuations in patient volume during the COVID-19 pandemic may have been particularly concerning for rural hospitals. We examined hospital discharge data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases to compare data from the COVID-19 pandemic period (March 8, 2020-December 31, 2021) with data from the prepandemic period (January 1, 2017-March 7, 2020). Changes in average daily medical volume at rural hospitals showed a dose-response relationship with community COVID-19 burden, ranging from a 13.2\u00a0percent decrease in patient volume in periods of low transmission to a 16.5\u00a0percent increase in volume in periods of high transmission. Overall, about 35\u00a0percent of rural hospitals experienced fluctuations exceeding 20\u00a0percent (in either direction) in average daily total volume, in contrast to only 13\u00a0percent of urban hospitals experiencing similar magnitudes of changes. Rural hospitals with a large change in average daily volume were more likely to be smaller, government-owned, and critical access hospitals and to have significantly lower operating margins. Our findings suggest that rural hospitals may have been more vulnerable operationally and financially to volume shifts during the pandemic, which warrants attention because of the potential impact on these hospitals' long-term sustainability.",

        "Abstract": "B7-H3 (CD276) is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the B7 immune checkpoint superfamily that has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. To better understand the applicability of B7-H3-directed therapies, we analyzed 156,791 samples comprising 50 cancer types to interrogate the clinical, genomic, transcriptomic, and immunologic correlates of B7-H3 mRNA expression. DNA (592-gene/whole-exome) and RNA (whole-transcriptome) sequencing was performed from samples submitted to Caris Life Sciences. B7-H3 high versus low expression was based on top and bottom quartiles for each cancer type. Patients' overall survival was determined from insurance claims data. Pathway analysis was performed using gene set enrichment analyses. Immune cell fractions were inferred using quanTIseq. B7-H3 is expressed across several human malignancies including prostate, pancreatic, ovarian, and lung cancers. High B7-H3 expression is associated with differences in overall survival, possibly indicating a prognostic role of B7-H3 for some cancers. When examining molecular features across all cancer types, we did not identify recurrent associations between B7-H3 expression and genetic alterations in TP53, RB1, and KRAS. However, we find consistent enrichment of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, Wnt, TGF\u03b2, and Notch signaling pathways. In addition, tumors with high B7-H3 expression are associated with greater proportions of M1 macrophages, but lower fractions of CD8+ T cells. We have begun to define the genomic, transcriptomic, clinical, and immunologic features associated with B7-H3 expression in 50 cancer types. We report novel clinical and molecular features of B7-H3-high tumors which may inform how current B7-H3 therapeutics should be deployed and prioritized.",

        "Abstract": "Ongoing assessment of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in postapproval studies is important for mapping disease progression and evaluating real-world treatment effectiveness and safety. However, interpreting outcomes in the real world is challenging owing to variation in data collected across centers and specialties and greater heterogeneity of patients compared with trial participants. Here, we share considerations for observational postapproval studies designed to collect harmonized longitudinal data from individuals with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease who receive therapies targeting the underlying pathological processes of AD in routine practice. This paper considers key study design parameters, including proposed aims and objectives, study populations, approaches to data collection, and measures of cognition, functional abilities, neuropsychiatric status, quality of life, health economics, safety, and drug utilization. Postapproval studies that capture these considerations will be important to provide standardized data on AD treatment effectiveness and safety in real-world settings.",

        "Abstract": "Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) can provide valuable information about a biological sample by giving information on the specific localization of a molecule of interest within an ultrastructural context. In this work, we describe a simple CLEM method to obtain high-resolution images of neurotransmitter receptor distribution in synapses by electron microscopy (EM). We use hippocampal organotypic slices from a previously reported mouse model expressing a modified AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit that binds biotin at the surface (Getz et al., 2022). This tag can be recognized by StreptAvidin-Fluoronanogold\u2122 conjugates (SA-FNG), which reach receptors at synapses (synaptic cleft is 50-100nm thick). By using pre-embedding labeling, we found that SA-FNG reliably bind synaptic receptors and penetrate around 10-15\u03bcm in depth in live tissue. However, the silver enhancement was only reaching the surface of the slices. We show that permeabilization with triton is highly effective at increasing the in depth-gold amplification and that the membrane integrity is well preserved. Finally, we also apply high-resolution electron tomography, thus providing important information about the 3D organization of surface AMPA receptors in synapses at the nanoscale.",

        "Abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a human gene therapy product where T cells from a patient are genetically modified to enable them to recognize desired target antigen(s) more effectively. In recent years, promising antitumor activity has been seen with autologous CAR T cells. Since 2017, six CAR T-cell therapies for the treatment of hematological malignancies have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Despite the rapid progress of CAR T-cell therapies, considerable statistical challenges still exist for this category of products across all phases of clinical development that need to be addressed. These include (but not limited to) dose finding strategy, implementation of the estimand framework, use of real-world data in contextualizing single-arm CAR T trials, analysis of safety data and long-term follow-up studies. This paper is the first step in summarizing and addressing these statistical hurdles based on the development of the six approved CAR T-cell products.",

        "Abstract": "Urbanization presents a natural evolutionary experiment because selection pressures in cities can be strongly mismatched with those found in species' historic habitats. However, some species have managed to adapt and even thrive in these novel conditions. When a species persists across multiple cities, a fundamental question arises: do we see similar traits evolve in similar novel environments? By testing if and how similar phenotypes emerge across multiple urban populations, we can begin to assess the predictability of population response to anthropogenic change. Here, we examine variation within and across multiple populations of a songbird, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). We measured morphological variations in juncos across urban and nonurban populations in Southern California. We investigated whether the variations we observed were due to differences in environmental conditions across cities. Bill shape differed across urban populations; Los Angeles and Santa Barbara juncos had shorter, deeper bills than nonurban juncos, but San Diego juncos did not. On the other hand, wing length decreased with the built environment, regardless of the population. Southern Californian urban juncos exhibit both similarities and differences in morphological traits. Studying multiple urban populations can help us determine the predictability of phenotypic evolutionary responses to novel environments.",

This study addresses a gap in the minority identity literature by investigating how urban AI/AN emerging adults think about their identity and discussing challenges and protective factors associated with exploring their identity holistically. This mixed-methods study created a sampling framework based on discrimination experiences, cultural identity, social network support, mental health, and problematic substance use. We recruited 20 urban AI/AN emerging adults for interviews. We sought to gain deeper insights into their experiences and discussions surrounding identity formation and exploration. We provide descriptives for demographic characteristics and conducted a thematic analysis of the qualitative data from the interviews. Four themes emerged: a) being an urban AI/AN emerging adult means recognizing that one's identity is multifaceted; b) a multifaceted identity comes with tension of living in multiple worlds; c) the trajectory of one's identity grows over time to a deeper desire to connect with Native American culture; and d) understanding one's Native American background affects one's professional trajectory. Findings underscore the importance of developing programs to support well-being and identity development through cultural connection for urban AI/AN emerging adults.",

        "Abstract": "Large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapy represents a novel treatment with curative potential for relapsed or refractory (R/R) LBCL, but there are access barriers to this innovative therapy that are not well-studied. Study objectives were: (1) Assess the impact of geographic factors and social determinants of health (SDOH) on access to treatment with CAR T in a sample of patients with R/R LBCL and \u22652 prior lines of therapy (LOT). (2) Compare and contrast patient characteristics, SDOH, and travel time between patients with R/R LBCL who received CAR T and those who did not. An observational, nested case-control study of patients with R/R LBCL, \u22652 prior LOT, not in a clinical trial, identified using 100% Medicare Fee-For-Service and national multi-payer claims databases. Patients were linked to near-neighborhood SDOH using 9-digit ZIP-code address. Driving distance and time between residence and nearest CAR T treatment center (TC) was calculated. Patients were stratified based on treatments received upon third LOT initiation (Index Date) or later: (1) received CAR T and (2) did not receive CAR T. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with CAR T. 5011 patients met inclusion criteria, with 628 (12.5%) in the CAR T group. Regression models found the likelihood of receiving CAR T decreased with patient age (odds ratio [OR] = .96, P < .001), and males were 29% more likely to receive CAR T (OR = 1.29, P = .02). Likelihood of CAR T increased with Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI; OR = 1.07, P < .001) indicating patients with more comorbidities were more likely to receive CAR T. Black patients were less than half as likely to receive CAR T than White patients (OR = .44, P = .01). Asian patients did not significantly differ from White patients (OR = 1.43, P = .24), and there was a trend for Hispanic patients to have a slightly lower likelihood of CAR T (OR = .50, P = .07). Higher household income was associated with receipt of CAR T, with the lowest income group more than 50% less likely to receive CAR T than the highest (OR = .44, P = .002), and the second lowest income group more than 30% less likely (OR = .68, P = .02). Finally, likelihood of CAR T therapy was reduced when the driving time to the nearest TC was 121 to 240 minutes (reference group: \u226430 minutes; OR = .64, P = .04). Travel times between 31 and 121 or greater than 240 minutes were not significantly different from \u226430 minutes. Payer type was collinear with age and could not be included in the regression analysis, but patients with commercial insurance were 1.5 to 3 times more likely to receive CAR T than other payers on an unadjusted basis. We identified significant disparities in access to CAR T related to demographics and SDOH. Patients who were older, female, low income, or Black were less likely to receive CAR T. The positive association of CCI with CAR T requires further research. Given the promising outcomes of CAR T, there is urgent need to address identified disparities and increase efforts to overcome access barriers.",

        "Abstract": "The nexus of advanced technology and medical therapeutics has ushered in a transformative epoch in contemporary medicine. Within this arena, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) emerges as a paramount tool, intertwining the advancements of technology with the art of healing. MRI's pivotal role is evident in its broad applicability, spanning from neurological diseases, soft-tissue and tumour characterization, to many more applications. Though already foundational, aspirations remain to further enhance MRI's capabilities. A significant avenue under exploration is the incorporation of innovative nanotechnological contrast agents. Forefront among these are Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs), recognized for their adaptability and safety profile. SPION's intrinsic malleability allows them to be tailored for improved biocompatibility, while their functionality is further broadened when equipped with specific targeting molecules. Yet, the path to optimization is not devoid of challenges, from renal clearance concerns to potential side effects stemming from iron overload. This review endeavors to map the intricate journey of SPIONs as MRI contrast agents, offering a chronological perspective of their evolution and deployment. We provide an in-depth current outline of the most representative and impactful pre-clinical and clinical studies centered on the integration of SPIONs in MRI, tracing their trajectory from foundational research to contemporary applications.",

In this cross-sectional study, we identified all births during the study period carrying the radiology-confirmed diagnosis of fibroid uterus in pregnancy (defined as size of largest diameter of >5\u00a0cm) by using an NLP platform and compared it to non-NLP derived data using ICD10 codes of the same diagnosis. We then compared the two sets of data and stratified documentation gaps by race. Using fibroid uterus in pregnancy as a marker, we found that Black patients were more likely to have the diagnosis entered late into the patient's chart or had missing documentation of the diagnosis. With appropriate algorithm definitions, cross referencing and thorough validation steps, NLP can contribute to identifying areas of documentation gaps and improve quality of care.",

        "Abstract": "The urgent need for transition to renewable energy is underscored by a nearly 50\u00a0% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels over the past century. The combustion of fossil fuels for energy production, transportation, and industrial activities are the main contributors to carbon dioxide emissions in the anthroposphere. Present approaches to reducing carbon emissions are proving inefficient, thereby accentuating the relevance of carbon dioxide photocatalysis in combating climate change - one of the critical issues of public concern. This process uses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into valuable products, e.g., clean fuels, effectively reducing the carbon footprint and offering a sustainable use of carbon dioxide. In this context, plasmonic nanoparticles such as gold, silver, and copper play a pivotal role due to their proficiency in absorbing a wide range of light spectra, thereby effectively generating the necessary electrons and holes for the degradation of pollutants and surpassing the capabilities of traditional semiconductor catalysts. This review meticulously examines the latest advancements in plasmon-based carbon dioxide photocatalysis, scrutinizing the methodologies, characterizations, and experimental outcomes. The critical evaluation extends to exploring adjustments in the dimensional and morphological aspects of plasmonic nanoparticles, complemented by the incorporation of stabilizing agents, which may offer additional benefits. Furthermore, the review includes a thorough analysis of production rates and quantum yields based on different plasmonic materials and nanoparticle shapes and sizes, enriching the ongoing discourse on effective solutions in the field. Thus, our work emphasizes the pivotal role of plasmon-based photocatalysts in reducing carbon dioxide, investigating both the merits and challenges associated with integrating this emerging technology into climate change mitigation efforts.",

        "Abstract": "Hydraulic losses are a crucial variable in hydroelectric ventures as they can cause significant reductions in power generation. This article analyses the impact of hydraulic losses on the Retiro Small Hydroelectric Power Plant (SHPP), investigating their effect on monthly average power and, consequently, the efficiency of electricity generation. This study examines the historical series of load losses at the Retiro SHPP from 1990 to 2022. The calculations are based on flow data available in HidroWeb. The study considered the maximum and minimum flow rates in the historical flow series as constraints for hydropower generation. We used a multivariable function to calculate the efficiency of the hydraulic turbine, relating the turbine flow rate and the net water head. We developed mathematical relationships for head losses that occur in the grid, at the water intake, and due to friction from the intake to the turbine of the Retiro SHPP. The article presents a comparison between the actual monthly average power of the Small Hydroelectric Power Plant (SHPP) and the simulated monthly average power. We normalized the data for turbine flow and load loss to conduct statistical analysis. Kernel probability density was applied to understand the distribution shape of the data. Findings show that average monthly capacity is lowest in September, at approximately 0.81\u00a0MW. In March, the highest power occurs, approximately 14.19\u00a0MW. During the high flow period, the simulated average power, which accounts for load losses, closely matched the actual average power generated at the Retiro SHPP. In the months from July to October, despite being the period with the lowest head losses, it is the time when there is a greater opportunity to maximize energy generation at the power plant. An inefficient power generation system experiences significant load losses during specific periods of the year. To minimize this effect, it is crucial to understand the behavior of hydraulic losses and consider implementing mitigating measures.",

        "Title": "Pembrolizumab-induced nephrotoxicity in a patient with breast cancer.",
        "Abstract": "The introduction of immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment and improved outcomes of multiple types of cancer. Although breast cancer is a less immune-responsive tumor type, the incorporation of pembrolizumab into chemotherapy regimens in the neoadjuvant and first-line metastatic setting for the triple-negative disease has improved outcomes. However, the use of this type of treatment is associated with a spectrum of adverse events. Although rarely affected, kidneys can be a target for immunotherapy, leading to irreversible injury if not recognized and addressed early. A 52-year-old woman presented with clinical stage II right breast cancer diagnosed at an outside facility. Neoadjuvant docetaxel/carboplatin/pembrolizumab every 3\u2009weeks was started. Given the partial response on MRI after the 4th cycle, treatment was switched to doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide. However, pembrolizumab was held in cycle 2 due to the rash and then resumed in cycle 3 after the resolution of symptoms. Elevated creatinine was noted 3\u2009weeks after the last dose of pembrolizumab without improvement despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Diagnostic workup was unremarkable except for pyuria and minimal albuminuria on urinalysis. In the absence of other risk factors and the temporal relationship between pembrolizumab administration and the onset of acute kidney injury (AKI), immune-related nephrotoxicity was the underlying diagnosis. After initiation of corticosteroids, creatinine decreased back to baseline without the need for kidney biopsy. An addendum to the original pathology report from the outside facility surfaced 5\u2009months after starting treatment, revealing that the second breast lesion had a Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test performed that was positive. Given this fact, therapy was changed to two cycles of neoadjuvant paclitaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab/pertuzumab, with approximately 8\u2009weeks between the last pembrolizumab dose and the first dose of trastuzumab. Thereafter, she underwent a right breast mastectomy which showed residual invasive carcinoma with negative margins and lymph nodes. She completed 1\u2009year of trastuzumab. Immune-related AKI is a rare, but potentially serious complication associated with an increase in mortality. Further research is needed in the development and early detection. There is promising research in the development of noninvasive biomarkers which has the added benefit of identifying patients who can be re-challenged with immunotherapy.",

In the present study, we analysed 1800 subjects with neurodevelopmental disorders using a CGH microarray. We identified 208 (7%) pathogenetic CNVs, 2202 (78%) variants of uncertain significance (VOUS), and 504 (18%) benign CNVs in the 1800 patients analysed.

        "Abstract": "Hospitalization presents an opportunity to begin people with opioid use disorder (OUD) on medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and link them to care after discharge; regrettably, people admitted to the hospital with an underlying OUD typically do not receive MOUD and are not connected with subsequent treatment for their condition. To address this gap, we launched a multi-site randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a hospital-based addiction consultation team (the Substance Use Treatment and Recovery Team (START)) consisting of an addiction medicine specialist and care manager team that provide collaborative care and a specified intervention to people with OUD during the inpatient stay. Successful implementation of new practices can be impacted by organizational context, though no previous studies have examined context prior to implementation of addiction consultation services (ACS). This study assessed pre-implementation context for implementing a specialized ACS and tailoring it accordingly.",

Intimate partner violence (IPV), substance use, and depression are associated with HIV risk behavior such as condomless sex.

We then evaluated the mediating roles of mental health and substance use, in a sample of 213 Black SMM living with HIV. We used validated scales to assess IPV victimization, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, general mental health, and substance use.

        "Title": "Sudden unexpected postnatal collapse and BUB1B mutation: first forensic case report.",
        "Abstract": "Sudden unexpected postnatal collapse (SUPC) is a sudden collapse of the clinical conditions of a full-term or near-term newborn, within the first 7 days of life, that requires resuscitation with positive ventilation and who either dies, has hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, or requires intensive care. The incidence of SUPC is very low, and most often presents a negative prognosis. The BUB1B gene is a mitotic checkpoint of serine/threonine kinase B that encodes a protein crucial for maintaining the correct number of chromosomes during cell division. Mutations in the BUB1B gene are linked to mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome 1 (MVA1), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by diffuse mosaic aneuploidies involving several chromosomes and tissues. This paper discusses a case of a newborn who had a spontaneous delivery. After 2\u00a0h and 10\u00a0min, the infant showed generalized hypotonia and cyanosis, and his doctors performed orotracheal intubation, cardiac massage, pharmacological hemodynamic therapy, mechanical ventilation, antibiotic therapy, and hypothermic treatment. The newborn was discharged after 5 months with the diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Suspecting an SUPC, a complete genetic analysis was performed demonstrating a compound heterozygous mutations in the BUB1B gene. The newborn died at 6 months of life, 1 month after discharge. A complete autopsy was performed, determining that the cause of death was due to sepsis starting from a brocopneumonic process, with outcomes of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). In this scenario, it is not possible to demonstrate the causal effect of this mutation, considering that it could play a causal or concausal role in the onset of SUPC. Further research based on multicenter studies, as well as on animal models, could be very useful to clarify the pathological effect of this mutation.",

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent fatal neoplasias worldwide. Despite efforts to improve the early diagnosis of CRC, the mortality rate of patients is still nearly 50%. The primary treatment strategy for CRC is surgery, which may be accompanied by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The conventional and first-line chemotherapeutic agent utilized is 5-fluorouracil (5FU). However, it has low efficiency. Combination treatment with leucovorin and oxaliplatin or irinotecan improves the effectiveness of 5FU therapy. Unfortunately, most patients develop drug resistance, leading to disease progression. Here, we evaluated the effect of a potential alternative adjuvant treatment for 5FU, helminth-derived Taenia crassiceps (TcES) molecules, on treating advanced colitis-associated colon cancer. The use of TcES enhanced the effects of 5FU on established colonic tumors by downregulating the expression of the immunoregulatory cytokines, Il-10 and Tgf-\u03b2, and proinflammatory cytokines, Tnf-\u03b1 and Il-17a, and reducing the levels of molecular markers associated with malignancy, cyclin D1, and Ki67, both involved in apoptosis inhibition and the signaling pathway of \u03b2-catenin. TcES+5FU therapy promoted NK cell recruitment and the release of Granzyme B1 at the tumor site, consequently inducing tumor cell death. Additionally, it restored P53 activity which relates to decreased Mdm2 expression. In vitro assays with human colon cancer cell lines showed that therapy with TcES+5FU significantly reduced cell proliferation and migration by modulating the P53 and P21 signaling pathways. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time in vivo, that helminth-derived excreted/secreted products may potentiate the effect of 5FU on established colon tumors.",

        "Abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR T) has revolutionized the treatment of hematological cancers. Its production requires a complex logistical process, and the time from leukapheresis to patient infusion (known as the vein-to-vein time [V2VT]) can be long during which a patients clinical condition may deteriorate. This study was designed to estimate the benefits of reduced V2VT for third-line or later (3L+) relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (R/R\u00a0LBCL) patients treated with CAR T. A mathematical model was developed to estimate the lifetime outcomes of a hypothetical cohort of patients who had either a long or short V2VT. Life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and costs were estimated. Scenario analyses were performed to assess the robustness of results to key assumptions. The results of the model show that reducing V2VT from 54\u00a0days (tisa-cel median V2VT; JULIET) to 24\u00a0days (axi-cel median V2VT; ZUMA-1) led to a 3.2-year gain in life expectancy (4.2 vs 7.7 LYs), and 2.4 additional QALYs (3.2 vs 5.6) per patient. Furthermore, a shorter V2VT was shown to be cost-effective under conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds in the United States. Results are driven by a higher infusion rate and a better efficacy of CAR T for those infused. Scenario analyses using a smaller difference in V2VT (24 vs 36\u00a0days) produced consistent results. Our study is the first to quantify lifetime V2VT-related outcomes for 3L+ R/R LBCL patients treated with CAR T utilizing currently available evidence. Shorter V2VTs led to improved outcomes, demonstrating the importance of timely infusion achievable by faster manufacturing times and optimization of hospital delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Several second- and third-line immunotherapeutic options for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant are directed against the B-cell antigen cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19). The anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody tafasitamab, paired with the immunomodulator lenalidomide, mediates antibody-dependent cellular toxicity and phagocytosis; the antibody-drug conjugate loncastuximab tesirine delivers the DNA cross-linking agent tesirine via CD19 binding and internalization; and CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) products are engineered from autologous T cells. Although CD19 expression is assessed at diagnosis, clinically relevant thresholds of CD19 expression-which may not be detectable using current routine methodologies-have not been defined and may vary between CD19-directed treatment modalities. Determining optimal treatment sequencing strategies for CD19-directed therapy is hampered by the exclusion of patients who have received prior CD19-directed therapies from major clinical trials. Antigen escape, which is attributed to mechanisms including epitope loss and defective cell surface trafficking of CD19, is an important cause of CAR-T failure. Limited data suggest that CD19 expression may be maintained after non-CAR-T CD19-directed therapy, and retrospective analyses indicate that some patients with disease relapse after CAR-T may benefit from subsequent CD19-directed therapy. To date, clinical evidence on the effect of anti-CD19 therapy prior to CAR-T has been limited to small case series. Prospective studies and detailed analyses are needed to understand how pretreatment and posttreatment CD19 expression correlates with clinical responses to subsequent CD19-directed therapy to fully maximize treatment strategies.",

We used data from a 5-year (2018-2022) worldwide (84 countries) program to identify brands found on plastic items in the environment through 1576 audit events. We found that 50% of items were unbranded, calling for mandated producer reporting. The top five brands globally were The Coca-Cola Company (11%), PepsiCo (5%), Nestl\u00e9 (3%), Danone (3%), and Altria (2%), accounting for 24% of the total branded count, and 56 companies accounted for more than 50%. There was a clear and strong log-log linear relationship production (%) = pollution (%) between companies' annual production of plastic and their branded plastic pollution, with food and beverage companies being disproportionately large polluters. Phasing out single-use and short-lived plastic products by the largest polluters would greatly reduce global plastic pollution.",

Return to sports and certainly the level of sport post-MAT are highly variable. We present a unique case of a national judo champion who was able to compete at the highest level following MAT. Considerations regarding the rehabilitation and follow-up of this patient are provided, and the risk of rerupture is discussed. Although returning to high-level contact sports post-MAT is possible, the risk of rerupture should be considered.",

        "Abstract": "Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are complex, and rare arteriovenous shunts that present with a wide range of signs and symptoms, with intracerebral hemorrhage being the most severe. Despite prior societal position statements, there is no consensus on the management of these lesions. ARISE (Aneurysm/bAVM/cSDH Roundtable Discussion With Industry and Stroke Experts) was convened to discuss evidence-based approaches and enhance our understanding of these complex lesions. ARISE identified the need to develop scales to predict the risk of rupture of bAVMs, and the use of common data elements to perform prospective registries and clinical studies. Additionally, the group underscored the need for comprehensive patient management with specialized centers with expertise in cranial and spinal microsurgery, neurological endovascular surgery, and stereotactic radiosurgery. The collection of prospective multicenter data and gross specimens was deemed essential for improving bAVM characterization, genetic evaluation, and phenotyping. Finally, bAVMs should be managed within a multidisciplinary framework, with clinical studies and research conducted collaboratively across multiple centers, harnessing the collective expertise and centralization of resources.",
