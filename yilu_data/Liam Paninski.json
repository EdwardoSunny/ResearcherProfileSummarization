        "Title": "Towards a \"universal translator\" for neural dynamics at single-cell, single-spike resolution.",
        "Abstract": "Neuroscience research has made immense progress over the last decade, but our understanding of the brain remains fragmented and piecemeal: the dream of probing an arbitrary brain region and automatically reading out the information encoded in its neural activity remains out of reach. In this work, we build towards a first foundation model for neural spiking data that can solve a diverse set of tasks across multiple brain areas. We introduce a novel self-supervised modeling approach for population activity in which the model alternates between masking out and reconstructing neural activity across different time steps, neurons, and brain regions. To evaluate our approach, we design unsupervised and supervised prediction tasks using the International Brain Laboratory repeated site dataset, which is comprised of Neuropixels recordings targeting the same brain locations across 48 animals and experimental sessions. The prediction tasks include single-neuron and region-level activity prediction, forward prediction, and behavior decoding. We demonstrate that our multi-task-masking (MtM) approach significantly improves the performance of current state-of-the-art population models and enables multi-task learning. We also show that by training on multiple animals, we can improve the generalization ability of the model to unseen animals, paving the way for a foundation model of the brain at single-cell, single-spike resolution.",

        "Abstract": "Action segmentation of behavioral videos is the process of labeling each frame as belonging to one or more discrete classes, and is a crucial component of many studies that investigate animal behavior. A wide range of algorithms exist to automatically parse discrete animal behavior, encompassing supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning paradigms. These algorithms -- which include tree-based models, deep neural networks, and graphical models -- differ widely in their structure and assumptions on the data. Using four datasets spanning multiple species -- fly, mouse, and human -- we systematically study how the outputs of these various algorithms align with manually annotated behaviors of interest. Along the way, we introduce a semi-supervised action segmentation model that bridges the gap between supervised deep neural networks and unsupervised graphical models. We find that fully supervised temporal convolutional networks with the addition of temporal information in the observations perform the best on our supervised metrics across all datasets.",

        "Abstract": "Contemporary pose estimation methods enable precise measurements of behavior via supervised deep learning with hand-labeled video frames. Although effective in many cases, the supervised approach requires extensive labeling and often produces outputs that are unreliable for downstream analyses. Here, we introduce 'Lightning Pose', an efficient pose estimation package with three algorithmic contributions. First, in addition to training on a few labeled video frames, we use many unlabeled videos and penalize the network whenever its predictions violate motion continuity, multiple-view geometry and posture plausibility (semi-supervised learning). Second, we introduce a network architecture that resolves occlusions by predicting pose on any given frame using surrounding unlabeled frames. Third, we refine the pose predictions post hoc by combining ensembling and Kalman smoothing. Together, these components render pose trajectories more accurate and scientifically usable. We released a cloud application that allows users to label data, train networks and process new videos directly from the browser.",

        "Abstract": "Tracking body parts in behaving animals, extracting fluorescence signals from cells embedded in deforming tissue, and analyzing cell migration patterns during development all require tracking objects with partially correlated motion. As dataset sizes increase, manual tracking of objects becomes prohibitively inefficient and slow, necessitating automated and semi-automated computational tools. Unfortunately, existing methods for multiple object tracking (MOT) are either developed for specific datasets and hence do not generalize well to other datasets, or require large amounts of training data that are not readily available. This is further exacerbated when tracking fluorescent sources in moving and deforming tissues, where the lack of unique features and sparsely populated images create a challenging environment, especially for modern deep learning techniques. By leveraging technology recently developed for spatial transformer networks, we propose ZephIR, an image registration framework for semi-supervised MOT in 2D and 3D videos. ZephIR can generalize to a wide range of biological systems by incorporating adjustable parameters that encode spatial (sparsity, texture, rigidity) and temporal priors of a given data class. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of our approach in a variety of applications, including tracking the body parts of a behaving mouse and neurons in the brain of a freely moving C. elegans. We provide an open-source package along with a web-based graphical user interface that allows users to provide small numbers of annotations to interactively improve tracking results.",

However, when the postsynaptic cell expresses opsin, optical excitation of nearby cells can induce direct photocurrents in the postsynaptic cell. These photocurrent artifacts contaminate synaptic currents, making it difficult or impossible to probe connectivity for nearby cells. To overcome this problem, we developed a computational tool, Photocurrent Removal with Constraints (PhoRC). Our method is based on a constrained matrix factorization model which leverages the fact that photocurrent kinetics are less variable than those of synaptic currents. We demonstrate on real and simulated data that PhoRC consistently removes photocurrents while preserving synaptic currents, despite variations in photocurrent kinetics across datasets. Our method allows the discovery of synaptic connections which would have been otherwise obscured by photocurrent artifacts, and may thus reveal a more complete picture of synaptic connectivity. PhoRC runs faster than real time and is available as open source software.",

        "Abstract": "In many neural populations, the computationally relevant signals are posited to be a set of 'latent factors' - signals shared across many individual neurons. Understanding the relationship between neural activity and behavior requires the identification of factors that reflect distinct computational roles. Methods for identifying such factors typically require supervision, which can be suboptimal if one is unsure how (or whether) factors can be grouped into distinct, meaningful sets. Here, we introduce Sparse Component Analysis (SCA), an unsupervised method that identifies interpretable latent factors. SCA seeks factors that are sparse in time and occupy orthogonal dimensions. With these simple constraints, SCA facilitates surprisingly clear parcellations of neural activity across a range of behaviors. We applied SCA to motor cortex activity from reaching and cycling monkeys, single-trial imaging data from ",

        "Abstract": "High-density microelectrode arrays (MEAs) have opened new possibilities for systems neuroscience in human and non-human animals, but brain tissue motion relative to the array poses a challenge for downstream analyses, particularly in human recordings. We introduce DREDge (Decentralized Registration of Electrophysiology Data), a robust algorithm which is well suited for the registration of noisy, nonstationary extracellular electrophysiology recordings. In addition to estimating motion from spikes in the action potential (AP) frequency band, DREDge enables automated tracking of motion at high temporal resolution in the local field potential (LFP) frequency band. In human intraoperative recordings, which often feature fast (period <1s) motion, DREDge correction in the LFP band enabled reliable recovery of evoked potentials, and significantly reduced single-unit spike shape variability and spike sorting error. Applying DREDge to recordings made during deep probe insertions in nonhuman primates demonstrated the possibility of tracking probe motion of centimeters across several brain regions while simultaneously mapping single unit electrophysiological features. DREDge reliably delivered improved motion correction in acute mouse recordings, especially in those made with an recent ultra-high density probe. We also implemented a procedure for applying DREDge to recordings made across tens of days in chronic implantations in mice, reliably yielding stable motion tracking despite changes in neural activity across experimental sessions. Together, these advances enable automated, scalable registration of electrophysiological data across multiple species, probe types, and drift cases, providing a stable foundation for downstream scientific analyses of these rich datasets.",

        "Title": "maskNMF: A denoise-sparsen-detect approach for extracting neural signals from dense imaging data.",
        "Abstract": "A number of calcium imaging methods have been developed to monitor the activity of large populations of neurons. One particularly promising approach, Bessel imaging, captures neural activity from a volume by projecting within the imaged volume onto a single imaging plane, therefore effectively mixing signals and increasing the number of neurons imaged per pixel. These signals must then be computationally demixed to recover the desired neural activity. Unfortunately, currently-available demixing methods can perform poorly in the regime of high imaging density (i.e., many neurons per pixel). In this work we introduce a new pipeline (maskNMF) for demixing dense calcium imaging data. The main idea is to first denoise and temporally sparsen the observed video; this enhances signal strength and reduces spatial overlap significantly. Next we detect neurons in the sparsened video using a neural network trained on a library of neural shapes. These shapes are derived from segmented electron microscopy images input into a Bessel imaging model; therefore no manual selection of \"good\" neural shapes from the functional data is required here. After cells are detected, we use a constrained non-negative matrix factorization approach to demix the activity, using the detected cells' shapes to initialize the factorization. We test the resulting pipeline on both simulated and real datasets and find that it is able to achieve accurate demixing on denser data than was previously feasible, therefore enabling faithful imaging of larger neural populations. The method also provides good results on more \"standard\" two-photon imaging data. Finally, because much of the pipeline operates on a significantly compressed version of the raw data and is highly parallelizable, the algorithm is fast, processing large datasets faster than real time.",

        "Abstract": "What are the spatial and temporal scales of brainwide neuronal activity? We used swept, confocally-aligned planar excitation (SCAPE) microscopy to image all cells in a large volume of the brain of adult Drosophila with high spatiotemporal resolution while flies engaged in a variety of spontaneous behaviors. This revealed neural representations of behavior on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The activity of most neurons correlated (or anticorrelated) with running and flailing over timescales that ranged from seconds to a minute. Grooming elicited a weaker global response. Significant residual activity not directly correlated with behavior was high dimensional and reflected the activity of small clusters of spatially organized neurons that may correspond to genetically defined cell types. These clusters participate in the global dynamics, indicating that neural activity reflects a combination of local and broadly distributed components. This suggests that microcircuits with highly specified functions are provided with knowledge of the larger context in which they operate.",

The main obstacle is to align the different imaging modalities to obtain complementary information about the observed cell population (e.g., gene expression and calcium signal). Traditional image registration methods perform poorly when only a small subset of cells are present in both images, as is common in multimodal experiments. We cast multimodal microscopy alignment as a cell subset matching problem. To solve this non-convex problem, we introduce an ",

However, achieving precise optogenetic control of neural ensemble activity has remained fundamentally constrained by the problem of off-target stimulation (OTS): the inadvertent activation of nearby non-target neurons due to imperfect confinement of light onto target neurons. Here we propose a novel computational approach to this problem called Bayesian target optimisation. Our approach uses nonparametric Bayesian inference to model neural responses to optogenetic stimulation, and then optimises the laser powers and optical target locations needed to achieve a desired activity pattern with minimal OTS. We validate our approach in simulations and using data from ",

Although effective in many cases, the supervised approach requires extensive labeling and often produces outputs that are unreliable for downstream analyses. Here, we introduce \"Lightning Pose,\" an efficient pose estimation package with three algorithmic contributions. First, in addition to training on a few labeled video frames, we use many unlabeled videos and penalize the network whenever its predictions violate motion continuity, multiple-view geometry, and posture plausibility (semi-supervised learning). Second, we introduce a network architecture that resolves occlusions by predicting pose on any given frame using surrounding unlabeled frames. Third, we refine the pose predictions post-hoc by combining ensembling and Kalman smoothing. Together, these components render pose trajectories more accurate and scientifically usable. We release a cloud application that allows users to label data, train networks, and predict new videos directly from the browser.",

        "Abstract": "A key aspect of neuroscience research is the development of powerful, general-purpose data analyses that process large datasets. Unfortunately, modern data analyses have a hidden dependence upon complex computing infrastructure (e.g., software and hardware), which acts as an unaddressed deterrent to analysis users. Although existing analyses are increasingly shared as open-source software, the infrastructure and knowledge needed to deploy these analyses efficiently still pose significant barriers to use. In this work, we develop Neuroscience Cloud Analysis As a Service (NeuroCAAS): a fully automated open-source analysis platform offering automatic infrastructure reproducibility for any data analysis. We show how NeuroCAAS supports the design of simpler, more powerful data analyses and that many popular data analysis tools offered through NeuroCAAS outperform counterparts on typical infrastructure. Pairing rigorous infrastructure management with cloud resources, NeuroCAAS dramatically accelerates the dissemination and use of new data analyses for neuroscientific discovery.",

        "Abstract": "Cellular barcoding methods offer the exciting possibility of 'infinite-pseudocolor' anatomical reconstruction-i.e., assigning each neuron its own random unique barcoded 'pseudocolor,' and then using these pseudocolors to trace the microanatomy of each neuron. Here we use simulations, based on densely-reconstructed electron microscopy microanatomy, with signal structure matched to real barcoding data, to quantify the feasibility of this procedure. We develop a new blind demixing approach to recover the barcodes that label each neuron, and validate this method on real data with known barcodes. We also develop a neural network which uses the recovered barcodes to reconstruct the neuronal morphology from the observed fluorescence imaging data, 'connecting the dots' between discontiguous barcode amplicon signals. We find that accurate recovery should be feasible, provided that the barcode signal density is sufficiently high. This study suggests the possibility of mapping the morphology and projection pattern of many individual neurons simultaneously, at high resolution and at large scale, via conventional light microscopy.",

        "Abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics techniques such as STARmap [15] enable the subcellular detection of RNA transcripts within complex tissue sections. The data from these techniques are impacted by optical microscopy limitations, such as shading or vignetting effects from uneven illumination during image capture. Downstream analysis of these sparse spatially resolved transcripts is dependent upon the correction of these artefacts. This paper introduces a novel non-parametric vignetting correction tool for spatial transcriptomic images, which estimates the illumination field and background using an efficient iterative sliced histogram normalization routine. We show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art shading correction techniques both in terms of illumination and background field estimation and requires fewer input images to perform the estimation adequately. We further demonstrate an important downstream application of our technique, showing that spatial transcriptomic volumes corrected by our method yield a higher and more uniform gene expression spot-calling in the rodent hippocampus. Python code and a demo file to reproduce our results are provided in the supplementary material and at this github page: https://github.com/BoveyRao/Non-parametric-vc-for-sparse-st.",

        "Abstract": "Recent neuroscience studies demonstrate that a deeper understanding of brain function requires a deeper understanding of behavior. Detailed behavioral measurements are now often collected using video cameras, resulting in an increased need for computer vision algorithms that extract useful information from video data. Here we introduce a new video analysis tool that combines the output of supervised pose estimation algorithms (e.g. DeepLabCut) with unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods to produce interpretable, low-dimensional representations of behavioral videos that extract more information than pose estimates alone. We demonstrate this tool by extracting interpretable behavioral features from videos of three different head-fixed mouse preparations, as well as a freely moving mouse in an open field arena, and show how these interpretable features can facilitate downstream behavioral and neural analyses. We also show how the behavioral features produced by our model improve the precision and interpretation of these downstream analyses compared to using the outputs of either fully supervised or fully unsupervised methods alone.",

        "Abstract": "Sex differences in the brain are prevalent throughout the animal kingdom and particularly well appreciated in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where male animals contain a little-studied set of 93 male-specific neurons. To make these neurons amenable for future study, we describe here how a multicolor reporter transgene, NeuroPAL, is capable of visualizing the distinct identities of all male-specific neurons. We used NeuroPAL to visualize and characterize a number of features of the male-specific nervous system. We provide several proofs of concept for using NeuroPAL to identify the sites of expression of gfp-tagged reporter genes and for cellular fate analysis by analyzing the effect of removal of several developmental patterning genes on neuronal identity acquisition. We use NeuroPAL and its intrinsic cohort of more than 40 distinct differentiation markers to show that, even though male-specific neurons are generated throughout all four larval stages, they execute their terminal differentiation program in a coordinated manner in the fourth larval stage. This coordinated wave of differentiation, which we call 'just-in-time' differentiation, couples neuronal maturation programs with the appearance of sexual organs.",

        "Abstract": "Decoding sensory stimuli from neural activity can provide insight into how the nervous system might interpret the physical environment, and facilitates the development of brain-machine interfaces. Nevertheless, the neural decoding problem remains a significant open challenge. Here, we present an efficient nonlinear decoding approach for inferring natural scene stimuli from the spiking activities of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Our approach uses neural networks to improve on existing decoders in both accuracy and scalability. Trained and validated on real retinal spike data from more than 1000 simultaneously recorded macaque RGC units, the decoder demonstrates the necessity of nonlinear computations for accurate decoding of the fine structures of visual stimuli. Specifically, high-pass spatial features of natural images can only be decoded using nonlinear techniques, while low-pass features can be extracted equally well by linear and nonlinear methods. Together, these results advance the state of the art in decoding natural stimuli from large populations of neurons.",

        "Abstract": "Measurements of neuronal activity across brain areas are important for understanding the neural correlates of cognitive and motor processes such as attention, decision-making and action selection. However, techniques that allow cellular resolution measurements are expensive and require a high degree of technical expertise, which limits their broad use. Wide-field imaging of genetically encoded indicators is a high-throughput, cost-effective and flexible approach to measure activity of specific cell populations with high temporal resolution and a cortex-wide field of view. Here we outline our protocol for assembling a wide-field macroscope setup, performing surgery to prepare the intact skull and imaging neural activity chronically in behaving, transgenic mice. Further, we highlight a processing pipeline that leverages novel, cloud-based methods to analyze large-scale imaging datasets. The protocol targets laboratories that are seeking to build macroscopes, optimize surgical procedures for long-term chronic imaging and/or analyze cortex-wide neuronal recordings. The entire protocol, including steps for assembly and calibration of the macroscope, surgical preparation, imaging and data analysis, requires a total of 8 h. It is designed to be accessible to laboratories with limited expertise in imaging methods or interest in high-throughput imaging during behavior.",

Genetically encoded voltage indicators are a promising tool for this purpose, and recent developments have achieved a high signal-to-noise ratio in\u00a0vivo with 1-photon fluorescence imaging. However, these recordings exhibit several sources of noise and signal extraction remains a challenge. We present an improved signal extraction pipeline, spike-guided penalized matrix decomposition-nonnegative matrix factorization (SGPMD-NMF), which resolves supra- and subthreshold voltages in\u00a0vivo. The method incorporates biophysical and optical constraints. We validate the pipeline with simultaneous patch-clamp and optical recordings from mouse layer 1 in\u00a0vivo and with simulated and composite datasets with realistic noise. We demonstrate applications to mouse hippocampus expressing paQuasAr3-s or SomArchon1, mouse cortex expressing SomArchon1 or Voltron, and zebrafish spines expressing zArchon1.",

        "Abstract": "Modern spatial transcriptomics methods can target thousands of different types of RNA transcripts in a single slice of tissue. Many biological applications demand a high spatial density of transcripts relative to the imaging resolution, leading to partial mixing of transcript rolonies in many voxels; unfortunately, current analysis methods do not perform robustly in this highly-mixed setting. Here we develop a new analysis approach, BARcode DEmixing through Non-negative Spatial Regression (BarDensr): we start with a generative model of the physical process that leads to the observed image data and then apply sparse convex optimization methods to estimate the underlying (demixed) rolony densities. We apply BarDensr to simulated and real data and find that it achieves state of the art signal recovery, particularly in densely-labeled regions or data with low spatial resolution. Finally, BarDensr is fast and parallelizable. We provide open-source code as well as an implementation for the 'NeuroCAAS' cloud platform.",

        "Abstract": "Comprehensively resolving neuronal identities in whole-brain images is a major challenge. We achieve this in C.\u00a0elegans by engineering a multicolor transgene called NeuroPAL (a neuronal polychromatic atlas of landmarks). NeuroPAL worms share a stereotypical multicolor fluorescence map for the entire hermaphrodite nervous system that resolves all neuronal identities. Neurons labeled with NeuroPAL do not exhibit fluorescence in the green, cyan, or yellow emission channels, allowing the transgene to be used with numerous reporters of gene expression or neuronal dynamics. We showcase three applications that leverage NeuroPAL for nervous-system-wide neuronal identification. First, we determine the brainwide expression patterns of all metabotropic receptors for acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate, completing a map of this communication network. Second, we uncover changes in cell fate caused by transcription factor mutations. Third, we record brainwide activity in response to attractive and repulsive chemosensory cues, characterizing multimodal coding for these stimuli.",

        "Abstract": "Widefield calcium imaging enables recording of large-scale neural activity across the mouse dorsal cortex. In order to examine the relationship of these neural signals to the resulting behavior, it is critical to demix the recordings into meaningful spatial and temporal components that can be mapped onto well-defined brain regions. However, no current tools satisfactorily extract the activity of the different brain regions in individual mice in a data-driven manner, while taking into account mouse-specific and preparation-specific differences. Here, we introduce Localized semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (LocaNMF), a method that efficiently decomposes widefield video data and allows us to directly compare activity across multiple mice by outputting mouse-specific localized functional regions that are significantly more interpretable than more traditional decomposition techniques. Moreover, it provides a natural subspace to directly compare correlation maps and neural dynamics across different behaviors, mice, and experimental conditions, and enables identification of task- and movement-related brain regions.",

However, the utility of existing GEVIs has been limited by the brightness and photostability of fluorescent proteins and rhodopsins. We engineered a GEVI, called Voltron, that uses bright and photostable synthetic dyes instead of protein-based fluorophores, thereby extending the number of neurons imaged simultaneously in vivo by a factor of 10 and enabling imaging for significantly longer durations relative to existing GEVIs. We used Voltron for in vivo voltage imaging in mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies. In the mouse cortex, Voltron allowed single-trial recording of spikes and subthreshold voltage signals from dozens of neurons simultaneously over a 15-minute period of continuous imaging. In larval zebrafish, Voltron enabled the precise correlation of spike timing with behavior.",

        "Abstract": "The neocortex is functionally organized into layers. Layer four receives the densest bottom up sensory inputs, while layers 2/3 and 5 receive top down inputs that may convey predictive information. A subset of cortical somatostatin (SST) neurons, the Martinotti cells, gate top down input by inhibiting the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in layers 2/3 and 5, but it is unknown whether an analogous inhibitory mechanism controls activity in layer 4. Using high precision circuit mapping, in vivo optogenetic perturbations, and single cell transcriptional profiling, we reveal complementary circuits in the mouse barrel cortex involving genetically distinct SST subtypes that specifically and reciprocally interconnect with excitatory cells in different layers: Martinotti cells connect with layers 2/3 and 5, whereas non-Martinotti cells connect with layer 4. By enforcing layer-specific inhibition, these parallel SST subnetworks could independently regulate the balance between bottom up and top down input.",

        "Abstract": "The mammalian brain can form associations between behaviorally relevant stimuli in an animal's environment. While such learning is thought to primarily involve high-order association cortex, even primary sensory areas receive long-range connections carrying information that could contribute to high-level representations. Here, we imaged layer 1 apical dendrites in the barrel cortex of mice performing a whisker-based operant behavior. In addition to sensory-motor events, calcium signals in apical dendrites of layers 2/3 and 5 neurons and in layer 2/3 somata track the delivery of rewards, both choice related and randomly administered. Reward-related tuft-wide dendritic spikes emerge gradually with training and are task specific. Learning recruits cells whose intrinsic activity coincides with the time of reinforcement. Layer 4 largely lacked reward-related signals, suggesting a source other than the primary thalamus. Our results demonstrate that a sensory cortex can acquire a set of associations outside its immediate sensory modality and linked to salient behavioral events.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, two-photon calcium imaging has become a standard tool to probe the function of neural circuits and to study computations in neuronal populations. However, the acquired signal is only an indirect measurement of neural activity due to the comparatively slow dynamics of fluorescent calcium indicators. Different algorithms for estimating spike rates from noisy calcium measurements have been proposed in the past, but it is an open question how far performance can be improved. Here, we report the results of the spikefinder challenge, launched to catalyze the development of new spike rate inference algorithms through crowd-sourcing. We present ten of the submitted algorithms which show improved performance compared to previously evaluated methods. Interestingly, the top-performing algorithms are based on a wide range of principles from deep neural networks to generative models, yet provide highly correlated estimates of the neural activity. The competition shows that benchmark challenges can drive algorithmic developments in neuroscience.",

        "Abstract": "In vivo calcium imaging through microendoscopic lenses enables imaging of previously inaccessible neuronal populations deep within the brains of freely moving animals. However, it is computationally challenging to extract single-neuronal activity from microendoscopic data, because of the very large background fluctuations and high spatial overlaps intrinsic to this recording modality. Here, we describe a new constrained matrix factorization approach to accurately separate the background and then demix and denoise the neuronal signals of interest. We compared the proposed method against previous independent components analysis and constrained nonnegative matrix factorization approaches. On both simulated and experimental data recorded from mice, our method substantially improved the quality of extracted cellular signals and detected more well-isolated neural signals, especially in noisy data regimes. These advances can in turn significantly enhance the statistical power of downstream analyses, and ultimately improve scientific conclusions derived from microendoscopic data.",

        "Abstract": "The hippocampus is traditionally thought to transmit contextual information to limbic structures where it acquires valence. Using freely moving calcium imaging and optogenetics, we show that while the dorsal CA1 subregion of the hippocampus is enriched in place cells, ventral CA1 (vCA1) is enriched in anxiety cells that are activated by anxiogenic environments and required for avoidance behavior. Imaging cells defined by their projection target revealed that anxiety cells were enriched in the vCA1 population projecting to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) but not to the basal amygdala (BA). Consistent with this selectivity, optogenetic activation of vCA1 terminals in LHA but not BA increased anxiety and avoidance, while activation of terminals in BA but not LHA impaired contextual fear memory. Thus, the hippocampus encodes not only neutral but also valence-related contextual information, and the vCA1-LHA pathway is a direct route by which the hippocampus can rapidly influence innate anxiety behavior.",

        "Abstract": "Simultaneous electrical stimulation and recording using multi-electrode arrays can provide a valuable technique for studying circuit connectivity and engineering neural interfaces. However, interpreting these measurements is challenging because the spike sorting process (identifying and segregating action potentials arising from different neurons) is greatly complicated by electrical stimulation artifacts across the array, which can exhibit complex and nonlinear waveforms, and overlap temporarily with evoked spikes. Here we develop a scalable algorithm based on a structured Gaussian Process model to estimate the artifact and identify evoked spikes. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated in both real and simulated 512-electrode recordings in the peripheral primate retina with single-electrode and several types of multi-electrode stimulation. We establish small error rates in the identification of evoked spikes, with a computational complexity that is compatible with real-time data analysis. This technology may be helpful in the design of future high-resolution sensory prostheses based on tailored stimulation (e.g., retinal prostheses), and for closed-loop neural stimulation at a much larger scale than currently possible.",

        "Abstract": "Activity in striatal direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs) is critical for proper movement. However, little is known about the spatiotemporal organization of this activity. We investigated the spatiotemporal organization of SPN ensemble activity in mice during self-paced, natural movements using microendoscopic imaging. Activity in both pathways showed predominantly local but also some long-range correlations. Using a novel approach to cluster and quantify behaviors based on continuous accelerometer and video data, we found that SPN ensembles active during specific actions were spatially closer and more correlated overall. Furthermore, similarity between different actions corresponded to the similarity between SPN ensemble patterns, irrespective of movement speed. Consistently, the accuracy of decoding behavior from SPN ensemble patterns was directly related to the dissimilarity between behavioral clusters. These results identify a predominantly local, but not spatially compact, organization of direct- and indirect-pathway SPN activity that maps action space independently of movement speed.",

        "Title": "Multi-scale approaches for high-speed imaging and analysis of large neural populations.",
        "Abstract": "Progress in modern neuroscience critically depends on our ability to observe the activity of large neuronal populations with cellular spatial and high temporal resolution. However, two bottlenecks constrain efforts towards fast imaging of large populations. First, the resulting large video data is challenging to analyze. Second, there is an explicit tradeoff between imaging speed, signal-to-noise, and field of view: with current recording technology we cannot image very large neuronal populations with simultaneously high spatial and temporal resolution. Here we describe multi-scale approaches for alleviating both of these bottlenecks. First, we show that spatial and temporal decimation techniques based on simple local averaging provide order-of-magnitude speedups in spatiotemporally demixing calcium video data into estimates of single-cell neural activity. Second, once the shapes of individual neurons have been identified at fine scale (e.g., after an initial phase of conventional imaging with standard temporal and spatial resolution), we find that the spatial/temporal resolution tradeoff shifts dramatically: after demixing we can accurately recover denoised fluorescence traces and deconvolved neural activity of each individual neuron from coarse scale data that has been spatially decimated by an order of magnitude. This offers a cheap method for compressing this large video data, and also implies that it is possible to either speed up imaging significantly, or to \"zoom out\" by a corresponding factor to image order-of-magnitude larger neuronal populations with minimal loss in accuracy or temporal resolution.",

        "Abstract": "Cerebellar granule cells, which constitute half the brain's neurons, supply Purkinje cells with contextual information necessary for motor learning, but how they encode this information is unknown. Here we show, using two-photon microscopy to track neural activity over multiple days of cerebellum-dependent eyeblink conditioning in mice, that granule cell populations acquire a dense representation of the anticipatory eyelid movement. Initially, granule cells responded to neutral visual and somatosensory stimuli as well as periorbital airpuffs used for training. As learning progressed, two-thirds of monitored granule cells acquired a conditional response whose timing matched or preceded the learned eyelid movements. Granule cell activity covaried trial by trial to form a redundant code. Many granule cells were also active during movements of nearby body structures. Thus, a predictive signal about the upcoming movement is widely available at the input stage of the cerebellar cortex, as required by forward models of cerebellar control.",

        "Abstract": "Fluorescent calcium indicators are a popular means for observing the spiking activity of large neuronal populations, but extracting the activity of each neuron from raw fluorescence calcium imaging data is a nontrivial problem. We present a fast online active set method to solve this sparse non-negative deconvolution problem. Importantly, the algorithm 3progresses through each time series sequentially from beginning to end, thus enabling real-time online estimation of neural activity during the imaging session. Our algorithm is a generalization of the pool adjacent violators algorithm (PAVA) for isotonic regression and inherits its linear-time computational complexity. We gain remarkable increases in processing speed: more than one order of magnitude compared to currently employed state of the art convex solvers relying on interior point methods. Unlike these approaches, our method can exploit warm starts; therefore optimizing model hyperparameters only requires a handful of passes through the data. A minor modification can further improve the quality of activity inference by imposing a constraint on the minimum spike size. The algorithm enables real-time simultaneous deconvolution of O(105) traces of whole-brain larval zebrafish imaging data on a laptop.",

        "Abstract": "The zebra finch brain features a set of clearly defined\u00a0and hierarchically arranged motor nuclei that are selectively responsible for producing singing behavior. One of these regions, a critical forebrain structure called HVC, contains premotor neurons that are active at precise time points during song production. However, the neural representation of this behavior at a population level remains elusive. We used two-photon microscopy to monitor ensemble activity during singing, integrating across multiple trials by adopting a Bayesian inference approach to more precisely estimate burst timing. Additionally, we examined spiking and motor-related synaptic inputs using intracellular recordings during singing. With both experimental approaches, we find that premotor events do not occur preferentially at the onsets or offsets of song syllables or at specific subsyllabic motor landmarks. These results strongly support the\u00a0notion that HVC projection neurons collectively exhibit a temporal sequence during singing that is uncoupled from ongoing movements.",

        "Abstract": "Neuroprosthetic brain-computer interfaces function via an algorithm which decodes neural activity of the user into movements of an end effector, such as a cursor or robotic arm. In practice, the decoder is often learned by updating its parameters while the user performs a task. When the user's intention is not directly observable, recent methods have demonstrated value in training the decoder against a surrogate for the user's intended movement. Here we show that training a decoder in this way is a novel variant of an imitation learning problem, where an oracle or expert is employed for supervised training in lieu of direct observations, which are not available. Specifically, we describe how a generic imitation learning meta-algorithm, dataset aggregation (DAgger), can be adapted to train a generic brain-computer interface. By deriving existing learning algorithms for brain-computer interfaces in this framework, we provide a novel analysis of regret (an important metric of learning efficacy) for brain-computer interfaces. This analysis allows us to characterize the space of algorithmic variants and bounds on their regret rates. Existing approaches for decoder learning have been performed in the cursor control setting, but the available design principles for these decoders are such that it has been impossible to scale them to naturalistic settings. Leveraging our findings, we then offer an algorithm that combines imitation learning with optimal control, which should allow for training of arbitrary effectors for which optimal control can generate goal-oriented control. We demonstrate this novel and general BCI algorithm with simulated neuroprosthetic control of a 26 degree-of-freedom model of an arm, a sophisticated and realistic end effector.",

To infer cell-type diversity from partial or incomplete transcription factor expression data, we devised a sparse Bayesian framework that is able to handle estimation uncertainty and can incorporate diverse cellular characteristics to optimize experimental design. Focusing on spinal V1 inhibitory interneurons, for which the spatial expression of 19 transcription factors has been mapped, we infer the existence of ~50 candidate V1 neuronal types, many of which localize in compact spatial domains in the ventral spinal cord. We have validated the existence of inferred cell types by direct experimental measurement, establishing this Bayesian framework as an effective platform for cell-type characterization in the nervous system and elsewhere.",

Our goal is to simultaneously identify the locations of the neurons, demix spatially overlapping components, and denoise and deconvolve the spiking activity from the slow dynamics of the calcium indicator. Our approach relies on a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization that expresses the spatiotemporal fluorescence activity as the product of a spatial matrix that encodes the spatial footprint of each neuron in the optical field and a temporal matrix that characterizes the calcium concentration of each neuron over time. This framework is combined with a novel constrained deconvolution approach that extracts estimates of neural activity from fluorescence traces, to create a spatiotemporal processing algorithm that requires minimal parameter tuning. We demonstrate the general applicability of our method by applying it to in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo multi-neuronal imaging data, whole-brain light-sheet imaging data, and dendritic imaging data.",

Here we present a simple holographic method to simultaneously perform two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal populations across multiple areas and layers of mouse cortex in\u00a0vivo. We use prior knowledge of neuronal locations, activity sparsity, and a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm to extract signals from neurons imaged simultaneously and located in different focal planes or fields of view. Our laser multiplexing approach is simple and fast, and could be used as a general method to image the activity of neural circuits in three dimensions across multiple areas in the brain.",

        "Abstract": "The function of a neural circuit is shaped by the computations performed by its interneurons, which in many cases are not easily accessible to experimental investigation. Here, we elucidate the transformation of visual signals flowing from the input to the output of the primate retina, using a combination of large-scale multi-electrode recordings from an identified ganglion cell type, visual stimulation targeted at individual cone photoreceptors, and a hierarchical computational model. The results reveal nonlinear subunits in the circuity of OFF midget ganglion cells, which subserve high-resolution vision. The model explains light responses to a variety of stimuli more accurately than a linear model, including stimuli targeted to cones within and across subunits. The recovered model components are consistent with known anatomical organization of midget bipolar interneurons. These results reveal the spatial structure of linear and nonlinear encoding, at the resolution of single cells and at the scale of complete circuits.",

        "Abstract": "Inferring connectivity in neuronal networks remains a key challenge in statistical neuroscience. The \"common input\" problem presents a major roadblock: it is difficult to reliably distinguish causal connections between pairs of observed neurons versus correlations induced by common input from unobserved neurons. Available techniques allow us to simultaneously record, with sufficient temporal resolution, only a small fraction of the network. Consequently, naive connectivity estimators that neglect these common input effects are highly biased. This work proposes a \"shotgun\" experimental design, in which we observe multiple sub-networks briefly, in a serial manner. Thus, while the full network cannot be observed simultaneously at any given time, we may be able to observe much larger subsets of the network over the course of the entire experiment, thus ameliorating the common input problem. Using a generalized linear model for a spiking recurrent neural network, we develop a scalable approximate expected loglikelihood-based Bayesian method to perform network inference given this type of data, in which only a small fraction of the network is observed in each time bin. We demonstrate in simulation that the shotgun experimental design can eliminate the biases induced by common input effects. Networks with thousands of neurons, in which only a small fraction of the neurons is observed in each time bin, can be quickly and accurately estimated, achieving orders of magnitude speed up over previous approaches.",

        "Abstract": "Spinal circuits can generate locomotor output in the absence of sensory or descending input, but the principles of locomotor circuit organization remain unclear. We sought insight into these principles by considering the elaboration of locomotor circuits across evolution. The identity of limb-innervating motor neurons was reverted to a state resembling that of motor neurons that direct undulatory swimming in primitive aquatic vertebrates, permitting assessment of the role of motor neuron identity in determining locomotor pattern. Two-photon imaging was coupled with spike inference to measure locomotor firing in hundreds of motor neurons in isolated mouse spinal cords. In wild-type preparations, we observed sequential recruitment of motor neurons innervating flexor muscles controlling progressively more distal joints. Strikingly, after reversion of motor neuron identity, virtually all firing patterns became distinctly flexor like. Our findings show that motor neuron identity directs locomotor circuit wiring and indicate the evolutionary primacy of flexor pattern generation.",

        "Abstract": "Neuroprosthetic brain-computer interfaces are systems that decode neural activity into useful control signals for effectors, such as a cursor on a computer screen. It has long been recognized that both the user and decoding system can adapt to increase the accuracy of the end effector. Co-adaptation is the process whereby a user learns to control the system in conjunction with the decoder adapting to learn the user's neural patterns. We provide a mathematical framework for co-adaptation and relate co-adaptation to the joint optimization of the user's control scheme (\"encoding model\") and the decoding algorithm's parameters. When the assumptions of that framework are respected, co-adaptation cannot yield better performance than that obtainable by an optimal initial choice of fixed decoder, coupled with optimal user learning. For a specific case, we provide numerical methods to obtain such an optimized decoder. We demonstrate our approach in a model brain-computer interface system using an online prosthesis simulator, a simple human-in-the-loop pyschophysics setup which provides a non-invasive simulation of the BCI setting. These experiments support two claims: that users can learn encoders matched to fixed, optimal decoders and that, once learned, our approach yields expected performance advantages.",

        "Abstract": "Parametric models of the conditional intensity of a point process (e.g., generalized linear models) are popular in statistical neuroscience, as they allow us to characterize the variability in neural responses in terms of stimuli and spiking history. Parameter estimation in these models relies heavily on accurate evaluations of the log likelihood and its derivatives. Classical approaches use a discretized time version of the spiking process, and recent work has exploited the existence of a refractory period (during which the conditional intensity is zero following a spike) to obtain more accurate estimates of the likelihood. In this brief letter, we demonstrate that this method can be improved significantly by applying classical quadrature methods directly to the resulting continuous-time integral.",

        "Abstract": "Of all of the sensory areas, barrel cortex is among the best understood in terms of circuitry, yet least understood in terms of sensory function. We combined intracellular recording in rats with a multi-directional, multi-whisker stimulator system to estimate receptive fields by reverse correlation of stimuli to synaptic inputs. Spatiotemporal receptive fields were identified orders of magnitude faster than by conventional spike-based approaches, even for neurons with little spiking activity. Given a suitable stimulus representation, a linear model captured the stimulus-response relationship for all neurons with high accuracy. In contrast with conventional single-whisker stimuli, complex stimuli revealed markedly sharpened receptive fields, largely as a result of adaptation. This phenomenon allowed the surround to facilitate rather than to suppress responses to the principal whisker. Optimized stimuli enhanced firing in layers 4-6, but not in layers 2/3, which remained sparsely active. Surround facilitation through adaptation may be required for discriminating complex shapes and textures during natural sensing.",

        "Abstract": "We present fast methods for filtering voltage measurements and performing optimal inference of the location and strength of synaptic connections in large dendritic trees. Given noisy, subsampled voltage observations we develop fast l1-penalized regression methods for Kalman state-space models of the neuron voltage dynamics. The value of the l1-penalty parameter is chosen using cross-validation or, for low signal-to-noise ratio, a Mallows' Cp-like criterion. Using low-rank approximations, we reduce the inference runtime from cubic to linear in the number of dendritic compartments. We also present an alternative, fully Bayesian approach to the inference problem using a spike-and-slab prior. We illustrate our results with simulations on toy and real neuronal geometries. We consider observation schemes that either scan the dendritic geometry uniformly or measure linear combinations of voltages across several locations with random coefficients. For the latter, we show how to choose the coefficients to offset the correlation between successive measurements imposed by the neuron dynamics. This results in a \"compressed sensing\" observation scheme, with an important reduction in the number of measurements required to infer the synaptic weights.",

        "Abstract": "Generalized linear models play an essential role in a wide variety of statistical applications. This paper discusses an approximation of the likelihood in these models that can greatly facilitate computation. The basic idea is to replace a sum that appears in the exact log-likelihood by an expectation over the model covariates; the resulting \"expected log-likelihood\" can in many cases be computed significantly faster than the exact log-likelihood. In many neuroscience experiments the distribution over model covariates is controlled by the experimenter and the expected log-likelihood approximation becomes particularly useful; for example, estimators based on maximizing this expected log-likelihood (or a penalized version thereof) can often be obtained with orders of magnitude computational savings compared to the exact maximum likelihood estimators. A risk analysis establishes that these maximum EL estimators often come with little cost in accuracy (and in some cases even improved accuracy) compared to standard maximum likelihood estimates. Finally, we find that these methods can significantly decrease the computation time of marginal likelihood calculations for model selection and of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for sampling from the posterior parameter distribution. We illustrate our results by applying these methods to a computationally-challenging dataset of neural spike trains obtained via large-scale multi-electrode recordings in the primate retina.",

        "Abstract": "We investigate Bayesian methods for optimal decoding of noisy or incompletely-observed spike trains. Information about neural identity or temporal resolution may be lost during spike detection and sorting, or spike times measured near the soma may be corrupted with noise due to stochastic membrane channel effects in the axon. We focus on neural encoding models in which the (discrete) neural state evolves according to stimulus-dependent Markovian dynamics. Such models are sufficiently flexible that we may incorporate realistic stimulus encoding and spiking dynamics, but nonetheless permit exact computation via efficient hidden Markov model forward-backward methods. We analyze two types of signal degradation. First, we quantify the information lost due to jitter or downsampling in the spike-times. Second, we quantify the information lost when knowledge of the identities of different spiking neurons is corrupted. In each case the methods introduced here make it possible to quantify the dependence of the information loss on biophysical parameters such as firing rate, spike jitter amplitude, spike observation noise, etc. In particular, decoders that model the probability distribution of spike-neuron assignments significantly outperform decoders that use only the most likely spike assignments, and are ignorant of the posterior spike assignment uncertainty.",

The predictions of this efficient coding hypothesis regarding the spatial filtering properties of the visual system have been found consistent with human perception, but they have not been compared directly with neural responses. Here, we analyze the information that retinal ganglion cells transmit to the brain about the spatial information in natural images subject to three resource constraints: the number of retinal ganglion cells, their total response variances, and their total synaptic strengths. We derive a model that optimizes the transmitted information and compare it directly with measurements of complete functional connectivity between cone photoreceptors and the four major types of ganglion cells in the primate retina, obtained at single-cell resolution. We find that the ganglion cell population exhibited 80% efficiency in transmitting spatial information relative to the model. Both the retina and the model exhibited high redundancy (~30%) among ganglion cells of the same cell type. A novel and unique prediction of efficient coding, the relationships between projection patterns of individual cones to all ganglion cells, was consistent with the observed projection patterns in the retina. These results indicate a high level of efficiency with near-optimal redundancy in visual signaling by the retina.",

        "Abstract": "We discuss methods for fast spatiotemporal smoothing of calcium signals in dendritic trees, given single-trial, spatially localized imaging data obtained via multi-photon microscopy. By analyzing the dynamics of calcium binding to probe molecules and the effects of the imaging procedure, we show that calcium concentration can be estimated up to an affine transformation, i.e., an additive and multiplicative constant. To obtain a full spatiotemporal estimate, we model calcium dynamics within the cell using a functional approach. The evolution of calcium concentration is represented through a smaller set of hidden variables that incorporate fast transients due to backpropagating action potentials (bAPs), or other forms of stimulation. Because of the resulting state space structure, inference can be done in linear time using forward-backward maximum-a-posteriori methods. Non-negativity constraints on the calcium concentration can also be incorporated using a log-barrier method that does not affect the computational scaling. Moreover, by exploiting the neuronal tree structure we show that the cost of the algorithm is also linear in the size of the dendritic tree, making the approach applicable to arbitrarily large trees. We apply this algorithm to data obtained from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells with experimentally evoked bAPs, some of which were paired with excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). The algorithm recovers the timing of the bAPs and provides an estimate of the induced calcium transient throughout the tree. The proposed methods could be used to further understand the interplay between bAPs and EPSPs in synaptic strength modification. More generally, this approach allows us to infer the concentration on intracellular calcium across the dendritic tree from noisy observations at a discrete set of points in space.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, the problem of reconstructing the connectivity in large neural circuits (\"connectomics\") has re-emerged as one of the main objectives of neuroscience. Classically, reconstructions of neural connectivity have been approached anatomically, using electron or light microscopy and histological tracing methods. This paper describes a statistical approach for connectivity reconstruction that relies on relatively easy-to-obtain measurements using fluorescent probes such as synaptic markers, cytoplasmic dyes, transsynaptic tracers, or activity-dependent dyes. We describe the possible design of these experiments and develop a Bayesian framework for extracting synaptic neural connectivity from such data. We show that the statistical reconstruction problem can be formulated naturally as a tractable L\u2081-regularized quadratic optimization. As a concrete example, we consider a realistic hypothetical connectivity reconstruction experiment in C. elegans, a popular neuroscience model where a complete wiring diagram has been previously obtained based on long-term electron microscopy work. We show that the new statistical approach could lead to an orders of magnitude reduction in experimental effort in reconstructing the connectivity in this circuit. We further demonstrate that the spatial heterogeneity and biological variability in the connectivity matrix--not just the \"average\" connectivity--can also be estimated using the same method.",

        "Abstract": "Synchronized spontaneous firing among retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), on timescales faster than visual responses, has been reported in many studies. Two candidate mechanisms of synchronized firing include direct coupling and shared noisy inputs. In neighboring parasol cells of primate retina, which exhibit rapid synchronized firing that has been studied extensively, recent experimental work indicates that direct electrical or synaptic coupling is weak, but shared synaptic input in the absence of modulated stimuli is strong. However, previous modeling efforts have not accounted for this aspect of firing in the parasol cell population. Here we develop a new model that incorporates the effects of common noise, and apply it to analyze the light responses and synchronized firing of a large, densely-sampled network of over 250 simultaneously recorded parasol cells. We use a generalized linear model in which the spike rate in each cell is determined by the linear combination of the spatio-temporally filtered visual input, the temporally filtered prior spikes of that cell, and unobserved sources representing common noise. The model accurately captures the statistical structure of the spike trains and the encoding of the visual stimulus, without the direct coupling assumption present in previous modeling work. Finally, we examined the problem of decoding the visual stimulus from the spike train given the estimated parameters. The common-noise model produces Bayesian decoding performance as accurate as that of a model with direct coupling, but with significantly more robustness to spike timing perturbations.",

        "Abstract": "We discuss methods for optimally inferring the synaptic inputs to an electrotonically compact neuron, given intracellular voltage-clamp or current-clamp recordings from the postsynaptic cell. These methods are based on sequential Monte Carlo techniques (\"particle filtering\"). We demonstrate, on model data, that these methods can recover the time course of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs accurately on a single trial. Depending on the observation noise level, no averaging over multiple trials may be required. However, excitatory inputs are consistently inferred more accurately than inhibitory inputs at physiological resting potentials, due to the stronger driving force associated with excitatory conductances. Once these synaptic input time courses are recovered, it becomes possible to fit (via tractable convex optimization techniques) models describing the relationship between the sensory stimulus and the observed synaptic input. We develop both parametric and nonparametric expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms that consist of alternating iterations between these synaptic recovery and model estimation steps. We employ a fast, robust convex optimization-based method to effectively initialize the filter; these fast methods may be of independent interest. The proposed methods could be applied to better understand the balance between excitation and inhibition in sensory processing in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Due to the limitations of current voltage sensing techniques, optimal filtering of noisy, undersampled voltage signals on dendritic trees is a key problem in computational cellular neuroscience. These limitations lead to voltage data that is incomplete (in the sense of only capturing a small portion of the full spatiotemporal signal) and often highly noisy. In this paper we use a Kalman filtering framework to develop optimal experimental design methods for voltage sampling. Our approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm with lazy evaluation to minimize the expected square error of the estimated spatiotemporal voltage signal. We take advantage of some particular features of the dendritic filtering problem to efficiently calculate the Kalman estimator's covariance. We test our framework with simulations of real dendritic branching structures and compare the quality of both time-invariant and time-varying sampling schemes. While the benefit of using the experimental design methods was modest in the time-invariant case, improvements of 25-100% over more na\u00efve methods were found when the observation locations were allowed to change with time. We also present a heuristic approximation to the greedy algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster while still providing comparable results.",

        "Abstract": "Visual neurons can respond with extremely precise temporal patterning to visual stimuli that change on much slower time scales. Here, we investigate how the precise timing of cat thalamic spike trains-which can have timing as precise as 1 ms-is related to the stimulus, in the context of both artificial noise and natural visual stimuli. Using a nonlinear modeling framework applied to extracellular data, we demonstrate that the precise timing of thalamic spike trains can be explained by the interplay between an excitatory input and a delayed suppressive input that resembles inhibition, such that neuronal responses only occur in brief windows where excitation exceeds suppression. The resulting description of thalamic computation resembles earlier models of contrast adaptation, suggesting a more general role for mechanisms of contrast adaptation in visual processing. Thus, we describe a more complex computation underlying thalamic responses to artificial and natural stimuli that has implications for understanding how visual information is represented in the early stages of visual processing.",

        "Abstract": "A constrained point-process filtering mechanism for prediction of electromyogram (EMG) signals from multichannel neural spike recordings is proposed here. Filters from the Kalman family are inherently suboptimal in dealing with non-Gaussian observations, or a state evolution that deviates from the Gaussianity assumption. To address these limitations, we modeled the non-Gaussian neural spike train observations by using a generalized linear model that encapsulates covariates of neural activity, including the neurons' own spiking history, concurrent ensemble activity, and extrinsic covariates (EMG signals). In order to predict the envelopes of EMGs, we reformulated the Kalman filter in an optimization framework and utilized a nonnegativity constraint. This structure characterizes the nonlinear correspondence between neural activity and EMG signals reasonably. The EMGs were recorded from 12 forearm and hand muscles of a behaving monkey during a grip-force task. In the case of limited training data, the constrained point-process filter improved the prediction accuracy when compared to a conventional Wiener cascade filter (a linear causal filter followed by a static nonlinearity) for different bin sizes and delays between input spikes and EMG output. For longer training datasets, results of the proposed filter and that of the Wiener cascade filter were comparable.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in experimental stimulation methods have raised the following important computational question: how can we choose a stimulus that will drive a neuron to output a target spike train with optimal precision, given physiological constraints? Here we adopt an approach based on models that describe how a stimulating agent (such as an injected electrical current or a laser light interacting with caged neurotransmitters or photosensitive ion channels) affects the spiking activity of neurons. Based on these models, we solve the reverse problem of finding the best time-dependent modulation of the input, subject to hardware limitations as well as physiologically inspired safety measures, that causes the neuron to emit a spike train that with highest probability will be close to a target spike train. We adopt fast convex constrained optimization methods to solve this problem. Our methods can potentially be implemented in real time and may also be generalized to the case of many cells, suitable for neural prosthesis applications. With the use of biologically sensible parameters and constraints, our method finds stimulation patterns that generate very precise spike trains in simulated experiments. We also tested the intracellular current injection method on pyramidal cells in mouse cortical slices, quantifying the dependence of spiking reliability and timing precision on constraints imposed on the applied currents.",

        "Abstract": "Birdsong is comprised of rich spectral and temporal organization, which might be used for vocal perception. To quantify how this structure could be used, we have reconstructed birdsong spectrograms by combining the spike trains of zebra finch auditory midbrain neurons with information about the correlations present in song. We calculated maximum a posteriori estimates of song spectrograms using a generalized linear model of neuronal responses and a series of prior distributions, each carrying different amounts of statistical information about zebra finch song. We found that spike trains from a population of mesencephalicus lateral dorsalis (MLd) neurons combined with an uncorrelated Gaussian prior can estimate the amplitude envelope of song spectrograms. The same set of responses can be combined with Gaussian priors that have correlations matched to those found across multiple zebra finch songs to yield song spectrograms similar to those presented to the animal. The fidelity of spectrogram reconstructions from MLd responses relies more heavily on prior knowledge of spectral correlations than temporal correlations. However, the best reconstructions combine MLd responses with both spectral and temporal correlations.",

        "Abstract": "Given recent experimental results suggesting that neural circuits may evolve through multiple firing states, we develop a framework for estimating state-dependent neural response properties from spike train data. We modify the traditional hidden Markov model (HMM) framework to incorporate stimulus-driven, non-Poisson point-process observations. For maximal flexibility, we allow external, time-varying stimuli and the neurons' own spike histories to drive both the spiking behavior in each state and the transitioning behavior between states. We employ an appropriately modified expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters. The expectation step is solved by the standard forward-backward algorithm for HMMs. The maximization step reduces to a set of separable concave optimization problems if the model is restricted slightly. We first test our algorithm on simulated data and are able to fully recover the parameters used to generate the data and accurately recapitulate the sequence of hidden states. We then apply our algorithm to a recently published data set in which the observed neuronal ensembles displayed multistate behavior and show that inclusion of spike history information significantly improves the fit of the model. Additionally, we show that a simple reformulation of the state space of the underlying Markov chain allows us to implement a hybrid half-multistate, half-histogram model that may be more appropriate for capturing the complexity of certain data sets than either a simple HMM or a simple peristimulus time histogram model alone.",

        "Title": "A generalized linear model for estimating spectrotemporal receptive fields from responses to natural sounds.",
        "Abstract": "In the auditory system, the stimulus-response properties of single neurons are often described in terms of the spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF), a linear kernel relating the spectrogram of the sound stimulus to the instantaneous firing rate of the neuron. Several algorithms have been used to estimate STRFs from responses to natural stimuli; these algorithms differ in their functional models, cost functions, and regularization methods. Here, we characterize the stimulus-response function of auditory neurons using a generalized linear model (GLM). In this model, each cell's input is described by: 1) a stimulus filter (STRF); and 2) a post-spike filter, which captures dependencies on the neuron's spiking history. The output of the model is given by a series of spike trains rather than instantaneous firing rate, allowing the prediction of spike train responses to novel stimuli. We fit the model by maximum penalized likelihood to the spiking activity of zebra finch auditory midbrain neurons in response to conspecific vocalizations (songs) and modulation limited (ml) noise. We compare this model to normalized reverse correlation (NRC), the traditional method for STRF estimation, in terms of predictive power and the basic tuning properties of the estimated STRFs. We find that a GLM with a sparse prior predicts novel responses to both stimulus classes significantly better than NRC. Importantly, we find that STRFs from the two models derived from the same responses can differ substantially and that GLM STRFs are more consistent between stimulus classes than NRC STRFs. These results suggest that a GLM with a sparse prior provides a more accurate characterization of spectrotemporal tuning than does the NRC method when responses to complex sounds are studied in these neurons.",

These techniques offer a number of advantages: the estimates may be computed efficiently, come equipped with natural errorbars, adapt their smoothness automatically to the local density and informativeness of the observed data, and permit direct fitting of the model hyperparameters (e.g., the prior smoothness of the rate map) via maximum marginal likelihood.

        "Title": "Efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for decoding neural spike trains.",
        "Abstract": "Stimulus reconstruction or decoding methods provide an important tool for understanding how sensory and motor information is represented in neural activity. We discuss Bayesian decoding methods based on an encoding generalized linear model (GLM) that accurately describes how stimuli are transformed into the spike trains of a group of neurons. The form of the GLM likelihood ensures that the posterior distribution over the stimuli that caused an observed set of spike trains is log concave so long as the prior is. This allows the maximum a posteriori (MAP) stimulus estimate to be obtained using efficient optimization algorithms. Unfortunately, the MAP estimate can have a relatively large average error when the posterior is highly nongaussian. Here we compare several Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that allow for the calculation of general Bayesian estimators involving posterior expectations (conditional on model parameters). An efficient version of the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm was significantly superior to other MCMC methods for gaussian priors. When the prior distribution has sharp edges and corners, on the other hand, the \"hit-and-run\" algorithm performed better than other MCMC methods. Using these algorithms, we show that for this latter class of priors, the posterior mean estimate can have a considerably lower average error than MAP, whereas for gaussian priors, the two estimators have roughly equal efficiency. We also address the application of MCMC methods for extracting nonmarginal properties of the posterior distribution. For example, by using MCMC to calculate the mutual information between the stimulus and response, we verify the validity of a computationally efficient Laplace approximation to this quantity for gaussian priors in a wide range of model parameters; this makes direct model-based computation of the mutual information tractable even in the case of large observed neural populations, where methods based on binning the spike train fail. Finally, we consider the effect of uncertainty in the GLM parameters on the posterior estimators.",

Decoding methods, which provide an explicit means for reading out the information contained in neural spike responses, offer a powerful set of tools for studying the neural coding problem. Here we develop several decoding methods based on point-process neural encoding models, or forward models that predict spike responses to stimuli. These models have concave log-likelihood functions, which allow efficient maximum-likelihood model fitting and stimulus decoding. We present several applications of the encoding model framework to the problem of decoding stimulus information from population spike responses: (1) a tractable algorithm for computing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the stimulus, the most probable stimulus to have generated an observed single- or multiple-neuron spike train response, given some prior distribution over the stimulus; (2) a gaussian approximation to the posterior stimulus distribution that can be used to quantify the fidelity with which various stimulus features are encoded; (3) an efficient method for estimating the mutual information between the stimulus and the spike trains emitted by a neural population; and (4) a framework for the detection of change-point times (the time at which the stimulus undergoes a change in mean or variance) by marginalizing over the posterior stimulus distribution. We provide several examples illustrating the performance of these estimators with simulated and real neural data.",

        "Abstract": "To understand a neural circuit requires knowledge of its connectivity. Here we report measurements of functional connectivity between the input and ouput layers of the macaque retina at single-cell resolution and the implications of these for colour vision. Multi-electrode technology was used to record simultaneously from complete populations of the retinal ganglion cell types (midget, parasol and small bistratified) that transmit high-resolution visual signals to the brain. Fine-grained visual stimulation was used to identify the location, type and strength of the functional input of each cone photoreceptor to each ganglion cell. The populations of ON and OFF midget and parasol cells each sampled the complete population of long- and middle-wavelength-sensitive cones. However, only OFF midget cells frequently received strong input from short-wavelength-sensitive cones. ON and OFF midget cells showed a small non-random tendency to selectively sample from either long- or middle-wavelength-sensitive cones to a degree not explained by clumping in the cone mosaic. These measurements reveal computations in a neural circuit at the elementary resolution of individual neurons.",

        "Abstract": "Relay neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) receive direct visual input predominantly from a single retinal ganglion cell (RGC), in addition to indirect input from other sources including interneurons, thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), and the visual cortex. To address the extent of influence of these indirect sources on the response properties of the LGN neurons, we fit a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to the spike responses of cat LGN neurons driven by spatially homogeneous spots that were rapidly modulated by a pseudorandom luminance sequence. Several spot sizes were used to probe the spatial extent of the indirect visual effects. Our extracellular recordings captured both the LGN spikes and the incoming RGC input (S potentials), allowing us to divide the inputs to the GLM into two categories: the direct RGC input and the indirect input to which we have access through the luminance of the visual stimulus. For spots no larger than the receptive field center, the effect of the indirect input is negligible, while for larger spots its effect can, on average, account for 5% of the variance of the data and for as much as 25% in some cells. The polarity of the indirect visual influence is opposite to that of the linear receptive field of the neurons. We conclude that the indirect source of response modulation of the LGN relay neurons arises from inhibitory sources, compatible with thalamic interneurons or TRN.",

Here we describe two approximate methods for generating informative stimulus sequences: the first approach provides a fast method for scoring the informativeness of a batch of specific potential stimulus sequences, while the second method attempts to compute an optimal stimulus distribution from which the experimenter may easily sample. We apply these methods to single-neuron spike train data recorded from the auditory midbrain of zebra finches, and demonstrate that the resulting stimulus sequences do in fact provide more information about neuronal tuning in a shorter amount of time than do more standard experimental designs.",

        "Abstract": "Fluorescent calcium indicators are becoming increasingly popular as a means for observing the spiking activity of large neuronal populations. Unfortunately, extracting the spike train of each neuron from a raw fluorescence movie is a nontrivial problem. This work presents a fast nonnegative deconvolution filter to infer the approximately most likely spike train of each neuron, given the fluorescence observations. This algorithm outperforms optimal linear deconvolution (Wiener filtering) on both simulated and biological data. The performance gains come from restricting the inferred spike trains to be positive (using an interior-point method), unlike the Wiener filter. The algorithm runs in linear time, and is fast enough that even when simultaneously imaging >100 neurons, inference can be performed on the set of all observed traces faster than real time. Performing optimal spatial filtering on the images further refines the inferred spike train estimates. Importantly, all the parameters required to perform the inference can be estimated using only the fluorescence data, obviating the need to perform joint electrophysiological and imaging calibration experiments.",

        "Abstract": "Generalized linear models (GLMs) have been developed for modeling and decoding population neuronal spiking activity in the motor cortex. These models provide reasonable characterizations between neural activity and motor behavior. However, they lack a description of movement-related terms which are not observed directly in these experiments, such as muscular activation, the subject's level of attention, and other internal or external states. Here we propose to include a multi-dimensional hidden state to address these states in a GLM framework where the spike count at each time is described as a function of the hand state (position, velocity, and acceleration), truncated spike history, and the hidden state. The model can be identified by an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We tested this new method in two datasets where spikes were simultaneously recorded using a multi-electrode array in the primary motor cortex of two monkeys. It was found that this method significantly improves the model-fitting over the classical GLM, for hidden dimensions varying from 1 to 4. This method also provides more accurate decoding of hand state (reducing the mean square error by up to 29% in some cases), while retaining real-time computational efficiency. These improvements on representation and decoding over the classical GLM model suggest that this new approach could contribute as a useful tool to motor cortical decoding and prosthetic applications.",

        "Abstract": "Optimal filtering of noisy voltage signals on dendritic trees is a key problem in computational cellular neuroscience. However, the state variable in this problem-the vector of voltages at every compartment-is very high-dimensional: realistic multicompartmental models often have on the order of N = 10(4) compartments. Standard implementations of the Kalman filter require O(N (3)) time and O(N (2)) space, and are therefore impractical. Here we take advantage of three special features of the dendritic filtering problem to construct an efficient filter: (1) dendritic dynamics are governed by a cable equation on a tree, which may be solved using sparse matrix methods in O(N) time; and current methods for observing dendritic voltage (2) provide low SNR observations and (3) only image a relatively small number of compartments at a time. The idea is to approximate the Kalman equations in terms of a low-rank perturbation of the steady-state (zero-SNR) solution, which may be obtained in O(N) time using methods that exploit the sparse tree structure of dendritic dynamics. The resulting methods give a very good approximation to the exact Kalman solution, but only require O(N) time and space. We illustrate the method with applications to real and simulated dendritic branching structures, and describe how to extend the techniques to incorporate spatially subsampled, temporally filtered, and nonlinearly transformed observations.",

        "Abstract": "A major open problem in systems neuroscience is to understand the relationship between behavior and the detailed spiking properties of neural populations. We assess how faithfully velocity information can be decoded from a population of spiking model retinal neurons whose spatiotemporal receptive fields and ensemble spike train dynamics are closely matched to real data. We describe how to compute the optimal Bayesian estimate of image velocity given the population spike train response and show that, in the case of global translation of an image with known intensity profile, on average the spike train ensemble signals speed with a fractional standard deviation of about 2% across a specific set of stimulus conditions. We further show how to compute the Bayesian velocity estimate in the case where we only have some a priori information about the (naturalistic) spatial correlation structure of the image but do not know the image explicitly. As expected, the performance of the Bayesian decoder is shown to be less accurate with decreasing prior image information. There turns out to be a close mathematical connection between a biologically plausible \"motion energy\" method for decoding the velocity and the Bayesian decoder in the case that the image is not known. Simulations using the motion energy method and the Bayesian decoder with unknown image reveal that they result in fractional standard deviations of 10% and 6%, respectively, across the same set of stimulus conditions. Estimation performance is rather insensitive to the details of the precise receptive field location, correlated activity between cells, and spike timing.",

        "Title": "Mean-field approximations for coupled populations of generalized linear model spiking neurons with Markov refractoriness.",
        "Abstract": "There has recently been a great deal of interest in inferring network connectivity from the spike trains in populations of neurons. One class of useful models that can be fit easily to spiking data is based on generalized linear point process models from statistics. Once the parameters for these models are fit, the analyst is left with a nonlinear spiking network model with delays, which in general may be very difficult to understand analytically. Here we develop mean-field methods for approximating the stimulus-driven firing rates (in both the time-varying and steady-state cases), auto- and cross-correlations, and stimulus-dependent filtering properties of these networks. These approximations are valid when the contributions of individual network coupling terms are small and, hence, the total input to a neuron is approximately gaussian. These approximations lead to deterministic ordinary differential equations that are much easier to solve and analyze than direct Monte Carlo simulation of the network activity. These approximations also provide an analytical way to evaluate the linear input-output filter of neurons and how the filters are modulated by network interactions and some stimulus feature. Finally, in the case of strong refractory effects, the mean-field approximations in the generalized linear model become inaccurate; therefore, we introduce a model that captures strong refractoriness, retains all of the easy fitting properties of the standard generalized linear model, and leads to much more accurate approximations of mean firing rates and cross-correlations that retain fine temporal behaviors.",

        "Abstract": "State space methods have proven indispensable in neural data analysis. However, common methods for performing inference in state-space models with non-Gaussian observations rely on certain approximations which are not always accurate. Here we review direct optimization methods that avoid these approximations, but that nonetheless retain the computational efficiency of the approximate methods. We discuss a variety of examples, applying these direct optimization techniques to problems in spike train smoothing, stimulus decoding, parameter estimation, and inference of synaptic properties. Along the way, we point out connections to some related standard statistical methods, including spline smoothing and isotonic regression. Finally, we note that the computational methods reviewed here do not in fact depend on the state-space setting at all; instead, the key property we are exploiting involves the bandedness of certain matrices. We close by discussing some applications of this more general point of view, including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for neural decoding and efficient estimation of spatially-varying firing rates.",

        "Abstract": "As recent advances in calcium sensing technologies facilitate simultaneously imaging action potentials in neuronal populations, complementary analytical tools must also be developed to maximize the utility of this experimental paradigm. Although the observations here are fluorescence movies, the signals of interest--spike trains and/or time varying intracellular calcium concentrations--are hidden. Inferring these hidden signals is often problematic due to noise, nonlinearities, slow imaging rate, and unknown biophysical parameters. We overcome these difficulties by developing sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle filters) based on biophysical models of spiking, calcium dynamics, and fluorescence. We show that even in simple cases, the particle filters outperform the optimal linear (i.e., Wiener) filter, both by obtaining better estimates and by providing error bars. We then relax a number of our model assumptions to incorporate nonlinear saturation of the fluorescence signal, as well external stimulus and spike history dependence (e.g., refractoriness) of the spike trains. Using both simulations and in vitro fluorescence observations, we demonstrate temporal superresolution by inferring when within a frame each spike occurs. Furthermore, the model parameters may be estimated using expectation maximization with only a very limited amount of data (e.g., approximately 5-10 s or 5-40 spikes), without the requirement of any simultaneous electrophysiology or imaging experiments.",

        "Abstract": "The Kalman filter has been proposed as a model to decode neural activity measured from the motor cortex in order to obtain real-time estimates of hand motion in behavioral neurophysiological experiments. However, currently used linear state-space models underlying the Kalman filter do not take into account other behavioral states such as muscular activity or the subject's level of attention, which are often unobservable during experiments but may play important roles in characterizing neural controlled hand movement. To address this issue, we depict these unknown states as one multidimensional hidden state in the linear state-space framework. This new model assumes that the observed neural firing rate is directly related to this hidden state. The dynamics of the hand state are also allowed to impact the dynamics of the hidden state, and vice versa. The parameters in the model can be identified by a conventional expectation-maximization algorithm. Since this model still uses the linear Gaussian framework, hand-state decoding can be performed by the efficient Kalman filter algorithm. Experimental results show that this new model provides a more appropriate representation of the neural data and generates more accurate decoding. Furthermore, we have used recently developed computationally efficient methods by incorporating a priori information of the targets of the reaching movement. Our results show that the hidden-state model with target-conditioning further improves decoding accuracy.",

Recent advances in imaging techniques allow simultaneous access to various intracellular variables, and these data can be used to significantly facilitate the modelling task. These data, however, are noisy, and current approaches to building biophysically detailed models are not designed to deal with this. We extend previous techniques to take the noisy nature of the measurements into account. Sequential Monte Carlo (\"particle filtering\") methods, in combination with a detailed biophysical description of a cell, are used for principled, model-based smoothing of noisy recording data. We also provide an alternative formulation of smoothing where the neural nonlinearities are estimated in a non-parametric manner. Biophysically important parameters of detailed models (such as channel densities, intercompartmental conductances, input resistances, and observation noise) are inferred automatically from noisy data via expectation-maximization. Overall, we find that model-based smoothing is a powerful, robust technique for smoothing of noisy biophysical data and for inference of biophysical parameters in the face of recording noise.",

In this article, we describe fast methods for computing the exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) path of the hidden state variable in these models, given spike train observations. If the state transition density is log-concave and the observation model satisfies certain standard assumptions, then the optimization problem is strictly concave and can be solved rapidly with Newton-Raphson methods, because the Hessian of the loglikelihood is block tridiagonal. We can further exploit this block-tridiagonal structure to develop efficient parameter estimation methods for these models.

        "Abstract": "Signal-to-noise ratios in physical systems can be significantly degraded if the outputs of the systems are highly variable. Biological processes for which highly stereotyped signal generations are necessary features appear to have reduced their signal variabilities by employing multiple processing steps. To better understand why this multistep cascade structure might be desirable, we prove that the reliability of a signal generated by a multistate system with no memory (i.e., a Markov chain) is maximal if and only if the system topology is such that the process steps irreversibly through each state, with transition rates chosen such that an equal fraction of the total signal is generated in each state. Furthermore, our result indicates that by increasing the number of states, it is possible to arbitrarily increase the reliability of the system. In a physical system, however, an energy cost is associated with maintaining irreversible transitions, and this cost increases with the number of such transitions (i.e., the number of states). Thus, an infinite-length chain, which would be perfectly reliable, is infeasible. To model the effects of energy demands on the maximally reliable solution, we numerically optimize the topology under two distinct energy functions that penalize either irreversible transitions or incommunicability between states, respectively. In both cases, the solutions are essentially irreversible linear chains, but with upper bounds on the number of states set by the amount of available energy. We therefore conclude that a physical system for which signal reliability is important should employ a linear architecture, with the number of states (and thus the reliability) determined by the intrinsic energy constraints of the system.",

        "Abstract": "Experimental research seeking to quantify neuronal structure constantly contends with restrictions on image resolution and variability. In particular, experimentalists often need to analyze images with very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In many experiments, dye toxicity scales with the light intensity; this leads experimentalists to reduce image SNR in order to preserve the viability of the specimen. In this paper, we present a Bayesian approach for estimating the neuronal shape given low-SNR observations. This Bayesian framework has two major advantages. First, the method effectively incorporates known facts about 1) the image formation process, including blur and the Poisson nature of image noise at low intensities, and 2) dendritic shape, including the fact that dendrites are simply-connected geometric structures with smooth boundaries. Second, we may employ standard Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for quantifying the posterior uncertainty in our estimate of the dendritic shape. We describe an efficient computational implementation of these methods and demonstrate the algorithm's performance on simulated noisy two-photon laser-scanning microscopy images.",

        "Abstract": "Adaptively optimizing experiments has the potential to significantly reduce the number of trials needed to build parametric statistical models of neural systems. However, application of adaptive methods to neurophysiology has been limited by severe computational challenges. Since most neurons are high-dimensional systems, optimizing neurophysiology experiments requires computing high-dimensional integrations and optimizations in real time. Here we present a fast algorithm for choosing the most informative stimulus by maximizing the mutual information between the data and the unknown parameters of a generalized linear model (GLM) that we want to fit to the neuron's activity. We rely on important log concavity and asymptotic normality properties of the posterior to facilitate the required computations. Our algorithm requires only low-rank matrix manipulations and a two-dimensional search to choose the optimal stimulus. The average running time of these operations scales quadratically with the dimensionality of the GLM, making real-time adaptive experimental design feasible even for high-dimensional stimulus and parameter spaces. For example, we require roughly 10 milliseconds on a desktop computer to optimize a 100-dimensional stimulus. Despite using some approximations to make the algorithm efficient, our algorithm asymptotically decreases the uncertainty about the model parameters at a rate equal to the maximum rate predicted by an asymptotic analysis. Simulation results show that picking stimuli by maximizing the mutual information can speed up convergence to the optimal values of the parameters by an order of magnitude compared to using random (nonadaptive) stimuli. Finally, applying our design procedure to real neurophysiology experiments requires addressing the nonstationarities that we would expect to see in neural responses; our algorithm can efficiently handle both fast adaptation due to spike history effects and slow, nonsystematic drifts in a neuron's activity.",

        "Abstract": "Statistical dependencies in the responses of sensory neurons govern both the amount of stimulus information conveyed and the means by which downstream neurons can extract it. Although a variety of measurements indicate the existence of such dependencies, their origin and importance for neural coding are poorly understood. Here we analyse the functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spike responses. The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts 20% more information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40% more visual information than optimal linear decoding. This model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity in populations of neurons.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a class of models that predict how the instantaneous firing rate of a neuron depends on a dynamic stimulus. The models utilize a learnt pointwise nonlinear transform of the stimulus, followed by a linear filter that acts on the sequence of transformed inputs. In one case, the nonlinear transform is the same at all filter lag-times. Thus, this \"input nonlinearity\" converts the initial numerical representation of stimulus value to a new representation that provides optimal input to the subsequent linear model. We describe algorithms that estimate both the input nonlinearity and the linear weights simultaneously; and present techniques to regularise and quantify uncertainty in the estimates. In a second approach, the model is generalized to allow a different nonlinear transform of the stimulus value at each lag-time. Although more general, this model is algorithmically more straightforward to fit. However, it has many more degrees of freedom than the first approach, thus requiring more data for accurate estimation. We test the feasibility of these methods on synthetic data, and on responses from a neuron in rodent barrel cortex. The models are shown to predict responses to novel data accurately, and to recover several important neuronal response properties.",

        "Abstract": "Recent developments in multi-electrode recordings enable the simultaneous measurement of the spiking activity of many neurons. Analysis of such multineuronal data is one of the key challenge in computational neuroscience today. In this work, we develop a multivariate point-process model in which the observed activity of a network of neurons depends on three terms: (1) the experimentally-controlled stimulus; (2) the spiking history of the observed neurons; and (3) a hidden term that corresponds, for example, to common input from an unobserved population of neurons that is presynaptic to two or more cells in the observed population. We consider two models for the network firing-rates, one of which is computationally and analytically tractable but can lead to unrealistically high firing-rates, while the other with reasonable firing-rates imposes a greater computational burden. We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting the parameters of both the models. For the analytically tractable model the expectation step is based on a continuous-time implementation of the extended Kalman smoother, and the maximization step involves two concave maximization problems which may be solved in parallel. The other model that we consider necessitates the use of Monte Carlo methods for the expectation as well as maximization step. We discuss the trade-off involved in choosing between the two models and the associated methods. The techniques developed allow us to solve a variety of inference problems in a straightforward, computationally efficient fashion; for example, we may use the model to predict network activity given an arbitrary stimulus, infer a neuron's ring rate given the stimulus and the activity of the other observed neurons, and perform optimal stimulus decoding and prediction. We present several detailed simulation studies which explore the strengths and limitations of our approach.",

        "Abstract": "There are two basic problems in the statistical analysis of neural data. The \"encoding\" problem concerns how information is encoded in neural spike trains: can we predict the spike trains of a neuron (or population of neurons), given an arbitrary stimulus or observed motor response? Conversely, the \"decoding\" problem concerns how much information is in a spike train, in particular, how well can we estimate the stimulus that gave rise to the spike train? This chapter describes statistical model-based techniques that in some cases provide a unified solution to these two coding problems. These models can capture stimulus dependencies as well as spike history and interneuronal interaction effects in population spike trains, and are intimately related to biophysically based models of integrate-and-fire type. We describe flexible, powerful likelihood-based methods for fitting these encoding models and then for using the models to perform optimal decoding. Each of these (apparently quite difficult) tasks turn out to be highly computationally tractable, due to a key concavity property of the model likelihood. Finally, we return to the encoding problem to describe how to use these models to adaptively optimize the stimuli presented to the cell on a trial-by-trial basis, in order that we may infer the optimal model parameters as efficiently as possible.",

The key component of this method involves the likelihood that the model will emit a spike at a given time t. Computing this likelihood is equivalent to computing a Markov first passage time density (the probability that the model voltage crosses threshold for the first time at time t). Here we detail an improved method for computing this likelihood, based on solving a certain integral equation. This integral equation method has several advantages over the techniques discussed in our previous work: in particular, the new method has fewer free parameters and is easily differentiable (for gradient computations). The new method is also easily adaptable for the case in which the model conductance, not just the input current, is time-varying. Finally, we describe how to incorporate large deviations approximations to very small likelihoods.",

The computation is based on techniques from the theory of renewal processes and continuous-time hidden Markov processes (e.g., the backward and forward Fokker-Planck partial differential equations associated with first-passage time densities). From the STA voltage, it is straightforward to derive the STA input current. The theory also gives an explicit asymptotic approximation for the STA of the leaky IF cell, valid in the low-noise regime sigma --> 0. We consider both the STA and the conditional average voltage given an observed spike \"doublet\" event, that is, two spikes separated by some fixed period of silence. In each case, we find that the STA as a function of time-preceding-spike, tau, has a square root singularity as tau approaches zero from below and scales linearly with the scale of injected noise current. We close by briefly examining the discrete-time case, where similar phenomena are observed.",

        "Abstract": "The activity of neurons in primary motor cortex (M1) and cerebellum is known to correlate with extrinsic movement parameters, including hand position and velocity. Relatively few studies have addressed the encoding of intrinsic parameters, such as muscle activity. Here we applied a generalized regression analysis to describe the relationship of neurons in M1 and cerebellar dentate nucleus to electromyographic (EMG) activity from hand and forearm muscles, during performance of precision grip by macaque monkeys. We showed that cells in both M1 and dentate encode muscle activity in a linear fashion, and that EMG signals provide predictions of neural discharge that are equally accurate to those from kinematic information under these task conditions. Neural activity in M1 was significantly more correlated with both EMG and kinematic signals than was activity in dentate nucleus. Furthermore, the analysis enabled us to look at the temporal properties of muscle encoding. Cells were broadly tuned to muscle activity as a function of the lag between spiking and EMG and there was considerable heterogeneity in the optimal delay among individual neurons. However, a single lag (40 ms) was generally sufficient to provide good fits. Finally, incorporating spike history effects in our model offered no advantage in predicting novel spike trains, reinforcing the simple nature of the muscle encoding that we observed here.",

        "Abstract": "We develop theory and numerical methods for computing the most likely subthreshold voltage path of a noisy integrate-and-fire (IF) neuron, given observations of the neuron's superthreshold spiking activity. This optimal voltage path satisfies a second-order ordinary differential (Euler-Lagrange) equation which may be solved analytically in a number of special cases, and which may be solved numerically in general via a simple \"shooting\" algorithm. Our results are applicable for both linear and nonlinear subthreshold dynamics, and in certain cases may be extended to correlated subthreshold noise sources. We also show how this optimal voltage may be used to obtain approximations to (1) the likelihood that an IF cell with a given set of parameters was responsible for the observed spike train; and (2) the instantaneous firing rate and interspike interval distribution of a given noisy IF cell. The latter probability approximations are based on the classical Freidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations principles for stochastic differential equations. We close by comparing this most likely voltage path to the true observed subthreshold voltage trace in a case when intracellular voltage recordings are available in vitro.",

        "Abstract": "Biophysically accurate multicompartmental models of individual neurons have significantly advanced our understanding of the input-output function of single cells. These models depend on a large number of parameters that are difficult to estimate. In practice, they are often hand-tuned to match measured physiological behaviors, thus raising questions of identifiability and interpretability. We propose a statistical approach to the automatic estimation of various biologically relevant parameters, including 1) the distribution of channel densities, 2) the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic input, and 3) axial resistances across extended dendrites. Recent experimental advances, notably in voltage-sensitive imaging, motivate us to assume access to: i) the spatiotemporal voltage signal in the dendrite and ii) an approximate description of the channel kinetics of interest. We show here that, given i and ii, parameters 1-3 can be inferred simultaneously by nonnegative linear regression; that this optimization problem possesses a unique solution and is guaranteed to converge despite the large number of parameters and their complex nonlinear interaction; and that standard optimization algorithms efficiently reach this optimum with modest computational and data requirements. We demonstrate that the method leads to accurate estimations on a wide variety of challenging model data sets that include up to about 10(4) parameters (roughly two orders of magnitude more than previously feasible) and describe how the method gives insights into the functional interaction of groups of channels.",

        "Abstract": "Sensory encoding in spiking neurons depends on both the integration of sensory inputs and the intrinsic dynamics and variability of spike generation. We show that the stimulus selectivity, reliability, and timing precision of primate retinal ganglion cell (RGC) light responses can be reproduced accurately with a simple model consisting of a leaky integrate-and-fire spike generator driven by a linearly filtered stimulus, a postspike current, and a Gaussian noise current. We fit model parameters for individual RGCs by maximizing the likelihood of observed spike responses to a stochastic visual stimulus. Although compact, the fitted model predicts the detailed time structure of responses to novel stimuli, accurately capturing the interaction between the spiking history and sensory stimulus selectivity. The model also accounts for the variability in responses to repeated stimuli, even when fit to data from a single (nonrepeating) stimulus sequence. Finally, the model can be used to derive an explicit, maximum-likelihood decoding rule for neural spike trains, thus providing a tool for assessing the limitations that spiking variability imposes on sensory performance.",

        "Abstract": "A number of studies of the motor system suggest that the majority of primary motor cortical neurons represent simple movement-related kinematic and dynamic quantities in their time-varying activity patterns. An example of such an encoding relationship is the cosine tuning of firing rate with respect to the direction of hand motion. We present a systematic development of statistical encoding models for movement-related motor neurons using multielectrode array recordings during a two-dimensional (2-D) continuous pursuit-tracking task. Our approach avoids massive averaging of responses by utilizing 2-D normalized occupancy plots, cascaded linear-nonlinear (LN) system models and a method for describing variability in discrete random systems. We found that the expected firing rate of most movement-related motor neurons is related to the kinematic values by a linear transformation, with a significant nonlinear distortion in about 1/3 of the neurons. The measured variability of the neural responses is markedly non-Poisson in many neurons and is well captured by a \"normalized-Gaussian\" statistical model that is defined and introduced here. The statistical model is seamlessly integrated into a nearly-optimal recursive method for decoding movement from neural responses based on a Sequential Monte Carlo filter.",

Our point of view is Bayesian and information-theoretic: on any given trial, we want to adaptively choose the input in such a way that the mutual information between the (unknown) state of the system and the (stochastic) output is maximal, given any prior information (including data collected on any previous trials). We prove a theorem that quantifies the effectiveness of this strategy and give a few illustrative examples comparing the performance of this adaptive technique to that of the more usual nonadaptive experimental design. In particular, we calculate the asymptotic efficiency of the information-maximization strategy and demonstrate that this method is in a well-defined sense never less efficient--and is generically more efficient--than the nonadaptive strategy. For example, we are able to explicitly calculate the asymptotic relative efficiency of the staircase method widely employed in psychophysics research and to demonstrate the dependence of this efficiency on the form of the psychometric function underlying the output responses.",

We investigate the shape of the likelihood function for this type of model, give a simple condition on the nonlinearity ensuring that no non-global local maxima exist in the likelihood-leading, in turn, to efficient algorithms for the computation of the maximum likelihood estimator-and discuss the implications for the form of the allowed nonlinearities.

We describe the maximum likelihood estimator for the model parameters, given only extracellular spike train responses (not intracellular voltage data).

        "Abstract": "Neural activity in primary motor cortex (MI) is known to correlate with hand position and velocity. Previous descriptions of this tuning have (1) been linear in position or velocity, (2) depended only instantaneously on these signals, and/or (3) not incorporated the effects of interneuronal dependencies on firing rate. We show here that many MI cells encode a superlinear function of the full time-varying hand trajectory. Approximately 20% of MI cells carry information in the hand trajectory beyond just the position, velocity, and acceleration at a single time lag. Moreover, approximately one-third of MI cells encode the trajectory in a significantly superlinear manner; as one consequence, even small position changes can dramatically modulate the gain of the velocity tuning of MI cells, in agreement with recent psychophysical evidence. We introduce a compact nonlinear \"preferred trajectory\" model that predicts the complex structure of the spatiotemporal tuning functions described in previous work. Finally, observing the activity of neighboring cells in the MI network significantly increases the predictability of the firing rate of a single MI cell; however, we find interneuronal dependencies in MI to be much more locked to external kinematic parameters than those described recently in the hippocampus. Nevertheless, this neighbor activity is approximately as informative as the hand velocity, supporting the view that neural encoding in MI is best understood at a population level.",

        "Title": "Spatiotemporal tuning of motor cortical neurons for hand position and velocity.",
        "Abstract": "A pursuit-tracking task (PTT) and multielectrode recordings were used to investigate the spatiotemporal encoding of hand position and velocity in primate primary motor cortex (MI). Continuous tracking of a randomly moving visual stimulus provided a broad sample of velocity and position space, reduced statistical dependencies between kinematic variables, and minimized the nonstationarities that are found in typical \"step-tracking\" tasks. These statistical features permitted the application of signal-processing and information-theoretic tools for the analysis of neural encoding. The multielectrode method allowed for the comparison of tuning functions among simultaneously recorded cells. During tracking, MI neurons showed heterogeneity of position and velocity coding, with markedly different temporal dynamics for each. Velocity-tuned neurons were approximately sinusoidally tuned for direction, with linear speed scaling; other cells showed sinusoidal tuning for position, with linear scaling by distance. Velocity encoding led behavior by about 100 ms for most cells, whereas position tuning was more broadly distributed, with leads and lags suggestive of both feedforward and feedback coding. Individual cells encoded velocity and position weakly, with comparable amounts of information about each. Linear regression methods confirmed that random, 2-D hand trajectories can be reconstructed from the firing of small ensembles of randomly selected neurons (3-19 cells) within the MI arm area. These findings demonstrate that MI carries information about evolving hand trajectory during visually guided pursuit tracking, including information about arm position both during and after its specification. However, the reconstruction methods used here capture only the low-frequency components of movement during the PTT. Hand motion signals appear to be represented as a distributed code in which diverse information about position and velocity is available within small regions of MI.",

        "Abstract": "We analyse the convergence properties of three spike-triggered data analysis techniques. Our results are obtained in the setting of a probabilistic linear-nonlinear (LN) cascade neural encoding model; this model has recently become popular in the study of the neural coding of natural signals. We start by giving exact rate-of-convergence results for the common spike-triggered average technique. Next, we analyse a spike-triggered covariance method, variants of which have been recently exploited successfully by Bialek, Simoncelli and colleagues. Unfortunately, the conditions that guarantee that these two estimators will converge to the correct parameters are typically not satisfied by natural signal data. Therefore, we introduce an estimator for the LN model parameters which is designed to converge under general conditions to the correct model. We derive the rate of convergence of this estimator, provide an algorithm for its computation and demonstrate its application to simulated data as well as physiological data from the primary motor cortex of awake behaving monkeys. We also give lower bounds on the convergence rate of any possible LN estimator. Our results should prove useful in the study of the neural coding of high-dimensional natural signals.",

        "Abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that sequential movements are represented in the correlated activity of motor cortical neurons. We simultaneously recorded multiple single neurons in the motor cortex while monkeys performed a two-segment movement sequence. Before any movement began the correlated spike firing between pairs of neurons differed when these sequences were planned as whole (planned) as compared to when they were planned one segment at a time (unplanned) even when the firing rates of these neurons did not distinguish between the two conditions. Moreover, the correlation strength was significantly larger when the directional preferences of the neurons matched the direction of the final segment of the sequence. Our results suggest that spatially distributed groups of MI neurons form dynamic correlation structures that distinguish different forms of sequential action.",

        "Title": "Robustness of neuroprosthetic decoding algorithms.",
        "Abstract": "We assessed the ability of two algorithms to predict hand kinematics from neural activity as a function of the amount of data used to determine the algorithm parameters. Using chronically implanted intracortical arrays, single- and multineuron discharge was recorded during trained step tracking and slow continuous tracking tasks in macaque monkeys. The effect of increasing the amount of data used to build a neural decoding model on the ability of that model to predict hand kinematics accurately was examined. We evaluated how well a maximum-likelihood model classified discrete reaching directions and how well a linear filter model reconstructed continuous hand positions over time within and across days. For each of these two models we asked two questions: (1) How does classification performance change as the amount of data the model is built upon increases? (2) How does varying the time interval between the data used to build the model and the data used to test the model affect reconstruction? Less than 1 min of data for the discrete task (8 to 13 neurons) and less than 3 min (8 to 18 neurons) for the continuous task were required to build optimal models. Optimal performance was defined by a cost function we derived that reflects both the ability of the model to predict kinematics accurately and the cost of taking more time to build such models. For both the maximum-likelihood classifier and the linear filter model, increasing the duration between the time of building and testing the model within a day did not cause any significant trend of degradation or improvement in performance. Linear filters built on one day and tested on neural data on a subsequent day generated error-measure distributions that were not significantly different from those generated when the linear filters were tested on neural data from the initial day (p<0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). These data show that only a small amount of data from a limited number of cortical neurons appears to be necessary to construct robust models to predict kinematic parameters for the subsequent hours. Motor-control signals derived from neurons in motor cortex can be reliably acquired for use in neural prosthetic devices. Adequate decoding models can be built rapidly from small numbers of cells and maintained with daily calibration sessions.",

Here we show how activity from a few (7-30) MI neurons can be decoded into a signal that a monkey is able to use immediately to move a computer cursor to any new position in its workspace (14 degrees x 14 degrees visual angle). Our results, which are based on recordings made by an electrode array that is suitable for human use, indicate that neurally based control of movement may eventually be feasible in paralysed humans.",
