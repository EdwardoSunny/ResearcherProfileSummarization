Here we show that DRT2 systems encode an unprecedented immune pathway that involves de novo gene synthesis via rolling circle reverse transcription of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Programmed template jumping on the ncRNA generates a concatemeric cDNA, which becomes double-stranded upon viral infection. Remarkably, this DNA product constitutes a protein-coding, nearly endless ORF (",

Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this immune strategy by instead leveraging DNA synthesis, but the identities and functions of their DNA products remain largely unknown. Here we show that DRT2 systems execute an unprecedented immunity mechanism that involves de novo gene synthesis via rolling-circle reverse transcription of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Unbiased profiling of RT-associated RNA and DNA ligands in DRT2-expressing cells revealed that reverse transcription generates concatenated cDNA repeats through programmed template jumping on the ncRNA. The presence of phage then triggers second-strand cDNA synthesis, leading to the production of long double-stranded DNA. Remarkably, this DNA product is efficiently transcribed, generating messenger RNAs that encode a stop codon-less, never-ending ORF (",

        "Abstract": "Whole-genome sequencing of longitudinal tumor pairs representing transformation of follicular lymphoma to high-grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements (double-hit lymphoma) identified coding and noncoding genomic alterations acquired during lymphoma progression. Many of these transformation-associated alterations recurrently and focally occur at topologically associating domain resident regulatory DNA elements, including H3K4me3 promoter marks located within H3K27ac super-enhancer clusters in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. One region found to undergo recurrent alteration upon transformation overlaps a super-enhancer affecting the expression of the PAX5/ZCCHC7 gene pair. ZCCHC7 encodes a subunit of the Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4 polyadenylation-like complex and demonstrated copy number gain, chromosomal translocation and enhancer retargeting-mediated transcriptional upregulation upon lymphoma transformation. Consequently, lymphoma cells demonstrate nucleolar dysregulation via altered noncoding 5.8S ribosomal RNA processing. We find that a noncoding mutation acquired during lymphoma progression affects noncoding rRNA processing, thereby rewiring protein synthesis leading to oncogenic changes in the lymphoma proteome.",

        "Abstract": "Amyloid-like protein assemblies have been associated with toxic phenotypes because of their repetitive and stable structure. However, evidence that cells exploit these structures to control function and activity of some proteins in response to stimuli has questioned this paradigm. How amyloid-like assembly can confer emergent functions and how cells couple assembly with environmental conditions remains unclear. Here, we study Rim4, an RNA-binding protein that forms translation-repressing assemblies during yeast meiosis. We demonstrate that in its assembled and repressive state, Rim4 binds RNA more efficiently than in its monomeric and idle state, revealing a causal connection between assembly and function. The Rim4-binding site location within the transcript dictates whether the assemblies can repress translation, underscoring the importance of the architecture of this RNA-protein structure for function. Rim4 assembly depends exclusively on its intrinsically disordered region and is prevented by the Ras/protein kinase A signaling pathway, which promotes growth and suppresses meiotic entry in yeast. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby cells couple a functional protein assembly with a stimulus to enforce a cell fate decision.",

        "Title": "Rie1 and Sgn1 form an RNA-binding complex that enforces the meiotic entry cell fate decision.",
        "Abstract": "Budding yeast cells have the capacity to adopt few but distinct physiological states depending on environmental conditions. Vegetative cells proliferate rapidly by budding while spores can survive prolonged periods of nutrient deprivation and/or desiccation. Whether or not a yeast cell will enter meiosis and sporulate represents a critical decision that could be lethal if made in error. Most cell fate decisions, including those of yeast, are understood as being triggered by the activation of master transcription factors. However, mechanisms that enforce cell fates posttranscriptionally have been more difficult to attain. Here, we perform a forward genetic screen to determine RNA-binding proteins that affect meiotic entry at the posttranscriptional level. Our screen revealed several candidates with meiotic entry phenotypes, the most significant being RIE1, which encodes an RRM-containing protein. We demonstrate that Rie1 binds RNA, is associated with the translational machinery, and acts posttranscriptionally to enhance protein levels of the master transcription factor Ime1 in sporulation conditions. We also identified a physical binding partner of Rie1, Sgn1, which is another RRM-containing protein that plays a role in timely Ime1 expression. We demonstrate that these proteins act independently of cell size regulation pathways to promote meiotic entry. We propose a model explaining how constitutively expressed RNA-binding proteins, such as Rie1 and Sgn1, can act in cell fate decisions both as switch-like enforcers and as repressors of spurious cell fate activation.",

        "Abstract": "Amyloids are fibrous protein aggregates associated with age-related diseases. While these aggregates are typically described as irreversible and pathogenic, some cells use reversible amyloid-like structures that serve important functions. The RNA-binding protein Rim4 forms amyloid-like assemblies that are essential for translational control during Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiosis. Rim4 amyloid-like assemblies are disassembled in a phosphorylation-dependent manner at meiosis II onset. By investigating Rim4 clearance, we elucidate co-factors that mediate clearance of amyloid-like assemblies in a physiological setting. We demonstrate that yeast 14-3-3 proteins bind to Rim4 assemblies and facilitate their subsequent phosphorylation and timely clearance. Furthermore, distinct 14-3-3 proteins play non-redundant roles in facilitating phosphorylation and clearance of amyloid-like Rim4. Additionally, we find that 14-3-3 proteins contribute to global protein aggregate homeostasis. Based on the role of 14-3-3 proteins in aggregate homeostasis and their interactions with disease-associated assemblies, we propose that these proteins may protect against pathological protein aggregates.",

        "Abstract": "The initiation of the cell division process of meiosis requires exogenous signals that activate internal gene regulatory networks. Meiotic commitment ensures the irreversible continuation of meiosis, even upon withdrawal of the meiosis-inducing signals. A loss of meiotic commitment can cause highly abnormal polyploid cells and can ultimately lead to germ cell tumors. Despite the importance of meiotic commitment, only a few genes involved in commitment are known. In this study, we have discovered six new regulators of meiotic commitment in budding yeast: the Bcy1 protein involved in nutrient sensing, the meiosis-specific kinase Ime2, Polo kinase Cdc5, RNA-binding protein Pes4, and the 14-3-3 proteins Bmh1 and Bmh2. Decreased levels of these proteins cause a failure to establish or maintain meiotic commitment. Importantly, we found that Bmh1 and Bmh2 are involved in multiple processes throughout meiosis and in meiotic commitment. First, cells depleted of both Bmh1 and Bmh2 trigger the pachytene checkpoint, likely due to a role in DNA double-strand break repair. Second, Bmh1 interacts directly with the middle meiosis transcription factor Ndt80, and both Bmh1 and Bmh2 maintain Ndt80 levels. Third, Bmh1 and Bmh2 bind to Cdc5 and enhance its kinase activity. Finally, Bmh1 binds to Pes4, which regulates the timing of the translation of several mRNAs in meiosis II and is required to maintain meiotic commitment. Our results demonstrate that meiotic commitment is actively maintained throughout meiosis, with the 14-3-3 proteins and Polo kinase serving as key regulators of this developmental program.",

        "Abstract": "The epigenetic landscape of a cell frequently changes in response to fluctuations in nutrient levels, but the mechanistic link is not well understood. In fission yeast, the JmjC domain protein Epe1 is critical for maintaining the heterochromatin landscape. While loss of Epe1 results in heterochromatin expansion, overexpression of Epe1 leads to defective heterochromatin. Through a genetic screen, we found that mutations in genes of the cAMP signaling pathway suppress the heterochromatin defects associated with Epe1 overexpression. We further demonstrated that the activation of Pka1, the downstream effector of cAMP signaling, is required for the efficient translation of epe1+ mRNA to maintain Epe1 overexpression. Moreover, inactivation of the cAMP-signaling pathway, either through genetic mutations or glucose deprivation, leads to the reduction of endogenous Epe1 and corresponding heterochromatin changes. These results reveal the mechanism by which the cAMP signaling pathway regulates heterochromatin landscape in fission yeast.",

        "Abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) is a Gram-negative oral commensal, prevalent in various human diseases. It is unknown how this common commensal converts to a rampant pathogen. We report that Fn secretes an adhesin (FadA) with amyloid properties via a Fap2-like autotransporter to enhance its virulence. The extracellular FadA binds Congo Red, Thioflavin-T, and antibodies raised against human amyloid \u03b242. Fn produces amyloid-like FadA under stress and disease conditions, but not in healthy sites or tissues. It functions as a scaffold for biofilm formation, confers acid tolerance, and mediates Fn binding to host cells. Furthermore, amyloid-like FadA induces periodontal bone loss and promotes CRC progression in mice, with virulence attenuated by amyloid-binding compounds. The uncleaved signal peptide of FadA is required for the formation and stability of mature amyloid FadA fibrils. We propose a model in which hydrophobic signal peptides serve as \"hooks\" to crosslink neighboring FadA filaments to form a stable amyloid-like structure. Our study provides a potential mechanistic link between periodontal disease and CRC and suggests anti-amyloid therapies as possible interventions for Fn-mediated disease processes.",

        "Abstract": "Most RNA-binding modules are small and bind few nucleotides. RNA-binding proteins typically attain the physiological specificity and affinity for their RNA targets by combining several RNA-binding modules. Here, we review how disordered linkers connecting RNA-binding modules govern the specificity and affinity of RNA-protein interactions by regulating the effective concentration of these modules and their relative orientation. RNA-binding proteins also often contain extended intrinsically disordered regions that mediate protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions with multiple partners. We discuss how these regions can connect proteins and RNA resulting in heterogeneous higher-order assemblies such as membrane-less compartments and amyloid-like structures that have the characteristics of multi-modular entities. The assembled state generates additional RNA-binding specificity and affinity properties that contribute to further the function of RNA-binding proteins within the cellular environment.",

        "Abstract": "Retrotransposon proliferation poses a threat to germline integrity. While retrotransposons must be activated in developing germ cells in order to survive and propagate, how they are selectively activated in the context of meiosis is unclear. We demonstrate that the transcriptional activation of Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposons and host defense are controlled by master meiotic regulators. We show that budding yeast Ty3/Gypsy co-opts binding sites of the essential meiotic transcription factor Ndt80 upstream of the integration site, thereby tightly linking its transcriptional activation to meiotic progression. We also elucidate how yeast cells thwart Ty3/Gypsy proliferation by blocking translation of the retrotransposon mRNA using amyloid-like assemblies of the RNA-binding protein Rim4. In mammals, several inactive Ty3/Gypsy elements are undergoing domestication. We show that mammals utilize equivalent master meiotic regulators (Stra8, Mybl1, Dazl) to regulate Ty3/Gypsy-derived genes in developing gametes. Our findings inform how genes that are evolving from retrotransposons can build upon existing regulatory networks during domestication.",

        "Abstract": "Phase separation of multivalent protein and RNA molecules enables cells the formation of reversible nonstoichiometric, membraneless assemblies. These assemblies, referred to as biomolecular condensates, help with the spatial organization and compartmentalization of cellular matter. Each biomolecular condensate is defined by a distinct macromolecular composition. Distinct condensates have distinct preferential locations within cells, and they are associated with distinct biological functions, including DNA replication, RNA metabolism, signal transduction, synaptic transmission, and stress response. Several proteins found in biomolecular condensates have also been implicated in disease, including Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and several types of cancer. Disease-associated mutations in these proteins have been found to affect the material properties of condensates as well as the driving forces for phase separation. Understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic forces driving the formation and dissolution of biomolecular condensates via spontaneous and driven phase separation is an important step in understanding the processes associated with biological regulation in health and disease.",

        "Abstract": "mRNA localization serves key functions in localized protein production, making it critical that the translation machinery itself is present at these locations. Here we show that translation factor mRNAs are localized to distinct granules within yeast cells. In contrast to many messenger RNP granules, such as processing bodies and stress granules, which contain translationally repressed mRNAs, these granules harbor translated mRNAs under active growth conditions. The granules require Pab1p for their integrity and are inherited by developing daughter cells in a She2p/She3p-dependent manner. These results point to a model where roughly half the mRNA for certain translation factors is specifically directed in granules or translation factories toward the tip of the developing daughter cell, where protein synthesis is most heavily required, which has particular implications for filamentous forms of growth. Such a feedforward mechanism would ensure adequate provision of the translation machinery where it is to be needed most over the coming growth cycle.",

        "Abstract": "Cellular differentiation involves remodeling cellular architecture to transform one cell type to another. By investigating mitochondrial dynamics during meiotic differentiation in budding yeast, we sought to understand how organelle morphogenesis is developmentally controlled in a system where regulators of differentiation and organelle architecture are known, but the interface between them remains unexplored. We analyzed the regulation of mitochondrial detachment from the cell cortex, a known meiotic alteration to mitochondrial morphology. We found that mitochondrial detachment is enabled by the programmed destruction of the mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum-cortex anchor (MECA), an organelle tether that bridges mitochondria and the plasma membrane. MECA regulation is governed by a meiotic transcription factor, Ndt80, which promotes the activation of a conserved kinase, Ime2. We further present evidence for Ime2-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of MECA in a temporally controlled manner. Our study defines a key mechanism that coordinates mitochondrial morphogenesis with the landmark events of meiosis and demonstrates that cells can developmentally regulate tethering to induce organelle remodeling.",

        "Abstract": "Amyloids are fibrous protein assemblies that are often described as irreversible and intrinsically pathogenic. However, yeast cells employ amyloid-like assemblies of the RNA-binding protein Rim4 to control translation during meiosis. Here, we show that multi-site phosphorylation of Rim4 is critical for its regulated disassembly and degradation and that failure to clear Rim4 assemblies interferes with meiotic progression. Furthermore, we identify the protein kinase Ime2 to bring about Rim4 clearance via phosphorylation of Rim4's intrinsically disordered region. Rim4 phosphorylation leads to reversal of its amyloid-like properties and degradation by the proteasome. Our data support a model in which a threshold amount of phosphorylation, rather than modification of critical residues, is required for Rim4 clearance. Our results further demonstrate that at least some amyloid-like assemblies are not as irreversible as previously thought. We propose that the natural pathways by which cells process these structures could be deployed to act on disease-related amyloids.",

        "Abstract": "Message-specific translational control is required for gametogenesis. In yeast, the RNA-binding protein Rim4 mediates translational repression of numerous mRNAs, including the B-type cyclin CLB3, which is essential for establishing the meiotic chromosome segregation pattern. Here, we show that Rim4 forms amyloid-like aggregates and that it is the amyloid-like form of Rim4 that is the active, translationally repressive form of the protein. Our data further show that Rim4 aggregation is a developmentally regulated process. Starvation induces the conversion of monomeric Rim4 into amyloid-like aggregates, thereby activating the protein to bring about repression of translation. At the onset of meiosis II, Rim4 aggregates are abruptly degraded allowing translation to commence. Although amyloids are best known for their role in the etiology of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and diabetes by forming toxic protein aggregates, our findings show that cells can utilize amyloid-like protein aggregates to function as central regulators of gametogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "During meiosis homologous chromosomes undergo crossover recombination. Sequence differences between homologs can locally inhibit crossovers. Despite this, nucleotide diversity and population-scaled recombination are positively correlated in eukaryote genomes. To investigate interactions between heterozygosity and recombination we crossed Arabidopsis lines carrying fluorescent crossover reporters to 32 diverse accessions and observed hybrids with significantly higher and lower crossovers than homozygotes. Using recombinant populations derived from these crosses we observed that heterozygous regions increase crossovers when juxtaposed with homozygous regions, which reciprocally decrease. Total crossovers measured by chiasmata were unchanged when heterozygosity was varied, consistent with homeostatic control. We tested the effects of heterozygosity in mutants where the balance of interfering and non-interfering crossover repair is altered. Crossover remodeling at homozygosity-heterozygosity junctions requires interference, and non-interfering repair is inefficient in heterozygous regions. As a consequence, heterozygous regions show stronger crossover interference. Our findings reveal how varying homolog polymorphism patterns can shape meiotic recombination.",

        "Abstract": "Production of haploid gametes from diploid progenitor cells is mediated by a specialized cell division, meiosis, where two divisions, meiosis I and II, follow a single S phase. Errors in progression from meiosis I to meiosis II lead to aneuploid and polyploid gametes, but the regulatory mechanisms controlling this transition are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved kinase Ime2 regulates the timing and order of the meiotic divisions by controlling translation. Ime2 coordinates translational activation of a cluster of genes at the meiosis I-meiosis II transition, including the critical determinant of the meiotic chromosome segregation pattern CLB3. We further show that Ime2 mediates translational control through the meiosis-specific RNA-binding protein Rim4. Rim4 inhibits translation of CLB3 during meiosis I by interacting with the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of CLB3. At the onset of meiosis II, Ime2 kinase activity rises and triggers a decrease in Rim4 protein levels, thereby alleviating translational repression. Our results elucidate a novel developmentally regulated translational control pathway that establishes the meiotic chromosome segregation pattern.",

        "Abstract": "Gene conversion, the non-reciprocal exchange of genetic information, is one of the potential products of meiotic recombination. It can shape genome structure by acting on repetitive DNA elements, influence allele frequencies at the population level, and is known to be implicated in human disease. But gene conversion is hard to detect directly except in organisms, like fungi, that group their gametes following meiosis. We have developed a novel visual assay that enables us to detect gene conversion events directly in the gametes of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Using this assay we measured gene conversion events across the genome of more than one million meioses and determined that the genome-wide average frequency is 3.5\u00d710(-4) conversions per locus per meiosis. We also detected significant locus-to-locus variation in conversion frequency but no intra-locus variation. Significantly, we found one locus on the short arm of chromosome 4 that experienced 3-fold to 6-fold more gene conversions than the other loci tested. Finally, we demonstrated that we could modulate conversion frequency by varying experimental conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Meiosis is a dynamic process during which chromosomes undergo condensation, pairing, crossing-over and disjunction. Stringent regulation of the distribution and quantity of meiotic crossovers is critical for proper chromosome segregation in many organisms. In humans, aberrant crossover placement and the failure to faithfully segregate meiotic chromosomes often results in severe genetic disorders such as Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome. In most sexually reproducing organisms, crossovers are more evenly spaced than would be expected from a random distribution. This phenomenon, termed interference, was first reported in the early 20(th) century by Drosophila geneticists and has been subsequently observed in a vast range of organisms from yeasts to humans. Yet, many questions regarding the behavior and mechanism of interference remain poorly understood. In this review, we examine results new and old, from a wide range of organisms, to begin to understand the progress and remaining challenges to understanding the fundamental unanswered questions regarding genetic interference.",

        "Abstract": "Meiosis halves the chromosome number because its two divisions follow a single round of DNA replication. This process involves two cell transitions, the transition from prophase to the first meiotic division (meiosis I) and the unique meiosis I to meiosis II transition. We show here that the A-type cyclin CYCA1;2/TAM plays a major role in both transitions in Arabidopsis. A series of tam mutants failed to enter meiosis II and thus produced diploid spores and functional diploid gametes. These diploid gametes had a recombined genotype produced through the single meiosis I division. In addition, by combining the tam-2 mutation with AtSpo11-1 and Atrec8, we obtained plants producing diploid gametes through a mitotic-like division that were genetically identical to their parents. Thus tam alleles displayed phenotypes very similar to that of the previously described osd1 mutant. Combining tam and osd1 mutations leads to a failure in the prophase to meiosis I transition during male meiosis and to the production of tetraploid spores and gametes. This suggests that TAM and OSD1 are involved in the control of both meiotic transitions.",

        "Abstract": "During meiosis, chromatin undergoes extensive changes to facilitate recombination, homolog pairing, and chromosome segregation. To investigate the relationship between chromatin organization and meiotic processes, we used formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) to map open chromatin during the transition from mitosis to meiosis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that meiosis-induced opening of chromatin is associated with meiotic DSB hotpots. The positive association between open chromatin and DSB hotspots is most prominent 3 h into meiosis, when the early meiotic genes DMC1 and HOP1 exhibit maximum transcription and the early recombination genes SPO11 and RAD51 are strongly up-regulated. While the degree of chromatin openness is positively associated with the occurrence of recombination hotspots, many hotspots occur outside of open chromatin. Of particular interest, many DSB hotspots that fell outside of meiotic open chromatin nonetheless occurred in chromatin that had recently been open during mitotic growth. Finally, we find evidence for meiosis-specific opening of chromatin at the regions adjacent to boundaries of subtelomeric sequences, which exhibit specific crossover control patterns hypothesized to be regulated by chromatin.",

Here, we describe a protocol for quickly generating large data sets that are amenable to CO interference analysis in the flowering plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. We employ a visual assay that utilizes transgenic marker constructs encoding pollen-expressed fluorescent proteins of three colors in the quartet mutant background. In this genetic background, male meiotic products--the pollen grains--remain physically attached thereby facilitating tetrad analysis. We have developed a library of mapped marker insertions that, when crossed together, create adjacent intervals that can be rapidly and simultaneously screened for COs. This assay system is capable of detecting and differentiating single COs as well as two-, three- and four-strand double COs. We also describe how to analyze the data that are produced by this method. To generate and score a double interval in a wild-type and mutant background using this protocol will take 22-27 weeks.",

        "Abstract": "MUS81 is conserved among plants, animals, and fungi and is known to be involved in mitotic DNA damage repair and meiotic recombination. Here we present a functional characterization of the Arabidopsis thaliana homolog AtMUS81, which has a role in both mitotic and meiotic cells. The AtMUS81 transcript is produced in all tissues, but is elevated greater than 9-fold in the anthers and its levels are increased in response to gamma radiation and methyl methanesulfonate treatment. An Atmus81 transfer-DNA insertion mutant shows increased sensitivity to a wide range of DNA-damaging agents, confirming its role in mitotically proliferating cells. To examine its role in meiosis, we employed a pollen tetrad-based visual assay. Data from genetic intervals on Chromosomes 1 and 3 show that Atmus81 mutants have a moderate decrease in meiotic recombination. Importantly, measurements of recombination in a pair of adjacent intervals on Chromosome 5 demonstrate that the remaining crossovers in Atmus81 are interference sensitive, and that interference levels in the Atmus81 mutant are significantly greater than those in wild type. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that AtMUS81 is involved in a secondary subset of meiotic crossovers that are interference insensitive.",

        "Abstract": "Recombination, in the form of cross-overs (COs) and gene conversion (GC), is a highly conserved feature of meiosis from fungi to mammals. Recombination helps ensure chromosome segregation and promotes allelic diversity. Lesions in the recombination machinery are often catastrophic for meiosis, resulting in sterility. We have developed a visual assay capable of detecting Cos and GCs and measuring CO interference in Arabidopsis thaliana. This flexible assay utilizes transgene constructs encoding pollen-expressed fluorescent proteins of three different colors in the qrt1 mutant background. By observing the segregation of the fluorescent alleles in 92,489 pollen tetrads, we demonstrate (i) a correlation between developmental position and CO frequency, (ii) a temperature dependence for CO frequency, (iii) the ability to detect meiotic GC events, and (iv) the ability to rapidly assess CO interference.",
