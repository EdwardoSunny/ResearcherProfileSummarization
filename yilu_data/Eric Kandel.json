        "Abstract": "Biomolecular condensates, membraneless organelles found throughout the cell, play critical roles in many aspects of cellular function. Ribonucleoprotein granules (RNPs) are a type of biomolecular condensate necessary for local protein synthesis and are involved in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. Most of the proteins in RNPs possess low-complexity motifs (LCM), allowing for increased promiscuity of protein-protein interactions. Here, we describe the importance of protein-protein interactions mediated by the LCM of RNA-binding protein cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 3 (CPEB3). CPEB3 is necessary for long-term synaptic plasticity and memory persistence, but the mechanisms involved are still not completely elucidated. We now present key mechanisms involved in its regulation of synaptic plasticity. We find that CPEB3-LCM plays a role in appropriate local protein synthesis of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) targets, through crucial protein-protein interactions that drive localization to neuronal Decapping protein 1 (DCP1)-bodies. Translation-promoting CPEB3 and translation-inhibiting CPEB1 are packaged into neuronal RNP granules immediately after chemical long-term potentiation is induced, but only translation-promoting CPEB3 is repackaged to these organelles at later time points. This localization to neuronal RNP granules is critical for functional influence on translation as well as overall local protein synthesis (measured as \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) insertion into the membrane and localization to the synapse). We therefore conclude that protein-protein interaction between the LCM of CPEB3 plays a critical role in local protein synthesis by utilizing neuronal RNP granules.",

        "Abstract": "The regular use of cannabis during adolescence has been associated with a number of negative life outcomes, including psychopathology and cognitive impairments. However, the exact molecular mechanisms that underlie these outcomes are just beginning to be understood. Moreover, very little is known about the spatio-temporal molecular changes that occur following cannabinoid exposure in adolescence. To understand these changes, we exposed mid-adolescent male rats to a synthetic cannabinoid (WIN 55,212-2 mesylate; WIN) and, following drug abstinence through late adolescence, we subjected the synaptosomal fractions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to proteomic analyses. A total of N = 487 differentially expressed proteins were found in WIN-exposed animals compared to controls. Gene ontology analyses revealed enrichment of terms related to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurotransmitter system. Among the top differentially expressed proteins was the synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein 1 (SYNGAP1). Using Western blotting experiments, we found that the WIN-induced upregulation of SYNGAP1 was spatio-temporal in nature, arising only in the synaptosomal fractions (not in the cytosol) and only following prolonged drug abstinence (not on abstinence day 1). Moreover, the SYNGAP1 changes were found to be specific to WIN-exposure in adolescence and not adulthood. Adolescent animals exposed to a natural cannabinoid (\u0394",

        "Abstract": "The hippocampus is essential for different forms of declarative memory, including social memory, the ability to recognize and remember a conspecific. Although recent studies identify the importance of the dorsal CA2 region of the hippocampus in social memory storage, little is known about its sources of social information. Because CA2, like other hippocampal regions, receives its major source of spatial and non-spatial information from the medial and lateral subdivisions of entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC), respectively, we investigated the importance of these inputs for social memory. Whereas MEC inputs to CA2 are dispensable, the direct inputs to CA2 from LEC are both selectively activated during social exploration and required for social memory. This selective behavioral role of LEC is reflected in the stronger excitatory drive it provides to CA2 compared with MEC. Thus, a direct LEC \u2192 CA2 circuit is tuned to convey social information that is critical for social memory.",

        "Abstract": "Optical clearing methods serve as powerful tools to study intact organs and neuronal circuits. We developed an aqueous clearing protocol, Fast 3D Clear, that relies on tetrahydrofuran for tissue delipidation and iohexol for clearing, such that tissues can be imaged under immersion oil in light-sheet imaging systems. Fast 3D Clear requires 3 days to achieve high transparency of adult and embryonic mouse tissues while maintaining their anatomical integrity and preserving a vast array of transgenic and viral/dye fluorophores. A unique advantage of Fast 3D Clear is its complete reversibility and thus compatibility with tissue sectioning and immunohistochemistry. Fast 3D Clear can be easily and quickly applied to a wide range of biomedical studies, facilitating the acquisition of high-resolution two- and three-dimensional images.",

        "Abstract": "The brain's ability to process complex information relies on the constant supply of energy through aerobic respiration by mitochondria. Neurons contain three anatomically distinct compartments-the soma, dendrites, and projecting axons-which have different energetic and biochemical requirements, as well as different mitochondrial morphologies in cultured systems. In this study, we apply quantitative three-dimensional electron microscopy to map mitochondrial network morphology and complexity in the mouse brain. We examine somatic, dendritic, and axonal mitochondria in the dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) of the mouse hippocampus, two subregions with distinct principal cell types and functions. We also establish compartment-specific differences in mitochondrial morphology across these cell types between young and old mice, highlighting differences in age-related morphological recalibrations. Overall, these data define the nature of the neuronal mitochondrial network in the mouse hippocampus, providing a foundation to examine the role of mitochondrial morpho-function in the aging brain.",

        "Abstract": "The hippocampus contains a diverse array of inhibitory interneurons that gate information flow through local cortico-hippocampal circuits to regulate memory storage. Although most studies of interneurons have focused on their role in fast synaptic inhibition mediated by GABA release, different classes of interneurons express unique sets of neuropeptides, many of which have been shown to exert powerful effects on neuronal function and memory when applied pharmacologically. However, relatively little is known about whether and how release of endogenous neuropeptides from inhibitory cells contributes to their behavioral role in regulating memory formation. Here we report that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons participate in social memory storage by enhancing information transfer from hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons to CA2 pyramidal neurons. Notably, this action depends on release of the neuropeptide enkephalin from VIP neurons, causing long-term depression of feedforward inhibition onto CA2 pyramidal cells. Moreover, VIP neuron activity in the CA2 region is increased selectively during exploration of a novel conspecific. Our findings, thus, enhance our appreciation of how GABAergic neurons can regulate synaptic plasticity and mnemonic behavior by demonstrating that such actions can be mediated by release of a specific neuropeptide, rather than through classic fast inhibitory transmission.",

        "Abstract": "Retinoid X receptors are members of the nuclear receptor family that regulate gene expression in response to retinoic acid and related ligands. Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors are G-protein coupled transmembrane receptors that activate intracellular signaling cascades in response to the neurotransmitter, glutamate. These two classes of molecules have been studied independently and found to play important roles in regulating neuronal physiology with potential clinical implications for disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that mice lacking the retinoid X receptor subunit, RXR\u03b3, exhibit impairments in group 1 mGluR-mediated electrophysiological responses at hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapses, including impaired group 1 mGluR-dependent long-term synaptic depression (LTD), reduced group 1 mGluR-induced calcium release, and loss of group 1 mGluR-activated voltage-sensitive currents. These animals also exhibit impairments in a subset of group 1 mGluR-dependent behaviors, including motor performance, spatial object recognition, and prepulse inhibition. Together, these observations demonstrate convergence between the RXR\u03b3 and group 1 mGluR signaling pathways that may function to coordinate their regulation of neuronal activity. They also identify RXR\u03b3 as a potential target for the treatment of disorders in which group 1 mGluR signaling has been implicated.",

        "Abstract": "The effects of social isolation on an individual's behavior is an important field of research, especially as public health officials encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of pandemic disease. In this study we evaluate the effects of social isolation on physical activity in mice. Utilizing a pixel-based tracking system, we continuously monitored the movement of isolated mice compared with paired cage mates in the home cage environment. We demonstrate that mice that are socially isolated dramatically decrease their movement when separated from their cage mate, and especially in the dark cycle, when mice are normally most active. When isolated mice are re-paired with their original cage mate, this effect is reversed, and mice return to their prior levels of activity. These findings suggest a close link between social isolation and physical activity, and are of particular interest in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019, when many are forced into isolation. Social isolation may affect an individual's overall activity levels in humans too, which may have unintended effects on health that deserve further consideration.",

TIA1 contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal low-complexity domain, sometimes referred to as a \"prion-related domain\" or associated with amyloid formation. Under mild conditions, full-length (fl) mouse TIA1 spontaneously oligomerizes to form a metastable colloid-like suspension. RRM2 and RRM3, known to be critical for function, are folded similarly in excised domains and this oligomeric form of apo fl TIA1, based on NMR chemical shifts. By contrast, the termini were not detected by NMR and are unlikely to be amyloid-like. We were able to assign the NMR shifts with the aid of previously assigned solution-state shifts for the RRM2,3 isolated domains and homology modeling. We present a micellar model of fl TIA1 wherein RRM2 and RRM3 are colocalized, ordered, hydrated, and available for nucleotide binding. At the same time, the termini are disordered and phase separated, reminiscent of stress granule substructure or nanoscale liquid droplets.",

        "Abstract": "Does abstract art evoke a different cognitive state than figurative art? To address this question empirically, we bridged art theory and cognitive research and designed an experiment leveraging construal level theory (CLT). CLT is based on experimental data showing that psychologically distant events (i.e., occurring farther away in space or time) are represented more abstractly than closer events. We measured construal level elicited by abstract vs. representational art and asked subjects to assign abstract/representational paintings by the same artist to a situation that was temporally/spatially near or distant. Across three experiments, we found that abstract paintings were assigned to the distant situation significantly more often than representational paintings, indicating that abstract art was evocative of greater psychological distance. Our data demonstrate that different levels of artistic abstraction evoke different levels of mental abstraction and suggest that CLT provides an empirical approach to the analysis of cognitive states evoked by different levels of artistic abstraction.",

        "Abstract": "A recurrent and devastating feature of addiction to a drug of abuse is its persistence, which is mediated by maladaptive long-term memories of the highly pleasurable experience initially associated with the consumption of the drug. We have recently found that members of the CPEB family of proteins (Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element-Binding Proteins) are involved in the maintenance of spatial memory. However, their possible role in the maintenance of memories that sustain addictive behavior has yet to be explored. Little is known about any of the mechanisms for maintaining memories for addictive behavior. To address the mechanisms whereby addictive behavior is maintained over time, we utilized a conditional transgenic mouse model expressing a dominant-negative version of CPEB1 that abolishes the activity in the forebrain of two of the four CPEB isoforms (CPEB1 and CPEB3). We found that, following cocaine administration, these dominant-negative (DN) CPEB mice showed a significant decrease, when compared to wild type (WT) mice, in both locomotor sensitizations and conditioned place preference (CPP), two indices of addictive behavior. Supporting these behavioral results, we also found a difference between WT and DN-CPEB1-3 mice in the cocaine-induced synaptic depression in the core of the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc). Finally, we found that (1) CPEB is reduced in transgenic mice following cocaine injections and that (2) FosB, known for its contribution to establishing the addictive phenotype, when its expression in the striatum is increased by drug administration, is a novel target of CPEBs molecules. Thus, our study highlights how CPEB1 and CPEB3 act on target mRNAs to build the neuroadaptative implicit memory responses that lead to the development of the cocaine addictive phenotypes in mammals.",

        "Abstract": "The initial response to an addictive substance can facilitate repeated use: That is, individuals experiencing more positive effects are more likely to use that drug again. Increasing evidence suggests that psychoactive cannabinoid use in adolescence enhances the behavioral effects of cocaine. However, despite the behavioral data, there is no neurobiological evidence demonstrating that cannabinoids can also alter the brain's initial molecular and epigenetic response to cocaine. Here, we utilized a multiomics approach (epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics) to characterize how the rat brain responds to its first encounter with cocaine, with or without preexposure to the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (WIN). We find that in adolescent (but not in adult) rats, preexposure to WIN results in cross-sensitization to cocaine, which correlates with histone hyperacetylation and decreased levels of HDAC6 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In the PFC, we also find that WIN preexposure blunts the typical mRNA response to cocaine and instead results in alternative splicing and chromatin accessibility events, involving genes such as ",

        "Abstract": "Long-term sensitization of the gill withdrawal reflex in Aplysia requires heterosynaptic, modulatory input that is mediated in part by the growth of new synaptic connections between sensory neurons and their follower cells (intrinsic mediating circuit). Whether modulatory interneurons (the extrinsic modulatory circuit) also display learning-related structural synaptic plasticity remains unknown. To test this idea, we added a bona fide serotonergic modulatory neuron, the metacerebral cell (MCC), to sensory-motor neuron co-cultures and examined the modulating presynaptic varicosities of MCCs before and after repeated pulses of serotonin (5-HT) that induced long-term facilitation (LTF). We observed robust growth of new serotonergic varicosities that were positive for serotonin and capable of synaptic recycling. Our findings demonstrate that, in addition to structural changes in the intrinsic mediating circuit, there are also significant learning-related structural changes in the extrinsic modulating circuit, and these changes might provide a cellular mechanism for savings and for spread of memory.",

In this article, we focus on ubiquitination and SUMOylation of amyloidogenic proteins. We discuss the functional contributions of PTMs on proteins involved in amyloid-related diseases as well as the aberrant PTM signatures of the disease agents. In addition, we extend our discussion to the nascent field of functional amyloids, a subclass of amyloids that perform physiological functions. Here, we present examples from mammals and yeast to gain insight into physiological regulation of amyloid-like proteins.",

        "Title": "CPEB3 inhibits translation of mRNA targets by localizing them to P bodies.",
        "Abstract": "Protein synthesis is crucial for the maintenance of long-term memory-related synaptic plasticity. The cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3) regulates the translation of several mRNAs important for long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. In previous studies, we found that the oligomerization and activity of CPEB3 are controlled by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation. In the basal state, CPEB3 is SUMOylated; it is soluble and acts as a repressor of translation. Following neuronal stimulation, CPEB3 is de-SUMOylated; it now forms oligomers that are converted into an active form that promotes the translation of target mRNAs. To better understand how CPEB3 regulates the translation of its mRNA targets, we have examined CPEB3 subcellular localization. We found that basal, repressive CPEB3 is localized to membraneless cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies), subcellular compartments that are enriched in translationally repressed mRNA. This basal state is affected by the SUMOylation state of CPEB3. After stimulation, CPEB3 is recruited into polysomes, thus promoting the translation of its target mRNAs. Interestingly, when we examined CPEB3 recombinant protein in vitro, we found that CPEB3 phase separates when SUMOylated and binds to a specific mRNA target. These findings suggest a model whereby SUMO regulates the distribution, oligomerization, and activity of oligomeric CPEB3, a critical player in the persistence of memory.",

        "Abstract": "The generalization of fear is adaptive in that it allows an animal to respond appropriately to novel threats that are not identical to previous experiences. In contrast, the overgeneralization of fear is maladaptive and is a hallmark of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a psychiatric illness that is characterized by chronic symptomatology and a higher incidence in women compared to men. Therefore, understanding the neural basis of fear generalization at remote time-points in female animals is of particular translational relevance. However, our understanding of the neurobiology of fear generalization is largely restricted to studies employing male mice and focusing on recent time-points (i.e., within 24-48 h following conditioning). To address these limitations, we examined how male and female mice generalize contextual fear at remote time intervals (i.e., 3 weeks after conditioning). In agreement with earlier studies of fear generalization at proximal time-points, we find that the test order of training and generalization contexts is a critical determinant of generalization and context discrimination, particularly for female mice. However, tactile elements that are present during fear conditioning are more salient for male mice. Our study highlights long-term sex differences in defensive behavior between male and female mice and may provide insight into sex differences in the processing and retrieval of remote fear memory observed in humans.",

        "Abstract": "TIA1 is a prion-related RNA-binding protein whose capacity to form various types of intracellular aggregates has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease. However, its role in normal brain function is poorly understood. Here, we show that TIA1 bidirectionally modulates stress-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in fear memory and olfactory discrimination learning. At the behavioral level, conditioned odor avoidance is potentiated by TIA1 deletion, whereas overexpression of TIA1 in the ventral hippocampus inhibits both contextual fear memory and avoidance. However, the latter genetic manipulations have little impact on other hippocampus-dependent tasks. Transcriptional profiling indicates that TIA1 presides over a large network of immune system genes with modulatory roles in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. Our results uncover a physiological and partly sex-dependent function for TIA1 in fear memory and may provide molecular insight into stress-related psychiatric conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety.",

When confronted with a potential threat, an animal must select an appropriate defensive response based on previous experiences that are not identical, weighing cues and contextual information that may predict safety or danger. Like other aspects of fear memory, generalization is mediated by the coordinated actions of prefrontal, hippocampal, amygdalar, and thalamic brain areas. In this review article, we describe the current understanding of the behavioral, neural, genetic, and biochemical mechanisms involved in the generalization of fear. Fear generalization is a hallmark of many anxiety and stress-related disorders, and its emergence, severity, and manifestation are sex-dependent. Therefore, to improve the dialog between human and animal studies as well as to accelerate the development of effective therapeutics, we emphasize the need to examine both sex differences and remote timescales in rodent models.",

        "Abstract": "Although the hippocampus is known to be important for declarative memory, it is less clear how hippocampal output regulates motivated behaviours, such as social aggression. Here we report that pyramidal neurons in the CA2 region of the hippocampus, which are important for social memory, promote social aggression in mice. This action depends on output from CA2 to the lateral septum, which is selectively enhanced immediately before an attack. Activation of the lateral septum by CA2 recruits a circuit that disinhibits a subnucleus of the ventromedial hypothalamus that is known to trigger attack. The social hormone arginine vasopressin enhances social aggression by acting on arginine vasopressin 1b receptors on CA2 presynaptic terminals in the lateral septum to facilitate excitatory synaptic transmission. In this manner, release of arginine vasopressin in the lateral septum, driven by an animal's internal state, may serve as a modulatory control that determines whether CA2 activity leads to declarative memory of a social encounter and/or promotes motivated social aggression.",

        "Abstract": "Over the past half-century, we have gained significant insights into the molecular biology of long-term memory storage at the level of the synapse. In recent years, our understanding of the cellular architecture supporting long-term memory traces has also substantially improved. However, the molecular biology of consolidation at the level of neuronal systems has been relatively neglected. In this opinion article, we first examine our current understanding of the cellular mechanisms of synaptic consolidation. We then outline areas requiring further investigation on how cellular changes contribute to systems consolidation. Finally, we highlight recent findings on the cellular architecture of memory traces in rodents and how the application of new technologies will expand our understanding of systems consolidation at the neural circuit level. In the coming years, this research focus will be critical for understanding the evolution of long-term memories and for enabling the development of novel therapeutics which embrace the dynamic nature of memories.",

        "Abstract": "Precisely deciphering the molecular mechanisms of age-related memory loss is crucial to create appropriate therapeutic interventions. We have previously shown that the histone-binding protein RbAp48/Rbbp4 is a molecular determinant of Age-Related Memory Loss. By exploring how this protein regulates the genomic landscape of the hippocampal circuit, we find that RbAp48 controls the expression of BDNF and GPR158 proteins, both critical components of osteocalcin (OCN) signaling in the mouse hippocampus. We show that inhibition of RbAp48 in the hippocampal formation inhibits OCN's beneficial functions in cognition and causes deficits in discrimination memory. In turn, disruption of OCN/GPR158 signaling leads to the downregulation of RbAp48 protein, mimicking the discrimination memory deficits observed in the aged hippocampus. We also show that activation of the OCN/GPR158 pathway increases the expression of RbAp48 in the aged dentate gyrus and rescues age-related memory loss.",

        "Abstract": "Cannabis use is typically initiated during adolescence and is a significant risk factor for the development of cocaine use in adulthood. However, no preclinical studies have examined the effects of adolescent cannabinoid exposure on cocaine dependence in adulthood using the escalation model of cocaine self-administration and the assessment of negative emotional states. In the present study, we found that exposure to the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 (WIN) in adolescence produced irritability-like behavior and psychomotor cross-sensitization to cocaine in adolescence. In adulthood, rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine. The acquisition of cocaine self-administration was lower in rats with adolescent WIN exposure compared with controls. However, both WIN-exposed and control rats escalated their cocaine intake at the same rate, had similar responding under a progressive-ratio schedule of reinforcement, and had similar psychomotor responses to cocaine. Interestingly, the increase in irritability-like behavior that was previously observed in adolescence after WIN exposure persisted into adulthood. Whether the persisting increase in irritability-like behavior after WIN exposure has translational relevance remains to be studied. In summary, these results suggest that psychoactive cannabinoid exposure during adolescence is unlikely to have a major effect on the escalation of cocaine intake or the development of compulsive-like responding per se in adulthood in a rat model of cocaine self-administration. However, whether the persisting irritability-like behavior may predispose an individual to mood-related impairments in adulthood or predict such impairments warrants further investigation.",

        "Abstract": "Norepinephrine is a monoamine neurotransmitter with a wide repertoire of physiological roles in the peripheral and central nervous systems. There are, however, no experimental means to study functional properties of individual noradrenergic synapses in the brain. Development of new approaches for imaging synaptic neurotransmission is of fundamental importance to study specific synaptic changes that occur during learning, behavior, and pathological processes. Here, we introduce fluorescent false neurotransmitter 270 (FFN270), a fluorescent tracer of norepinephrine. As a fluorescent substrate of the norepinephrine and vesicular monoamine transporters, FFN270 labels noradrenergic neurons and their synaptic vesicles, and enables imaging synaptic vesicle content release from specific axonal sites in living rodents. Combining FFN270 imaging and optogenetic stimulation, we find heterogeneous release properties of noradrenergic synapses in the somatosensory cortex, including low and high releasing populations. Through systemic amphetamine administration, we observe rapid release of cortical noradrenergic vesicular content, providing insight into the drug's effect.",

        "Abstract": "The dopamine (DA) system plays a major role in cognitive functions through its interactions with several brain regions including the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Conversely, disturbances in the DA system contribute to cognitive deficits in psychiatric diseases, yet exactly how they do so remains poorly understood. Here we show, using mice with disease-relevant alterations in DA signaling (D2R-OE mice), that deficits in working memory (WM) are associated with impairments in the WM-dependent firing patterns of DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The WM-dependent phase-locking of DA neurons to 4\u2009Hz VTA-PFC oscillations is absent in D2R-OE mice and VTA-PFC synchrony deficits scale with their WM impairments. We also find reduced 4\u2009Hz synchrony between VTA DA neurons and selective impairments in their representation of WM demand. These results identify how altered DA neuron activity-at the level of long-range network activity and task-related firing patterns-may underlie cognitive impairments.",

        "Abstract": "Reduced eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 (eIF2)\u03b1 phosphorylation (p-eIF2\u03b1) enhances protein synthesis, memory formation, and addiction-like behaviors. However, p-eIF2\u03b1 has not been examined with regard to psychoactive cannabinoids and cross-sensitization. Here, we find that a cannabinoid receptor agonist\u00a0(WIN 55,212-2 mesylate [WIN]) reduced p-eIF2\u03b1 in\u00a0vitro by upregulating GADD34 (PPP1R15A), the\u00a0recruiter of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The induction of GADD34 was linked to ERK/CREB signaling and to CREB-binding protein (CBP)-mediated histone hyperacetylation at the Gadd34 locus. In\u00a0vitro, WIN also upregulated eIF2B1, an eIF2 activator subunit. We next found that WIN administration in\u00a0vivo reduced p-eIF2\u03b1 in the nucleus accumbens of\u00a0adolescent, but not adult, rats. By contrast, WIN increased dorsal striatal levels of eIF2B1 and \u0394FosB among both adolescents and adults. In addition, we\u00a0found cross-sensitization between WIN and cocaine only among adolescents. These findings show that cannabinoids can modulate eukaryotic initiation factors, and they suggest a possible link between p-eIF2\u03b1 and the gateway drug properties of psychoactive cannabinoids.",

        "Abstract": "Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T\u00a0cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN. Similarly, the formation and maintenance of TIA-1-positive stress granules in arsenite-treated cells are inhibited by TPEN. In addition, Zn",

        "Abstract": "Addiction to cocaine is commonly preceded by experiences with legal or decriminalized drugs, such as alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana. The biological mechanisms by which these gateway drugs contribute to cocaine addiction are only beginning to be understood. We report that in the rat, prior alcohol consumption results in enhanced addiction-like behavior to cocaine, including continued cocaine use despite aversive consequences. Conversely, prior cocaine use has no effect on alcohol preference. Long-term, but not short-term, alcohol consumption promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of the nuclear histone deacetylases HDAC4 and HDAC5 in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region critical for reward-based memory. Decreased nuclear HDAC activity results in global H3 acetylation, creating a permissive environment for cocaine-induced gene expression. We also find that selective degradation of HDAC4 and HDAC5, facilitated by the class II-specific HDAC inhibitor MC1568, enhances compulsive cocaine self-administration. These results parallel our previously reported findings that the gateway drug nicotine enhances the behavioral effects of cocaine via HDAC inhibition. Together, our findings suggest a shared mechanism of action for the gateway drugs alcohol and nicotine, and reveal a novel mechanism by which environmental factors may alter the epigenetic landscape of the reward system to increase vulnerability to cocaine addiction.",

One question is to determine whether OCN is also sufficient to improve these behaviors in wild-type mice, when circulating levels of OCN decline as they do with age. Here we show that the presence of OCN is necessary for the beneficial influence of plasma from young mice when injected into older mice on memory and that peripheral delivery of OCN is sufficient to improve memory and decrease anxiety-like behaviors in 16-mo-old mice. A second question is to identify a receptor transducing OCN signal in neurons. Genetic, electrophysiological, molecular, and behavioral assays identify ",

        "Abstract": "Prions are proteins that can adopt self-perpetuating conformations and are traditionally regarded as etiological agents of infectious neurodegenerative diseases in humans, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, and transmissible encephalopathies. More recently, a growing consensus has emerged that prion-like, self-templating mechanisms also underlie a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. Perhaps most surprising, not all prion-like aggregates are associated with pathological changes. There are now several examples of prion-like proteins in mammals that serve positive biological functions in their aggregated state. In this review, we discuss functional prions in the nervous system, with particular emphasis on the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB) and the role of its prion-like aggregates in synaptic plasticity and memory. We also mention a more recent example of a functional prion-like protein in the brain, TIA-1, and its role during stress. These studies of functional prion-like proteins have provided a number of generalizable insights on how prion-based protein switches may operate to serve physiological functions in higher eukaryotes.",

        "Abstract": "Prions are self-propagating protein conformations that are traditionally regarded as agents of neurodegenerative disease in animals. However, it has become evident that prion-like aggregation of endogenous proteins can also occur under normal physiological conditions (e.g., during memory storage or activation of the immune response). In this review, we focus on the functional prion-related protein TIA-1, an RNA-binding protein that is involved in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism but is best understood in terms of its role in stress granule assembly during the cellular stress response. We propose that stress granule formation provides a useful conceptual framework with which to address the positive role of TIA-1 prion-like aggregation. Elucidating the function of TIA-1 prion-like aggregation will advance our understanding of how prion-based molecular switches are used in normal physiological settings.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine neurotransmission in the dorsal hippocampus is critical for a range of functions from spatial learning and synaptic plasticity to the deficits underlying psychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is the presumed source of dopamine in the dorsal hippocampus. However, there is a surprising scarcity of VTA dopamine axons in the dorsal hippocampus despite the dense network of dopamine receptors. We have explored this apparent paradox using optogenetic, biochemical, and behavioral approaches and found that dopaminergic axons and subsequent dopamine release in the dorsal hippocampus originate from neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC). Photostimulation of LC axons produced an increase in dopamine release in the dorsal hippocampus as revealed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Furthermore, optogenetically induced release of dopamine from the LC into the dorsal hippocampus enhanced selective attention and spatial object recognition via the dopamine D1/D5 receptor. These results suggest that spatial learning and memory are energized by the release of dopamine in the dorsal hippocampus from noradrenergic neurons of the LC. The present findings are critical for identifying the neural circuits that enable proper attention selection and successful learning and memory.",

        "Abstract": "Two pharmacologically distinct types of local protein synthesis are required for synapse- specific long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF) in Aplysia: one for initiation and the other for maintenance. ApCPEB, a rapamycin sensitive prion-like molecule regulates a form of local protein synthesis that is specifically required for the maintenance of the LTF. However, the molecular component of the local protein synthesis that is required for the initiation of LTF and that is sensitive to emetine is not known. Here, we identify a homolog of ApCPEB responsible for the initiation of LTF. ApCPEB4 which we have named after its mammalian CPEB4-like homolog lacks a prion-like domain, is responsive to 5-hydroxytryptamine, and is translated (but not transcribed) in an emetine-sensitive, rapamycin-insensitive, and PKA-dependent manner. The ApCPEB4 binds to different target RNAs than does ApCPEB. Knock-down of ApCPEB4 blocked the induction of LTF, whereas overexpression of ApCPEB4 reduces the threshold of the formation of LTF. Thus, our findings suggest that the two different forms of CPEBs play distinct roles in LTF; ApCPEB is required for maintenance of LTF, whereas the ApCPEB4, which lacks a prion-like domain, is required for the initiation of LTF.",

They have been identified as the pathogenic agents, contributing to a number of diseases of the nervous system. However, the discovery that the neuronal RNA-binding protein, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB), has a prion-like state that is involved in the stabilization of memory raised the possibility that prion-like proteins can serve normal physiological functions in the nervous system. Here, we review recent experimental evidence of prion-like properties of neuronal CPEB in various organisms and propose a model of how the prion-like state may stabilize memory.",

        "Abstract": "Elevated levels of the \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) are thought to contribute to cognitive and behavioral impairments observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) participates in multiple molecular pathways implicated in AD, and its expression and activity are reduced in postmortem brains of AD patients. PP2A is regulated by protein methylation, and impaired PP2A methylation is thought to contribute to increased AD risk in hyperhomocysteinemic individuals. To examine further the link between PP2A and AD, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress the PP2A methylesterase, protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1), or the PP2A methyltransferase, leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1 (LCMT-1), and examined the sensitivity of these animals to behavioral and electrophysiological impairments caused by exogenous A\u03b2 exposure. We found that PME-1 overexpression enhanced these impairments, whereas LCMT-1 overexpression protected against A\u03b2-induced impairments. Neither transgene affected A\u03b2 production or the electrophysiological response to low concentrations of A\u03b2, suggesting that these manipulations selectively affect the pathological response to elevated A\u03b2 levels. Together these data identify a molecular mechanism linking PP2A to the development of AD-related cognitive impairments that might be therapeutically exploited to target selectively the pathological effects caused by elevated A\u03b2 levels in AD patients.",

        "Abstract": "GABAergic signaling in the amygdala controls learned fear, and its dysfunction potentially contributes to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We find that sub-threshold fear conditioning leads to dopamine receptor D4-dependent long-term depression (LTD) of glutamatergic excitatory synapses by increasing inhibitory inputs onto neurons of the dorsal intercalated cell mass (ITC) in the amygdala. Pharmacological, genetic, and optogenetic manipulations of the amygdala regions centered on the dorsal ITC reveal that this LTD limits less salient experiences from forming persistent memories. In further support of the idea that LTD has preventive and discriminative roles, we find that LTD at the dorsal ITC is impaired in mice exhibiting PTSD-like behaviors. These findings reveal a novel role of inhibitory circuits in the amygdala, which serves to dampen and restrict the level of fear expression. This mechanism is interfered with by stimuli that give rise to PTSD and may also be recruited for fear-related psychiatric diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Increasing motivation can positively impact cognitive performance. Here we employed a cognitive timing task that allows us to detect changes in cognitive performance that are not influenced by general activity or arousal factors such as the speed or persistence of responding. This approach allowed us to manipulate motivation using three different methods; molecular/genetic, behavioral and pharmacological. Increased striatal D2Rs resulted in deficits in temporal discrimination. Switching off the transgene improved motivation in earlier studies, and here partially rescued the temporal discrimination deficit. To manipulate motivation behaviorally, we altered reward magnitude and found that increasing reward magnitude improved timing in control mice and partially rescued timing in the transgenic mice. Lastly, we manipulated motivation pharmacologically using a functionally selective 5-HT2C receptor ligand, SB242084, which we previously found to increase incentive motivation. SB242084 improved temporal discrimination in both control and transgenic mice. Thus, while there is a general intuitive belief that motivation can affect cognition, we here provide a direct demonstration that enhancing motivation, in a variety of ways, can be an effective strategy for enhancing temporal cognition. Understanding the interaction of motivation and cognition is of clinical significance since many psychiatric disorders are characterized by deficits in both domains.",

        "Abstract": "Reports an error in \"The impact of motivation on cognitive performance in an animal model of the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia\" by Ryan D. Ward, Vanessa Winiger, Kerin K. Higa, Julia B. Kahn, Eric R. Kandel, Peter D. Balsam and Eleanor H. Simpson (Behavioral Neuroscience, 2015[Jun], Vol 129[3], 292-299). There is a text error in the 4th paragraph of the Discussion section. The explanation for the abbreviation OFC was incorrectly listed as occipitofrontal circumference. It should have been orbitofrontal cortex. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-18639-001.) Interactions between motivation and cognition are implicated in producing functional impairments and poor quality of life in psychiatric patients. This interaction, however, is not well understood at either the behavioral or neural level. We developed a procedure for mice in which a cognitive measure, sustained attention, is modulated by a motivationally relevant signal that predicts reward probability on a trial-by-trial basis. Using this paradigm, we tested the interaction between motivation and cognition in mice that model the increased striatal D2 receptor activity observed in schizophrenia patients (D2R-OE mice). In control mice, attention was modulated by signaled-reward probability. In D2R-OE mice, however, attention was not modulated by reward-related cues. This impairment was not due to any global deficits in attention or maintenance of the trial-specific information in working memory. Turning off the transgene in D2R-OE mice rescued the motivational modulation of attention. These results indicate that deficits in motivation impair the ability to use reward-related cues to recruit attention and that improving motivation improves functional cognitive performance. These results further suggest that addressing motivational impairments in patients is critical to achieving substantive cognitive and functional gains.",

While some of the roles the OFC plays in value computations and behavior have been identified, the role of the OFC in modulating cognitive resources based on reward expectancy has not been explored. Here we assessed the involvement of OFC in the interaction between motivation and attention. We tested mice in a sustained-attention task in which explicitly signaling the probability of reward differentially modulates discrimination accuracy. Using pharmacogenetic methods, we generated mice in which neuronal activity in the OFC could be transiently and reversibly inhibited during performance of our signaled-probability task. We found that inhibiting OFC neuronal activity abolished the ability of reward-associated cues to differentially impact accuracy of sustained-attention performance. This failure to modulate attention occurred despite evidence that mice still processed the differential value of the reward-associated cues. These data indicate that OFC function is critical for the ability of a reward-related signal to impact other cognitive and decision-making processes and begin to delineate the neural circuitry involved in the interaction between motivation and attention.",

        "Abstract": "Consolidation of implicit memory in the invertebrate Aplysia and explicit memory in the mammalian hippocampus are associated with remodeling and growth of preexisting synapses and the formation of new synapses. Here, we compare and contrast structural components of the synaptic plasticity that underlies these two distinct forms of memory. In both cases, the structural changes involve time-dependent processes. Thus, some modifications are transient and may contribute to early formative stages of long-term memory, whereas others are more stable, longer lasting, and likely to confer persistence to memory storage. In addition, we explore the possibility that trans-synaptic signaling mechanisms governing de novo synapse formation during development can be reused in the adult for the purposes of structural synaptic plasticity and memory storage. Finally, we discuss how these mechanisms set in motion structural rearrangements that prepare a synapse to strengthen the same memory and, perhaps, to allow it to take part in other memories as a basis for understanding how their anatomical representation results in the enhanced expression and storage of memories in the brain.",

        "Abstract": "The maintenance phase of memory-related long-term facilitation (LTF) of synapses between sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia depends on a serotonin (5-HT)-triggered presynaptic upregulation of CPEB, a functional prion that regulates local protein synthesis at the synapse. The mechanisms whereby serotonin regulates CPEB levels in presynaptic sensory neurons are not known. Here, we describe a sensory neuron-specific microRNA 22 (miR-22) that has multiple binding sites on the mRNA of CPEB and inhibits it in the basal state. Serotonin triggers MAPK/Erk-dependent downregulation of miR-22, thereby upregulating the expression of CPEB, which in turn regulates, through functional CPE elements, the presynaptic expression of atypical PKC (aPKC), another candidate regulator of memory maintenance. Our findings support a model in which the neurotransmitter-triggered downregulation of miR-22 coordinates the regulation of genes contributing synergistically to the long-term maintenance of memory-related synaptic plasticity.",

        "Abstract": "The mouse cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3) is a translational regulator implicated in long-term memory maintenance. Invertebrate orthologs of CPEB3 in Aplysia and Drosophila are functional prions that are physiologically active in the aggregated state. To determine if this principle applies to the mammalian CPEB3, we expressed it in yeast and found that it forms heritable aggregates that are the hallmark of known prions. In addition, we confirm in the mouse the importance of CPEB3's prion formation for CPEB3 function. Interestingly, deletion analysis of the CPEB3 prion domain uncovered a tripartite organization: two aggregation-promoting domains surround a regulatory module that affects interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. In all, our data provide direct evidence that CPEB3 is a functional prion in the mammalian brain and underline the potential importance of an actin/CPEB3 feedback loop for the synaptic plasticity underlying the persistence of long-term memory.",

        "Abstract": "Protein synthesis is crucial for the maintenance of long-term-memory-related synaptic plasticity. The prion-like cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3) regulates the translation of several mRNAs important for long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Here, we provide evidence that the prion-like aggregation and activity of CPEB3 is controlled by SUMOylation. In the basal state, CPEB3 is a repressor and is soluble. Under these circumstances, CPEB3 is SUMOylated in hippocampal neurons both in vitro and in vivo. Following neuronal stimulation, CPEB3 is converted into an active form that promotes the translation of target mRNAs, and this is associated with a decrease of SUMOylation and an increase of aggregation. A chimeric CPEB3 protein fused to SUMO cannot form aggregates and cannot activate the translation of target mRNAs. These findings suggest a model whereby SUMO regulates translation of mRNAs and structural synaptic plasticity by modulating the aggregation of the prion-like protein CPEB3.",

        "Abstract": "Consolidation of long-term memories depends on de novo protein synthesis. Several translational regulators have been identified, and their contribution to the formation of memory has been assessed in the mouse hippocampus. None of them, however, has been implicated in the persistence of memory. Although persistence is a key feature of long-term memory, how this occurs, despite the rapid turnover of its molecular substrates, is poorly understood. Here we find that both memory storage and its underlying synaptic plasticity are mediated by the increase in level and in the aggregation of the prion-like translational regulator CPEB3 (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein). Genetic ablation of CPEB3 impairs the maintenance of both hippocampal long-term potentiation and hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. We propose a model whereby persistence of long-term memory results from the assembly of CPEB3 into aggregates. These aggregates serve as functional prions and regulate local protein synthesis necessary for the maintenance of long-term memory.",

        "Abstract": "Interactions between motivation and cognition are implicated in producing functional impairments and poor quality of life in psychiatric patients. This interaction, however, is not well understood at either the behavioral or neural level. We developed a procedure for mice in which a cognitive measure, sustained attention, is modulated by a motivationally relevant signal that predicts reward probability on a trial-by-trial basis. Using this paradigm, we tested the interaction between motivation and cognition in mice that model the increased striatal D2 receptor activity observed in schizophrenia patients (D2R-OE mice). In control mice, attention was modulated by signaled-reward probability. In D2R-OE mice, however, attention was not modulated by reward-related cues. This impairment was not due to any global deficits in attention or maintenance of the trial-specific information in working memory. Turning off the transgene in D2R-OE mice rescued the motivational modulation of attention. These results indicate that deficits in motivation impair the ability to use reward-related cues to recruit attention and that improving motivation improves functional cognitive performance. These results further suggest that addressing motivational impairments in patients is critical to achieving substantive cognitive and functional gains.",

        "Title": "Increased dopamine D2 receptor activity in the striatum alters the firing pattern of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area.",
        "Abstract": "There is strong evidence that the core deficits of schizophrenia result from dysfunction of the dopamine (DA) system, but details of this dysfunction remain unclear. We previously reported a model of transgenic mice that selectively and reversibly overexpress DA D2 receptors (D2Rs) in the striatum (D2R-OE mice). D2R-OE mice display deficits in cognition and motivation that are strikingly similar to the deficits in cognition and motivation observed in patients with schizophrenia. Here, we show that in vivo, both the firing rate (tonic activity) and burst firing (phasic activity) of identified midbrain DA neurons are impaired in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but not in the substantia nigra (SN), of D2R-OE mice. Normalizing striatal D2R activity by switching off the transgene in adulthood recovered the reduction in tonic activity of VTA DA neurons, which is concordant with the rescue in motivation that we previously reported in our model. On the other hand, the reduction in burst activity was not rescued, which may be reflected in the observed persistence of cognitive deficits in D2R-OE mice. We have identified a potential molecular mechanism for the altered activity of DA VTA neurons in D2R-OE mice: a reduction in the expression of distinct NMDA receptor subunits selectively in identified mesolimbic DA VTA, but not nigrostriatal DA SN, neurons. These results suggest that functional deficits relevant for schizophrenia symptoms may involve differential regulation of selective DA pathways.",

        "Abstract": "Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) proteins are translational regulators that are involved in the control of cellular senescence, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. We have previously found all four known CPEB family members to be transcribed in the mouse hippocampus. Aside from a brief description of CPEB2 in mouse brain, not much is known about its biological role. Hence, this study aims to investigate CPEB2 expression in mouse brain. With reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of total mouse brain cDNA, we identified four distinct CPEB2 splice variants. Single-cell RT-PCR showed that CPEB2 is predominantly expressed in neurons of the juvenile and adult brain and that individual cells express different sets of splice variants. Staining of brain slices with a custom-made CPEB2 antibody revealed ubiquitous expression of the protein in many brain regions, including hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, cortex, and cerebellum. We also found differential expression of CPEB2 protein in excitatory, inhibitory, and dopaminergic neurons. In primary hippocampal cultures, the subcellular localization of CPEB2 in neurons and astrocytes resembled that of CPEB1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and RNA coimmunoprecipitation revealed CPEB2 interaction with \u03b2-catenin and Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (both established CPEB1 targets), indicating an overlap in RNA binding specificity between CPEB1 and CPEB2. Furthermore, we identified ephrin receptor A4 as a putative novel target of CPEB2. In conclusion, our study identifies CPEB2 splice variants to be differentially expressed among individual cells and across cell types of the mouse hippocampus, and reveals overlapping binding specificity between CPEB2 and CPEB1.",

        "Abstract": "De novo transcription of DNA is a fundamental requirement for the formation of long-term memory. It is required during both consolidation and reconsolidation, the posttraining and postreactivation phases that change the state of the memory from a fragile into a stable and long-lasting form. Transcription generates both mRNAs that are translated into proteins, which are necessary for the growth of new synaptic connections, as well as noncoding RNA transcripts that have regulatory or effector roles in gene expression. The result is a cascade of events that ultimately leads to structural changes in the neurons that mediate long-term memory storage. The de novo transcription, critical for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, is orchestrated by chromatin and epigenetic modifications. The complexity of transcription regulation, its temporal progression, and the effectors produced all contribute to the flexibility and persistence of long-term memory formation. In this article, we provide an overview of the mechanisms contributing to this transcriptional regulation underlying long-term memory formation.",

        "Abstract": "In certain neurons from different brain regions, a brief burst of action potentials can activate a slow afterdepolarization (sADP) in the presence of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonists. The sADP, if suprathreshold, can contribute to persistent non-accommodating firing in some of these neurons. Previous studies have characterized a Ca(2+)-activated non-selective cation (CAN) current (ICAN ) that is thought to underlie the sADP. ICAN depends on muscarinic receptor stimulation and exhibits a dependence on neuronal activity, membrane depolarization and Ca(2+)-influx similar to that observed for the sADP. Despite the widespread occurrence of sADPs in neurons throughout the brain, the molecular identity of the ion channels underlying these events, as well as ICAN , remains uncertain. Here we used a combination of genetic, pharmacological and electrophysiological approaches to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the muscarinic receptor-dependent sADP in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of mouse prefrontal cortex. First, we confirmed that in the presence of the cholinergic agonist carbachol a brief burst of action potentials triggers a prominent sADP in these neurons. Second, we confirmed that this sADP requires activation of a PLC signaling cascade and intracellular calcium signaling. Third, we obtained direct evidence that the transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin 5 channel (TRPM5), which is thought to function as a CAN channel in non-neural cells, contributes importantly to the sADP in the layer 5 neurons. In contrast, the closely related TRPM4 channel may play only a minor role in the sADP.",

        "Title": "Huntingtin is critical both pre- and postsynaptically for long-term learning-related synaptic plasticity in Aplysia.",
        "Abstract": "Patients with Huntington's disease exhibit memory and cognitive deficits many years before manifesting motor disturbances. Similarly, several studies have shown that deficits in long-term synaptic plasticity, a cellular basis of memory formation and storage, occur well before motor disturbances in the hippocampus of the transgenic mouse models of Huntington's disease. The autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of Huntington's disease suggests the importance of the mutant protein, huntingtin, in pathogenesis of Huntington's disease, but wild type huntingtin also has been shown to be important for neuronal functions such as axonal transport. Yet, the role of wild type huntingtin in long-term synaptic plasticity has not been investigated in detail. We identified a huntingtin homolog in the marine snail Aplysia, and find that similar to the expression pattern in mammalian brain, huntingtin is widely expressed in neurons and glial cells. Importantly the expression of mRNAs of huntingtin is upregulated by repeated applications of serotonin, a modulatory transmitter released during learning in Aplysia. Furthermore, we find that huntingtin expression levels are critical, not only in presynaptic sensory neurons, but also in the postsynaptic motor neurons for serotonin-induced long-term facilitation at the sensory-to-motor neuron synapse of the Aplysia gill-withdrawal reflex. These results suggest a key role for huntingtin in long-term memory storage.",

        "Title": "Learning-induced and stathmin-dependent changes in microtubule stability are critical for memory and disrupted in ageing.",
        "Abstract": "Changes in the stability of microtubules regulate many biological processes, but their role in memory remains unclear. Here we show that learning causes biphasic changes in the microtubule-associated network in the hippocampus. In the early phase, stathmin is dephosphorylated, enhancing its microtubule-destabilizing activity by promoting stathmin-tubulin binding, whereas in the late phase these processes are reversed leading to an increase in microtubule/KIF5-mediated localization of the GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors at synaptic sites. A microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel decreases or increases memory when applied at the early or late phases, respectively. Stathmin mutations disrupt changes in microtubule stability, GluA2 localization, synaptic plasticity and memory. Aged wild-type mice show impairments in stathmin levels, changes in microtubule stability and GluA2 localization. Blocking GluA2 endocytosis rescues memory deficits in stathmin mutant and aged wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate a role for microtubules in memory in young adult and aged individuals.",

        "Abstract": "Tia1/Pub1 is a stress granule component carrying a Q/N-rich prion domain. We provide direct evidence that Tia1 forms a prion in yeast. Moreover, Tia1/Pub1 acts cooperatively with release factor Sup35/eRF3 to establish a two-protein self-propagating state. This two-protein prion driven by the Q/N-rich prion domains of Sup35 and Tia1/Pub1 can be visualized as distinctive line structures along tubulin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, we find that tubulin-associated complex containing Pub1 and Sup35 oligomers normally exists in yeast, and its assembly depends on prion domains of Pub1 and Sup35. This Sup35/Pub1 complex, which also contains TUB1 mRNA and components of translation machinery, is important for the integrity of the tubulin cytoskeleton: PUB1 disruption and Sup35 depletion from the complex lead to cytoskeletal defects. We propose that the complex is implicated in protein synthesis at the site of microtubule assembly. Thus our study identifies the role for prion domains in the assembly of multiprotein complexes.",

        "Title": "Genetic variation in COMT activity impacts learning and dopamine release capacity in the striatum.",
        "Abstract": "A common genetic polymorphism that results in increased activity of the dopamine regulating enzyme COMT (the COMT Val(158) allele) has been found to associate with poorer cognitive performance and increased susceptibility to develop psychiatric disorders. It is generally assumed that this increase in COMT activity influences cognitive function and psychiatric disease risk by increasing dopamine turnover in cortical synapses, though this cannot be directly measured in humans. Here we explore a novel transgenic mouse model of increased COMT activity, equivalent to the relative increase in activity observed with the human COMT Val(158) allele. By performing an extensive battery of behavioral tests, we found that COMT overexpressing mice (COMT-OE mice) exhibit cognitive deficits selectively in the domains that are affected by the COMT Val(158) allele, stimulus-response learning and working memory, functionally validating our model of increased COMT activity. Although we detected no changes in the level of markers for dopamine synthesis and dopamine transport, we found that COMT-OE mice display an increase in dopamine release capacity in the striatum. This result suggests that increased COMT activity may not only affect dopamine signaling by enhancing synaptic clearance in the cortex, but may also cause changes in presynaptic dopamine function in the striatum. These changes may underlie the behavioral deficits observed in the mice and might also play a role in the cognitive deficits and increased psychiatric disease risk associated with genetic variation in COMT activity in humans.",

        "Abstract": "The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is critical for spatial memory and is also thought to be involved in the formation of drug-related associative memory. Here, we attempt to test an aspect of the Gateway Hypothesis, by studying the effect of consecutive exposure to nicotine and cocaine on long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the DG. We find that a single injection of cocaine does not alter LTP. However, pretreatment with nicotine followed by a single injection of cocaine causes a substantial enhancement of LTP. This priming effect of nicotine is unidirectional: There is no enhancement of LTP if cocaine is administrated prior to nicotine. The facilitation induced by nicotine and cocaine can be blocked by oral administration of the dopamine D1/D5 receptor antagonist (SKF 83566) and enhanced by the D1/D5 agonist (SKF 38393). Application of the histone deacetylation inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) simulates the priming effect of nicotine on cocaine. By contrast, the priming effect of nicotine on cocaine is blocked in genetically modified mice that are haploinsufficient for the CREB-binding protein (CBP) and possess only one functional CBP allele and therefore exhibit a reduction in histone acetylation. These results demonstrate that the DG of the hippocampus is an important brain region contributing to the priming effect of nicotine on cocaine. Moreover, both activation of dopamine-D1 receptor/PKA signaling pathway and histone deacetylation/CBP mediated transcription are required for the nicotine priming effect in the DG.",

        "Title": "Molecular mechanism for age-related memory loss: the histone-binding protein RbAp48.",
        "Abstract": "To distinguish age-related memory loss more explicitly from Alzheimer's disease (AD), we have explored its molecular underpinning in the dentate gyrus (DG), a subregion of the hippocampal formation thought to be targeted by aging. We carried out a gene expression study in human postmortem tissue harvested from both DG and entorhinal cortex (EC), a neighboring subregion unaffected by aging and known to be the site of onset of AD. Using expression in the EC for normalization, we identified 17 genes that manifested reliable age-related changes in the DG. The most significant change was an age-related decline in RbAp48, a histone-binding protein that modifies histone acetylation. To test whether the RbAp48 decline could be responsible for age-related memory loss, we turned to mice and found that, consistent with humans, RbAp48 was less abundant in the DG of old than in young mice. We next generated a transgenic mouse that expressed a dominant-negative inhibitor of RbAp48 in the adult forebrain. Inhibition of RbAp48 in young mice caused hippocampus-dependent memory deficits similar to those associated with aging, as measured by novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies showed that within the hippocampal formation, dysfunction was selectively observed in the DG, and this corresponded to a regionally selective decrease in histone acetylation. Up-regulation of RbAp48 in the DG of aged wild-type mice ameliorated age-related hippocampus-based memory loss and age-related abnormalities in histone acetylation. Together, these findings show that the DG is a hippocampal subregion targeted by aging, and identify molecular mechanisms of cognitive aging that could serve as valid targets for therapeutic intervention.",

        "Abstract": "In many cortical neurons, HCN1 channels are the major contributors to Ih, the hyperpolarization-activated current, which regulates the intrinsic properties of neurons and shapes their integration of synaptic inputs, paces rhythmic activity, and regulates synaptic plasticity. Here, we examine the physiological role of Ih in deep layer pyramidal neurons in mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), focusing on persistent activity, a form of sustained firing thought to be important for the behavioral function of the PFC during working memory tasks. We find that HCN1 contributes to the intrinsic persistent firing that is induced by a brief depolarizing current stimulus in the presence of muscarinic agonists. Deletion of HCN1 or acute pharmacological blockade of Ih decreases the fraction of neurons capable of generating persistent firing. The reduction in persistent firing is caused by the membrane hyperpolarization that results from the deletion of HCN1 or Ih blockade, rather than a specific role of the hyperpolarization-activated current in generating persistent activity. In vivo recordings show that deletion of HCN1 has no effect on up states, periods of enhanced synaptic network activity. Parallel behavioral studies demonstrate that HCN1 contributes to the PFC-dependent resolution of proactive interference during working memory. These results thus provide genetic evidence demonstrating the importance of HCN1 to intrinsic persistent firing and the behavioral output of the PFC. The causal role of intrinsic persistent firing in PFC-mediated behavior remains an open question.",

        "Abstract": "Despite cash-strapped times for research, several ambitious collaborative neuroscience projects have attracted large amounts of funding and media attention. In Europe, the Human Brain Project aims to develop a large-scale computer simulation of the brain, whereas in the United States, the Brain Activity Map is working towards establishing a functional connectome of the entire brain, and the Allen Institute for Brain Science has embarked upon a 10-year project to understand the mouse visual cortex (the MindScope project). US President Barack Obama's announcement of the BRAIN Initiative (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative) in April 2013 highlights the political commitment to neuroscience and is expected to further foster interdisciplinary collaborations, accelerate the development of new technologies and thus fuel much needed medical advances. In this Viewpoint article, five prominent neuroscientists explain the aims of the projects and how they are addressing some of the questions (and criticisms) that have arisen.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, a greater understanding has emerged of the role epigenetic mechanisms play in the brain, not only during development, but also in mature neurons involved in long-term memory. The identification of spatially and temporally tuned epigenetic modification of genetic loci during memory storage has revealed the remarkably input-responsive, target-specific, and long-term nature of epigenetic regulation, but the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. New insight into these mechanisms has come from the study of small RNAs, which have emerged as regulators that can confer sequence specificity to DNA- and chromatin-modifying processes. We discuss advances in the elucidation of the epigenetic mechanisms involved in long-term memory, focusing on the role of small RNAs, and in particular piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), in the epigenetic regulation underlying memory storage.",

        "Abstract": "A key to understanding the evolution of the nervous system on a large phylogenetic scale is the identification of homologous neuronal types. Here, we focus this search on the sensory and motor neurons of bilaterians, exploiting their well-defined molecular signatures in vertebrates. Sensorimotor circuits in vertebrates are of two types: somatic (that sense the environment and respond by shaping bodily motions) and visceral (that sense the interior milieu and respond by regulating vital functions). These circuits differ by a small set of largely dedicated transcriptional determinants: Brn3 is expressed in many somatic sensory neurons, first and second order (among which mechanoreceptors are uniquely marked by the Brn3+/Islet1+/Drgx+ signature), somatic motoneurons uniquely co-express Lhx3/4 and Mnx1, while the vast majority of neurons, sensory and motor, involved in respiration, blood circulation or digestion are molecularly defined by their expression and dependence on the pan-visceral determinant Phox2b.",

        "Title": "Nicotine primes the effect of cocaine on the induction of LTP in the amygdala.",
        "Abstract": "In human populations, there is a well-defined sequence of involvement in drugs of abuse, in which the use of nicotine or alcohol precedes the use of marijuana, which in turn, precedes the use of cocaine. The term \"Gateway Hypothesis\" describes this developmental sequence of drug involvement. In prior work, we have developed a mouse model to study the underlying metaplastic behavioral, cellular and molecular mechanisms by which exposure to one drug, namely nicotine, affects the response to another drug, namely cocaine. We found that nicotine enhances significantly the changes in synaptic plasticity in the striatum induced by cocaine (Levine et\u00a0al., 2011). Here we ask: does the metaplastic effect of nicotine on cocaine also apply in the amygdala, a brain region that is involved in the orchestration of emotions and in drug addiction? We find that pretreatment with nicotine enhances long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) in response to cocaine in the amygdala. Both short-term (1 day) and long-term (7 days) pre-exposure to nicotine facilitate the induction of LTP by cocaine. The effect of nicotine on LTP is unidirectional; exposure to nicotine following treatment with cocaine is ineffective. This metaplastic effect of nicotine on cocaine is long lasting but reversible. The facilitation of LTP can be obtained for 24 but not 40 days after cessation of nicotine. As is the case in the striatum, pretreatment with Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, simulates the priming effect of nicotine. These results provide further evidence that the priming effect of nicotine may be achieved, at least partially, by the inhibition of histone acetylation and indicate that the amygdala appears to be an important brain structure for the processing of the metaplastic effect of nicotine on cocaine. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Glutamate Receptor-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity'.",

Several of these RNAs have key roles in the maintenance of synaptic function and growth.

        "Abstract": "Neurotrophins control the development and adult plasticity of the vertebrate nervous system. Failure to identify invertebrate neurotrophin orthologs, however, has precluded studies in invertebrate models, limiting our understanding of fundamental aspects of neurotrophin biology and function. We identified a neurotrophin (ApNT) and Trk receptor (ApTrk) in the mollusk Aplysia and found that they play a central role in learning-related synaptic plasticity. Blocking ApTrk signaling impairs long-term facilitation, whereas augmenting ApNT expression enhances it and induces the growth of new synaptic varicosities at the monosynaptic connection between sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex. Unlike vertebrate neurotrophins, ApNT has multiple coding exons and exerts distinct synaptic effects through differentially processed and secreted splice isoforms. Our findings demonstrate the existence of bona fide neurotrophin signaling in invertebrates and reveal a posttranscriptional mechanism that regulates neurotrophin processing and the release of proneurotrophins and mature neurotrophins that differentially modulate synaptic plasticity.",

        "Abstract": "The neuronal isoform of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB) is a regulator of local protein synthesis at synapses and is critical in maintaining learning-related synaptic plasticity in Aplysia. Previous studies indicate that the function of Aplysia CPEB can be modulated by conversion to a stable prion-like state, thus contributing to the stabilization of long-term memory on a molecular level. Here, we used biophysical methods to demonstrate that Aplysia CPEB, like other prions, undergoes a conformational switch from soluble \u03b1-helix-rich oligomer to \u03b2-sheet-rich fiber in vitro. Solid-state NMR analyses of the fibers indicated a relatively rigid N-terminal prion domain. The fiber form of Aplysia CPEB showed enhanced binding to target mRNAs as compared to the soluble form. Consequently, we propose a model for the Aplysia CPEB fibers that may have relevance for functional prions in general.",

        "Title": "Learning-related synaptic growth mediated by internalization of Aplysia cell adhesion molecule is controlled by membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate synthetic pathway.",
        "Abstract": "Long-term facilitation in Aplysia is accompanied by the growth of new synaptic connections between the sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex. One of the initial steps leading to the growth of these synapses is the internalization, induced by 5-HT, of the transmembrane isoform of Aplysia cell-adhesion molecule (TM-apCAM) from the plasma membrane of sensory neurons (Bailey et al., 1992). However, the mechanisms that govern the internalization of TM-apCAM and how this internalization is coupled to the molecular events that initiate the structural changes are not fully understood. Here, we report that the synthesis of membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P(2)], which is known to be mediated by a signaling cascade through Aplysia Sec7 protein (ApSec7) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type I \u03b1 (PIP5KI\u03b1) is required for both the internalization of TM-apCAM and the initiation of synaptic growth during 5-HT-induced long-term facilitation. Pharmacological blockade of PI(4,5)P(2) synthesis by the application of the inhibitor phenylarsine oxide blocked the internalization of apCAM. Furthermore, perturbation of the endogenous activation of ApSec7 and its downstream target PIP5KI\u03b1 also blocked 5-HT-mediated internalization of TM-apCAM and synaptic growth. Finally, long-term facilitation was specifically impaired by blocking the ApSec7 signaling pathway at sensory-to-motor neuron synapses. These data indicate that the ApSec7/PIP5KI\u03b1 signaling pathway is actively recruited during learning-related 5-HT signaling and acts as a key regulator of apCAM internalization associated with the formation of new synaptic connections during long-term facilitation.",

Mouse models of such human diseases are commonly subjected to maze-based tests that can neither distinguish between these cognitive functions nor isolate specific aspects of either function. Here, we have adapted a simple visual discrimination task, and by varying only the timing of events within the same task construct, we are able to measure independently the behavioral response to increasing attentional demand and increasing length of time that information must be maintained in working memory. We determined that mPFC lesions in mice impair attention but not working memory maintenance.",

        "Abstract": "The memory reconsolidation hypothesis suggests that a memory trace becomes labile after retrieval and needs to be reconsolidated before it can be stabilized. However, it is unclear from earlier studies whether the same synapses involved in encoding the memory trace are those that are destabilized and restabilized after the synaptic reactivation that accompanies memory retrieval, or whether new and different synapses are recruited. To address this issue, we studied a simple nonassociative form of memory, long-term sensitization of the gill- and siphon-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia, and its cellular analog, long-term facilitation at the sensory-to-motor neuron synapse. We found that after memory retrieval, behavioral long-term sensitization in Aplysia becomes labile via ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent protein degradation and is reconsolidated by means of de novo protein synthesis. In parallel, we found that on the cellular level, long-term facilitation at the sensory-to-motor neuron synapse that mediates long-term sensitization is also destabilized by protein degradation and is restabilized by protein synthesis after synaptic reactivation, a procedure that parallels memory retrieval or retraining evident on the behavioral level. These results provide direct evidence that the same synapses that store the long-term memory trace encoded by changes in the strength of synaptic connections critical for sensitization are disrupted and reconstructed after signal retrieval.",

        "Abstract": "Whereas short-term (minutes) facilitation at Aplysia sensory-motor neuron synapses is presynaptic, long-term (days) facilitation involves synaptic growth, which requires both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. How are the postsynaptic mechanisms recruited, and when does that process begin? We have been investigating the possible role of spontaneous transmitter release from the presynaptic neuron. In the previous paper, we found that spontaneous release is critical for the induction of long-term facilitation, and this process begins during an intermediate-term stage of facilitation that is the first stage to involve postsynaptic as well as presynaptic mechanisms. We now report that increased spontaneous release during the short-term stage acts as an orthograde signal to recruit postsynaptic mechanisms of intermediate-term facilitation including increased IP3, Ca(2+), and membrane insertion and recruitment of clusters of AMPA-like receptors, which may be first steps in synaptic growth during long-term facilitation. These results suggest that the different stages of facilitation involve a cascade of pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms, which is initiated by spontaneous release and may culminate in synaptic growth.",

        "Abstract": "Long-term plasticity can differ from short-term in recruiting the growth of new synaptic connections, a process that requires the participation of both the presynaptic and postsynaptic components of the synapse. How does information about synaptic plasticity spread from its site of origin to recruit the other component? The answer to this question is not known in most systems. We have investigated the possible role of spontaneous transmitter release as such a transsynaptic signal. Until recently, relatively little has been known about the functions of spontaneous release. In this paper, we report that spontaneous release is critical for the induction of a learning-related form of synaptic plasticity, long-term facilitation in Aplysia. In addition, we have found that this signaling is engaged quite early, during an intermediate-term stage that is the first stage to involve postsynaptic as well as presynaptic molecular mechanisms. In a companion paper, we show that spontaneous release from the presynaptic neuron acts as an orthograde signal to recruit the postsynaptic mechanisms of intermediate-term facilitation and initiates a cascade that can culminate in synaptic growth with additional stimulation during long-term facilitation. Spontaneous release could make a similar contribution to learning-related synaptic plasticity in mammals.",

        "Abstract": "Small RNA-mediated gene regulation during development causes long-lasting changes in cellular phenotypes. To determine whether small RNAs of the adult brain can regulate memory storage, a process that requires stable and long-lasting changes in the functional state of neurons, we generated small RNA libraries from the Aplysia CNS. In these libraries, we discovered an unexpectedly abundant expression of a 28 nucleotide sized class of piRNAs in brain, which had been thought to be germline specific. These piRNAs have unique biogenesis patterns, predominant nuclear localization, and robust sensitivity to serotonin, a modulatory transmitter that is important for memory. We find that the Piwi/piRNA complex facilitates serotonin-dependent methylation of a conserved CpG island in the promoter of CREB2, the major inhibitory constraint of memory in Aplysia, leading to enhanced long-term synaptic facilitation. These findings provide a small RNA-mediated gene regulatory mechanism for establishing stable long-term changes in neurons for the persistence of memory.",

        "Abstract": "The synapse is the functional unit of the brain. During the last several decades we have acquired a great deal of information on its structure, molecular components, and physiological function. It is clear that synapses are morphologically and molecularly diverse and that this diversity is recruited to different functions. One of the most intriguing findings is that the size of the synaptic response in not invariant, but can be altered by a variety of homo- and heterosynaptic factors such as past patterns of use or modulatory neurotransmitters. Perhaps the most difficult challenge in neuroscience is to design experiments that reveal how these basic building blocks of the brain are put together and how they are regulated to mediate the information flow through neural circuits that is necessary to produce complex behaviors and store memories. In this review we will focus on studies that attempt to uncover the role of synaptic plasticity in the regulation of whole-animal behavior by learning and memory.",

        "Title": "Dissociation of hedonic reaction to reward and incentive motivation in an animal model of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.",
        "Abstract": "We previously showed that mice that selectively and reversibly overexpress striatal D2 receptors (D2R-OE) model the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Specifically, D2R-OE mice display a deficit in incentive motivation. The present studies investigated the basis for this deficit. First, we assessed whether hedonic reaction to reward is intact in D2R-OE mice. We assessed licking behavior and video-scored positive hedonic facial reactions to increasing concentrations of sucrose in control and D2R-OE mice. We found no difference between D2R-OE mice and controls in hedonic reactions. To further understand the basis of the motivational deficit, mice were given a choice between pressing a lever for access to a preferred reward (evaporated milk) or consuming a freely available less preferred reward (home-cage chow). D2R-OE mice pressed less for the preferred milk and consumed more of the freely available less preferred chow, indicating that striatal overexpression of postsynaptic D2Rs can alter cost/benefit computations, leading to a motivational deficit. This motivational impairment was ameliorated when the transgene was turned off and D2R levels were normalized. Such a deficit may arise from impaired ability to represent the value of future rewards. To test this, we used operant concurrent schedules and found reduced sensitivity to the value of future outcomes in D2R-OE mice. These results demonstrate for the first time in a transgenic animal model of schizophrenia a dissociation between hedonic reaction to reward and incentive motivation, and show a striking parallel to the proposed neurobiological and psychological mechanisms of impaired incentive motivation in schizophrenia.",

The incorporation of expressed actin-GFP monomers into endogenous actin polymers enables energy migration FRET (emFRET, or homoFRET) between neighboring actin-GFPs. This energy migration reduces the normally high polarization of the GFP fluorescence. We derive a simple relationship between the actin-GFP fluorescence polarization anisotropy and the actin polymer fraction, thereby enabling a robust means of imaging the actin polymerization state with high spatiotemporal resolution and providing what to the best of our knowledge are the first direct images of the actin polymerization state in live, adult brain tissue and live, intact Drosophila larvae.",

        "Abstract": "The cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3), a regulator of local protein synthesis, is the mouse homolog of ApCPEB, a functional prion protein in Aplysia. Here, we provide evidence that CPEB3 is activated by Neuralized1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. In hippocampal cultures, CPEB3 activated by Neuralized1-mediated ubiquitination leads both to the growth of new dendritic spines and to an increase of the GluA1 and GluA2 subunits of AMPA receptors, two CPEB3 targets essential for synaptic plasticity. Conditional overexpression of Neuralized1 similarly increases GluA1 and GluA2 and the number of spines and functional synapses in the hippocampus and is reflected in enhanced hippocampal-dependent memory and synaptic plasticity. By contrast, inhibition of Neuralized1 reduces GluA1 and GluA2 levels and impairs hippocampal-dependent memory and synaptic plasticity. These results suggest a model whereby Neuralized1-dependent ubiquitination facilitates hippocampal plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memory storage by modulating the activity of CPEB3 and CPEB3-dependent protein synthesis and synapse formation.",

        "Abstract": "Entorhinal grid cells have periodic, hexagonally patterned firing locations that scale up progressively along the dorsal-ventral axis of medial entorhinal cortex. This topographic expansion corresponds with parallel changes in cellular properties dependent on the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih), which is conducted by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. To test the hypothesis that grid scale is determined by Ih, we recorded grid cells in mice with forebrain-specific knockout of HCN1. We find that, although the dorsal-ventral gradient of the grid pattern was preserved in HCN1 knockout mice, the size and spacing of the grid fields, as well as the period of the accompanying theta modulation, was expanded at all dorsal-ventral levels. There was no change in theta modulation of simultaneously recorded entorhinal interneurons. These observations raise the possibility that, during self-motion-based navigation, Ih contributes to the gain of the transformation from movement signals to spatial firing fields.",

HCN1 is strongly expressed in CA1 neurons and in entorhinal cortex grid cells, which provide spatial information to the hippocampus. Both CA1 and CA3 place fields were larger but more stable in the knockout mice, with the effect greater in CA1 than CA3. As HCN1 is only weakly expressed in CA3 place cells, their altered activity likely reflects loss of HCN1 in grid cells. The more pronounced changes in CA1 likely reflect the intrinsic contribution of HCN1. The enhanced place field stability may underlie the effect of HCN1 deletion to facilitate spatial learning and memory.",

        "Title": "Molecular mechanism for a gateway drug: epigenetic changes initiated by nicotine prime gene expression by cocaine.",
        "Abstract": "In human populations, cigarettes and alcohol generally serve as gateway drugs, which people use first before progressing to marijuana, cocaine, or other illicit substances. To understand the biological basis of the gateway sequence of drug use, we developed an animal model in mice and used it to study the effects of nicotine on subsequent responses to cocaine. We found that pretreatment of mice with nicotine increased the response to cocaine, as assessed by addiction-related behaviors and synaptic plasticity in the striatum, a brain region critical for addiction-related reward. Locomotor sensitization was increased by 98%, conditioned place preference was increased by 78%, and cocaine-induced reduction in long-term potentiation (LTP) was enhanced by 24%. The responses to cocaine were altered only when nicotine was administered first, and nicotine and cocaine were then administered concurrently. Reversing the order of drug administration was ineffective; cocaine had no effect on nicotine-induced behaviors and synaptic plasticity. Nicotine primed the response to cocaine by enhancing its ability to induce transcriptional activation of the FosB gene through inhibition of histone deacetylase, which caused global histone acetylation in the striatum. We tested this conclusion further and found that a histone deacetylase inhibitor simulated the actions of nicotine by priming the response to cocaine and enhancing FosB gene expression and LTP depression in the nucleus accumbens. Conversely, in a genetic mouse model characterized by reduced histone acetylation, the effects of cocaine on LTP were diminished. We achieved a similar effect by infusing a low dose of theophylline, an activator of histone deacetylase, into the nucleus accumbens. These results from mice prompted an analysis of epidemiological data, which indicated that most cocaine users initiate cocaine use after the onset of smoking and while actively still smoking, and that initiating cocaine use after smoking increases the risk of becoming dependent on cocaine, consistent with our data from mice. If our findings in mice apply to humans, a decrease in smoking rates in young people would be expected to lead to a decrease in cocaine addiction.",

        "Title": "D2 receptor overexpression in the striatum leads to a deficit in inhibitory transmission and dopamine sensitivity in mouse prefrontal cortex.",
        "Abstract": "Two distinct defects are thought to be important for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. One is an increase of D2 receptors (D2Rs) in the striatum and another is a decrease in the GABAergic function in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Whether these two defects are functionally linked is not known. We previously reported that selective overexpression of D2Rs in the striatum of the mouse causes behavioral abnormality associated with PFC functions. Using patch-clamp recording, we find that overexpression of D2Rs in the striatum affects inhibitory transmission in the PFC and dopamine (DA) sensitivity. The overexpression of D2Rs in the striatum caused an increase in frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in layer V pyramidal neurons, whereas their neuronal excitability was unaffected. In contrast, both the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were significantly decreased in these mice, indicating a reduced inhibitory transmission. Furthermore, in D2R transgenic mice the dopaminergic modulation of evoked IPSCs was shifted, with reduced sensitivity. The change in dopamine sensitivity in the PFC of D2R transgenic mice appears specific for D2Rs because in D2R transgenic mice the effects of D2 agonist but not D1 agonist, on both evoked IPSCs and EPSCs, were reduced. Together, these results indicate that overexpression of D2Rs in the striatum leads to a functional deficit in the GABAergic system. These results provide a functional link between D2R overexpression and GABAergic inhibition in the PFC and suggest that the postulated deficit in GABAergic function in schizophrenia could be secondary to alterations in the striatal dopamine system.",

        "Abstract": "Neurexin and neuroligin, which undergo heterophilic interactions with each other at the synapse, are mutated in some patients with autism spectrum disorder, a set of disorders characterized by deficits in social and emotional learning. We have explored the role of neurexin and neuroligin at sensory-to-motor neuron synapses of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia, which undergoes sensitization, a simple form of learned fear. We find that depleting neurexin in the presynaptic sensory neuron or neuroligin in the postsynaptic motor neuron abolishes both long-term facilitation and the associated presynaptic growth induced by repeated pulses of serotonin. Moreover, introduction into the motor neuron of the R451C mutation of neuroligin-3 linked to autism spectrum disorder blocks both intermediate-term and long-term facilitation. Our results suggest that activity-dependent regulation of the neurexin-neuroligin interaction may govern transsynaptic signaling required for the storage of long-term memory, including emotional memory that may be impaired in autism spectrum disorder.",

        "Abstract": "Distorted interval timing is a common feature of the cognitive impairment observed in patients with schizophrenia. The neural circuits which are required for interval timing and those thought to be compromised in schizophrenia overlap and include the cortico-striatal pathways. Here, we suggest that a focus on temporal information processing offers a window into understanding the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia and how deficits might contribute to a variety of symptoms. A disruption in the functioning of the cortico-striatal pathways may lead to cognitive deficits which in turn lead to impaired processing of temporal information. Disrupted temporal processing may also contribute to a variety of other symptoms associated with the disorder. Because interval timing is a cognitive/behavioral phenotype that can easily be assessed in animals it can be used as a sensitive screen for deficits in animal models. Using a recently developed transgenic mouse that models increased D2 receptor upregulation in the striatum similar to that observed in patients with schizophrenia we illustrate the utility of an interval timing approach in assessing cognitive impairment. We further discuss how variants of timing procedures can be used to assess attention and working memory performance as well as other necessary components of adaptive cognitive function.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years it has become possible to develop animal models of psychiatric disease in genetically modified mice. While great strides have been made in the development of genetic and neurobiological tools with which to model psychiatric disease, elucidation of neural and molecular mechanisms thought to underlie behavioral phenotypes has been hindered by an inadequate analysis of behavior. This is unfortunate given the fact that the experimental analysis of behavior has created powerful methods for isolating and describing the functional properties of behavioral mechanisms that are capable of providing deep understanding of behavioral phenotypes. A better understanding of the biological basis of normal behavior and its disturbance in psychiatric disease will require the application of these rigorous behavior analytic tools to animal models. In this review we provide an example of a merging of genetic and behavioral methods and illustrate its utility in the analysis of a mouse model of the motivational deficits in schizophrenia. The synergy between basic behavior analysis, neuroscience, and animal models of psychiatric disease has great potential for achieving a deeper understanding of behavior and its neurobiological mechanisms as well as for leading to improvements in diagnosis and treatment in clinical settings.",

        "Abstract": "Whereas short-term plasticity involves covalent modifications that are generally restricted to either presynaptic or postsynaptic structures, long-term plasticity involves the growth of new synapses, which by its nature involves both pre- and postsynaptic alterations. In addition, an intermediate-term stage of plasticity has been identified that might form a bridge between short- and long-term plasticity. Consistent with that idea, although short-term term behavioral sensitization in Aplysia involves presynaptic mechanisms, intermediate-term sensitization involves both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms. However, it has not been known whether that is also true of facilitation in vitro, where a more detailed analysis of the mechanisms involved in the different stages and their interrelations is feasible. To address those questions, we have examined pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of short- and intermediate-term facilitation at Aplysia sensory-motor neuron synapses in isolated cell culture. Whereas short-term facilitation by 1-min 5-HT involves presynaptic PKA and CamKII, intermediate-term facilitation by 10-min 5-HT involves presynaptic PKC and postsynaptic Ca(2+) and CamKII, as well as both pre- and postsynaptic protein synthesis. These results support the idea that the intermediate-term stage is the first to involve both pre- and postsynaptic molecular mechanisms, which could in turn serve as some of the initial steps in a cascade leading to synaptic growth during long-term plasticity.",

        "Abstract": "The functional switch of glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich prions and the neurotoxicity of polyQ-expanded proteins involve complex aggregation-prone structural transitions, commonly presumed to be forming \u03b2 sheets. By analyzing sequences of interaction partners of these proteins, we discovered a recurrent presence of coiled-coil domains both in the partners and in segments that flank or overlap Q/N-rich and polyQ domains. Since coiled coils can mediate protein interactions and multimerization, we studied their possible involvement in Q/N-rich and polyQ aggregations. Using circular dichroism and chemical crosslinking, we found that Q/N-rich and polyQ peptides form \u03b1-helical coiled coils in\u00a0vitro and assemble into multimers. Using structure-guided mutagenesis, we found that coiled-coil domains modulate in\u00a0vivo properties of two Q/N-rich prions and polyQ-expanded huntingtin. Mutations that disrupt coiled coils impair aggregation and activity, whereas mutations that enhance coiled-coil propensity promote aggregation. These findings support a coiled-coil model for the functional switch of Q/N-rich prions and for the pathogenesis of polyQ-expansion diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Loss of the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is associated with presumed postsynaptic deficits in mouse models of Fragile X syndrome. However, the possible presynaptic roles of FMRP in learning-related plasticity have received little attention. As a result, the mechanisms whereby FMRP influences synaptic function remain poorly understood. To investigate the cellular locus of the effects of FMRP on synaptic plasticity, we cloned the Aplysia homolog of FMRP and find it to be highly expressed in neurons. By selectively down-regulating FMRP in individual Aplysia neurons at the sensory-to-motor neuron synapse reconstituted in co-cultures, we demonstrate that FMRP functions both pre- and postsynaptically to constrain the expression of long-term synaptic depression induced by repeated pulses of FMRF-amide. In contrast, FMRP has little to no effect on long-term synaptic facilitation induced by repeated pulses of serotonin. Since other components of signaling pathways involved in plasticity appear to be conserved between Aplysia and mammalian neurons, our findings suggest that FMRP can participate in both pre- and postsynaptic regulation of enduring synaptic plasticity that underlies the storage of certain types of long-term memory.",

        "Abstract": "The marine mollusk Aplysia is a fascinating model organism for studying molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory. However, evolutionary studies about Aplysia have been limited by the lack of its genomic information. Recently, large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) databases have been acquired by sequencing cDNA libraries from A. californica and A. kurodai. The closeness between the two species allowed us to investigate rapidly evolving genes by comparing their orthologs. Using this method, we found that a subset of signal transduction genes in neurons showed rates of protein evolution higher than those of housekeeping genes. Moreover, we were also able to find several candidate genes that may be involved in learning and memory or synaptic plasticity among genes showing relatively higher K(a)/K(s) ratios. We also investigated the relationship between evolutionary rates and tissue distribution of Aplysia genes. They propose that the estimation of evolutionary rates cannot be a good marker to assess neuronal expression; however, it still can be an efficient way to narrow down the pool of candidate genes involved in neuronal functions for the further studies.",

        "Abstract": "Synaptic plasticity and learning involve different mechanisms depending on the following: (1) the stage of plasticity and (2) the history of plasticity, or metaplasticity. However, little is known about how these two factors are related. We have addressed that question by examining mechanisms of synaptic plasticity during short-term and intermediate-term behavioral sensitization and dishabituation in a semi-intact preparation of the Aplysia siphon-withdrawal reflex. Dishabituation differs from sensitization in that it is preceded by habituation, and is thus a paradigm for metaplasticity. We find that whereas facilitation during short-term sensitization by one tail shock involves presynaptic covalent modifications by protein kinase A (PKA) and CamKII, facilitation during intermediate-term sensitization by four shocks involves both presynaptic (PKA, CaMKII) and postsynaptic (Ca(2+), CaMKII) covalent modifications, as well as both presynaptic and postsynaptic protein synthesis. The facilitation also involves presynaptic spike broadening 2.5 min after either one or four shocks, but not at later times. Dishabituation by four shocks differs from sensitization in several ways. First, it does not involve PKA or CaMKII, but rather involves presynaptic PKC. In addition, unlike sensitization with the same shock, dishabituation by four shocks does not involve protein synthesis or presynaptic spike broadening, and it also does not involve postsynaptic Ca(2+). These results demonstrate that not only the mechanisms but also the site of plasticity depend on both the stage of plasticity and metaplasticity during memory formation.",

        "Abstract": "The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are largely resistant to current treatment and are thus a life-long burden of the illness. Studies of cognitive symptoms have commonly focused on prefrontal cortex because of its demonstrated importance for executive function and working memory--key components of the deficit. The role of striatal-cortical circuitry and therefore the striatum itself has received much less attention. Here we review longstanding evidence that the striatum and its cortical connections are critical for complex cognition and discuss emerging evidence of the striatum's potential involvement in cognitive symptoms. Finally, we suggest how mouse models might test ideas about the contribution of early striatal dysfunction to the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.",

        "Abstract": "Reference memory characterizes the long-term storage of information acquired through numerous trials. In contrast, working memory represents the short-term acquisition of trial-unique information. A number of studies in the rodent hippocampus have focused on the contribution of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) to long-term reference memory. In contrast, little is known about the synaptic plasticity correlates of hippocampal-based components of working memory. Here, we described a mouse with selective expression of a dominant-negative mutant of the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) only in two regions of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus and area CA1. This mouse showed a deficit in several forms of LTP in both hippocampal subregions and a lowered threshold for the consolidation of long-term synaptic depression (LTD). When trained with one trial per day in a water maze task, mutant mice displayed a deficit in consolidation of long-term memory. In contrast, these mice proved to be more flexible after a transfer test and also showed a delay-dependent increased performance in working memory, when repetitive information (proactive interference) was presented. We suggest that through its bidirectional control over synaptic plasticity PKA can regulate opposing forms of memory. The defect in L-LTP disrupts long-term memory consolidation. The persistence of LTD may allow acquisition of new information by restricting the body of previously stored information and suppressing interference.",

        "Abstract": "Despite considerable evidence for a critical role of neuroligin-1 in the specification of excitatory synapses, the cellular mechanisms and physiological roles of neuroligin-1 in mature neural circuits are poorly understood. In mutant mice deficient in neuroligin-1, or adult rats in which neuroligin-1 was depleted, we have found that neuroligin-1 stabilizes the NMDA receptors residing in the postsynaptic membrane of amygdala principal neurons, which allows for a normal range of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. We observed marked decreases in NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents at afferent inputs to the amygdala of neuroligin-1 knockout mice. However, the knockout mice exhibited a significant impairment in spike-timing-dependent long-term potentiation (STD-LTP) at the thalamic but not the cortical inputs to the amygdala. Subsequent electrophysiological analyses indicated that STD-LTP in the cortical pathway is largely independent of activation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors. These findings suggest that neuroligin-1 can modulate, in a pathway-specific manner, synaptic plasticity in the amygdala circuits of adult animals, likely by regulating the abundance of postsynaptic NMDA receptors.",

        "Abstract": "Prions are proteins that can assume at least two distinct conformational states, one of which is dominant and self-perpetuating. Previously we found that a translation regulator CPEB from Aplysia, ApCPEB, that stabilizes activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy can display prion-like properties in yeast. Here we find that, when exogenously expressed in sensory neurons, ApCPEB can form an amyloidogenic self-sustaining multimer, consistent with it being a prion-like protein. In addition, we find that conversion of both the exogenous and the endogenous ApCPEB to the multimeric state is enhanced by the neurotransmitter serotonin and that an antibody that recognizes preferentially the multimeric ApCPEB blocks persistence of synaptic facilitation. These results are consistent with the idea that ApCPEB can act as a self-sustaining prion-like protein in the nervous system and thereby might allow the activity-dependent change in synaptic efficacy to persist for long periods of time.",

        "Abstract": "Memory storage and memory-related synaptic plasticity rely on precise spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. To explore the role of small regulatory RNAs in learning-related synaptic plasticity, we carried out massive parallel sequencing to profile the small RNAs of Aplysia californica. We identified 170 distinct miRNAs, 13 of which were novel and specific to Aplysia. Nine miRNAs were brain enriched, and several of these were rapidly downregulated by transient exposure to serotonin, a modulatory neurotransmitter released during learning. Further characterization of the brain-enriched miRNAs revealed that miR-124, the most abundant and well-conserved brain-specific miRNA, was exclusively present presynaptically in a sensory-motor synapse where it constrains serotonin-induced synaptic facilitation through regulation of the transcriptional factor CREB. We therefore present direct evidence that a modulatory neurotransmitter important for learning can regulate the levels of small RNAs and present a role for miR-124 in long-term plasticity of synapses in the mature nervous system.",

        "Abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) plays a critical role in modulating synaptic plasticity in the marine mollusc Aplysia and in the mammalian nervous system. In Aplysia sensory neurons, 5-HT can activate several signal cascades, including PKA and PKC, presumably via distinct types of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the molecular identities of these receptors have not yet been identified. We here report the cloning and functional characterization of a 5-HT receptor that is positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase in Aplysia neurons. The cloned receptor, 5-HT(apAC1), stimulates the production of cAMP in HEK293T cells and in Xenopus oocytes. Moreover, the knockdown of 5-HT(apAC1) expression by RNA interference blocked 5-HT-induced cAMP production in Aplysia sensory neurons and blocked synaptic facilitation in nondepressed or partially depressed sensory-to-motor neuron synapses. These data implicate 5-HT(apAC1) as a major modulator of learning related synaptic facilitation in the direct sensory to motor neuron pathway of the gill withdrawal reflex.",

(2006) generated transgenic mice that selectively overexpress the D2 receptor in striatum (D2OE). Drew et al. (2007) reported that D2OE mice display deficits in interval timing and motivation. The present study further explored the impaired timing in D2OE mice. Experiment 1 assessed the role of motivation in producing timing deficits in the peak procedure and found that performance in D2OE mice was improved by increasing motivation. In addition, performance was impaired in control mice when motivation was decreased. In Experiment 2, we found that D2OE mice have no timing impairment when tested using the bisection task, a procedure in which the measure of timing performance is less influenced by motivation to respond. In Experiment 3, we also used the bisection task and found selective impairment in timing of long durations in D2OE mice. These results suggest that striatal D2 overexpression impairs timing by decreasing motivation and through its impact on working memory and/or sustained attention.",

        "Abstract": "A key question in the analysis of hippocampal memory relates to how attention modulates the encoding and long-term retrieval of spatial and nonspatial representations in this region. To address this question, we recorded from single cells over a period of 5 days in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus while mice acquired one of two goal-oriented tasks. These tasks required the animals to find a hidden food reward by attending to either the visuospatial environment or a particular odor presented in shifting spatial locations. Attention to the visuospatial environment increased the stability of visuospatial representations and phase locking to gamma oscillations--a form of neuronal synchronization thought to underlie the attentional mechanism necessary for processing task-relevant information. Attention to a spatially shifting olfactory cue compromised the stability of place fields and increased the stability of reward-associated odor representations, which were most consistently retrieved during periods of sniffing and digging when animals were restricted to the cup locations. Together, these results suggest that attention selectively modulates the encoding and retrieval of hippocampal representations by enhancing physiological responses to task-relevant information.",

        "Abstract": "The hippocampus is critically involved in storing explicit memory such as memory for space. A defining feature of explicit memory storage is that it requires attention both for encoding and retrieval. Whereas, a great deal is now known about the mechanisms of storage, the mechanisms whereby attention modulates the encoding and retrieval of space and other hippocampus-dependent memory representations are not known. In this review we discuss recent studies, including our own, which show on the cellular level that attention is critical for the stabilization of spatial and reward-associated odour representations. Our findings support the view that in the hippocampus attention selects the reference frame for task-relevant information. This mechanism is in part mediated by dopamine acting through D1/D5 receptors and involves an increase in neuronal synchronization in the gamma band frequency. We propose that synchronous activity leads to enhancements in synaptic strength that mediate the stabilization of hippocampal representations.",

In the past two decades, however, technical advances in genetics and brain imaging have provided new insights into the biology of the disease. Based on these advances we are now in a position to develop animal models that can be used to test specific hypotheses of the disease and explore mechanisms of pathogenesis.

        "Abstract": "Transsynaptic interactions between neurons are essential during both developmental and learning-related synaptic growth. We have used Aplysia neuronal cultures to examine the contribution of transsynaptic signals in both types of synapse formation. We find that during de novo synaptogenesis, specific presynaptic innervation is required for the clustering of postsynaptic AMPA-like but not NMDA-like receptors. We further find that the cell adhesion molecule Dscam is involved in these transsynaptic interactions. Inhibition of Dscam either pre- or postsynaptically abolishes the emergence of synaptic transmission and the clustering of AMPA-like receptors. Remodeling of both AMPA-like and NMDA-like receptors also occurs during learning-related synapse formation and again requires the reactivation of Dscam-mediated transsynaptic interactions. Taken together, these findings suggest that learning-induced synapse formation recapitulates, at least in part, aspects of the mechanisms that govern de novo synaptogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "The activation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-dependent gene expression is thought to be critical for the formation of different types of long-term memory. To explore the consequences of chronic enhancement of CREB function on spatial memory in mammals, we examined spatial navigation in bitransgenic mice that express in a regulated and restricted manner a constitutively active form of CREB, VP16-CREB, in forebrain neurons. We found that chronic enhancement of CREB activity delayed the acquisition of an allocentric strategy to solve the hidden platform task. The ability to turn on and off transgene expression allowed us to dissect the role of CREB in dissociable memory processes. In mice in which transgene expression was turned on during memory acquisition, turning off the transgene re-established the access to the memory trace, whereas in mice in which transgene expression was turned off during acquisition, turning on the transgene impaired memory expression in a reversible manner, indicating that CREB enhancement specifically interfered with the retrieval of spatial information. The defects on spatial navigation in mice with chronic enhancement of CREB function were not corrected by conditions that increased further CREB-dependent activation of hippocampal memory systems, such as housing in an enriched environment. These results along with previous findings in CREB-deficient mutants indicate that the relationship of CREB-mediated plasticity to spatial memory is an inverted-U function, and that optimal learning in the water maze requires accurate regulation of this pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Eric R. Kandel shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Arvid Carlsson and Paul Greengard in 2000 for their discoveries concerning signal transduction in the nervous system. Eric Kandel was rewarded for his discoveries of molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory. He is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Senior Investigator at Columbia Universities Center for Neurobiology and Behavior. In this interview given at Hertie Foundation's Neuroforum 2008 on April 18, 2008 in Frankfurt, Germany, Nobel Prize Laureate Eric R. Kandel takes us on an enlighting journey ranging from memory, free will, the problem with Freud , to scientific challenges and the rise of European science. Starting with short- and long-term memory basics, underlying molecular mechanisms, and events affecting the formation of long-term memory, Eric Kandel then shares his thoughts on the issue of free will and makes a strong case for its existence. In addition to his outstanding scientific career, Eric Kandel developed an interest in business and today serves as scientific advisor at Memory Pharmaceuticals. Eric Kandel then talks about the use and abuse of drugs in children and the merging of scientific disciplines. In one of the most intriguing parts of the interview, Kandel shares his thoughts on Freud, Freud's mistakes, and the unique situation that the generations following Freud did not develop Freud's work further. The interview then turns to more scientific aspects and Eric Kandel talks about his confidence and courage during the initial phases of his scientific career, studying learning and memory, and employing a strictly reductionistic approach, best characterized by his simple model organism Aplysia. Eric Kandel then describes one of the most challenging phases in his scientific career when adult neurogenesis was discovered in the hippocampus, a structure so integral to Kandel's work. The final parts of the interview cover today's absence of epic battles and controversies and the rise of European science.",

        "Abstract": "To explore how gene products, required for the initiation of synaptic growth, move from the cell body of the sensory neuron to its presynaptic terminals, and from the cell body of the motor neuron to its postsynaptic dendritic spines, we have investigated the anterograde transport machinery in both the sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia. We found that the induction of long-term facilitation (LTF) by repeated applications of serotonin, a modulatory transmitter released during learning in Aplysia, requires upregulation of kinesin heavy chain (KHC) in both pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Indeed, upregulation of KHC in the presynaptic neurons alone is sufficient for the induction of LTF. However, KHC is not required for the persistence of LTF. Thus, in addition to transcriptional activation in the nucleus and local protein synthesis at the synapse, our studies have identified a third component critical for long-term learning-related plasticity: the coordinated upregulation of kinesin-mediated transport.",

        "Abstract": "The marine mollusk Aplysia is a useful model organism for studying the cellular bases of behavior and plasticity. However, molecular studies of Aplysia have been limited by the lack of genomic information. Recently, a large scale characterization of neuronal transcripts was performed in A. californica. Here, we report the analysis of a parallel set of neuronal transcripts from a closely related species A. kurodai found in the northwestern Pacific. We collected 4,859 nonredundant sequences from the nervous system tissue of A. kurodai. By performing microarray and real-time PCR analyses, we found that ApC/EBP, matrilin, antistasin, and eIF3e clones were significantly up-regulated and a BAT1 homologous clone was significantly down-regulated by 5-HT treatment. Among these, we further demonstrated that the Ap-eIF3e plays a key role in 5-HT-induced long-term facilitation (LTF) as a positive regulator.",

        "Abstract": "Although conditioned inhibition of fear (or learned safety) is a learning process critical for preventing chronic stress, a predisposing factor for depression and other psychopathologies, little is known about its functional purposes or molecular mechanisms. To obtain better insight into learned safety, we investigated its behavioral and molecular characteristics and found that it acts as a behavioral antidepressant in two animal models. Learned safety promotes the survival of newborn cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, while its antidepressant effect is abolished in mice with ablated hippocampal neurogenesis. Learned safety also increases the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus and leads to downregulation of genes involved in the dopaminergic and neuropeptidergic but not the serotonergic system in the basolateral amygdala. These data suggest that learned safety is an animal model of a behavioral antidepressant that shares some neuronal hallmarks of pharmacological antidepressants but is mediated by different molecular pathways.",

        "Title": "Transient and selective overexpression of D2 receptors in the striatum causes persistent deficits in conditional associative learning.",
        "Abstract": "Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are thought to derive from a hypofunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but the origin of the hypofunction is unclear. To explore the nature of this deficit, we genetically modified mice to model the increase in striatal dopamine D(2) receptors (D(2)Rs) observed in patients with schizophrenia. Previously, we reported deficits in spatial working memory tasks in these mice, congruent with the working memory deficits observed in schizophrenia. However, patients with schizophrenia suffer from deficits in many executive functions, including associative learning, planning, problem solving, and nonspatial working memory. We therefore developed operant tasks to assay two executive functions, conditional associative learning (CAL) and nonspatial working memory. Striatal D(2)R-overexpressing mice show a deficit in CAL because of perseverative behavior, caused by interference from the previous trial. D(2)R up-regulation during development was sufficient to cause this deficit, because switching off the transgene in adulthood did not rescue the phenotype. We validated prefrontal dependency of CAL by using neurotoxic lesions. Lesions of the medial PFC including the anterior cingulate, infralimbic, and prelimbic cortices impair CAL because of increased interference from previously rewarded trials, exactly as observed in D(2)R transgenic mice. In contrast, lesions restricted to the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices have no effect on CAL but impair performance in the nonspatial working memory task. These assays not only give us insight into how excess striatal D(2)Rs affect cognition but also provide tools for studying cognitive endophenotypes in mice.",

        "Abstract": "The time course of the requirement for local protein synthesis in the stabilization of learning-related synaptic growth and the persistence of long-term memory was examined using Aplysia bifurcated sensory neuron-motor neuron cultures. We find that, following repeated pulses of serotonin (5-HT), the local perfusion of emetine, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, or a TAT-AS oligonucleotide directed against ApCPEB blocks long-term facilitation (LTF) at either 24 or 48 hr and leads to a selective retraction of newly formed sensory neuron varicosities induced by 5-HT. By contrast, later inhibition of local protein synthesis, at 72 hr after 5-HT, has no effect on either synaptic growth or LTF. These results define a specific stabilization phase for the storage of long-term memory during which newly formed varicosities are labile and require sustained CPEB-dependent local protein synthesis to acquire the more stable properties of mature varicosities required for the persistence of LTF.",

        "Title": "Transcriptional regulation of long-term memory in the marine snail Aplysia.",
        "Abstract": "Whereas the induction of short-term memory involves only covalent modifications of constitutively expressed preexisting proteins, the formation of long-term memory requires gene expression, new RNA, and new protein synthesis. On the cellular level, transcriptional regulation is thought to be the starting point for a series of molecular steps necessary for both the initiation and maintenance of long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF). The core molecular features of transcriptional regulation involved in the long-term process are evolutionally conserved in Aplysia, Drosophila, and mouse, and indicate that gene regulation by the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) acting in conjunction with different combinations of transcriptional factors is critical for the expression of many forms of long-term memory. In the marine snail Aplysia, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the storage of long-term memory have been extensively studied in the monosynaptic connections between identified sensory neuron and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex. One tail shock or one pulse of serotonin (5-HT), a modulatory transmitter released by tail shocks, produces a transient facilitation mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase leading to covalent modifications in the sensory neurons that results in an enhancement of transmitter release and a strengthening of synaptic connections lasting minutes. By contrast, repeated pulses of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) induce a transcription- and translation-dependent long-term facilitation (LTF) lasting more than 24 h and trigger the activation of a family of transcription factors in the presynaptic sensory neurons including ApCREB1, ApCREB2 and ApC/EBP. In addition, we have recently identified novel transcription factors that modulate the expression of ApC/EBP and also are critically involved in LTF. In this review, we examine the roles of these transcription factors during consolidation of LTF induced by different stimulation paradigms.",

        "Abstract": "Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 1 (CPEB-1) resides at postsynaptic sites in hippocampal neurons in which it controls polyadenylation-induced translation. CPEB-1 knock-out (KO) mice display defects in some forms of synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memories. To identify CPEB-1-regulated mRNAs, we used proteomics to compare polypeptides in wild-type (WT) and CPEB-1 KO hippocampus. Growth hormone (GH) was reduced in the KO hippocampus, as were the GH signaling molecules phospho-JAK2 and phospho-STAT3. GH mRNA and pre-mRNA were reduced in the KO hippocampus, suggesting that CPEB-1 controls GH transcription. The transcription factor c-Jun, which binds the GH promoter, was also reduced in the KO hippocampus, as was its ability to coimmunoprecipitate chromatin containing the GH promoter. CPEB-1 binds c-Jun 3' untranslated region CPEs in vitro and coimmunoprecipitates c-Jun RNA in vivo. GH induces long-term potentiation (LTP) when applied to hippocampal slices from WT and CPEB-1 KO mice, but the magnitude of LTP induced by GH in KO mice is reduced. Pretreatment with GH did not reverse the LTP deficit observed in KO mice after theta-burst stimulation (TBS). Cordycepin, an inhibitor of polyadenylation, disrupted LTP induced by either GH application or TBS. Finally, GH application to hippocampal slices induced JAK2 phosphorylation in WT but not KO animals. These results indicate that CPEB-1 control of c-Jun mRNA translation regulates GH gene expression and resulting downstream signaling events (e.g., synaptic plasticity) in the mouse hippocampus.",

        "Title": "Chronic nicotine exposure induces a long-lasting and pathway-specific facilitation of LTP in the amygdala.",
        "Abstract": "Nicotine, in the form of tobacco, is the most commonly used drug of abuse. In addition to its rewarding properties, nicotine also affects many cognitive and emotional processes that involve several brain regions, including hippocampus and amygdala. Long-term changes in synaptic strength in these brain regions after drug exposure may be importantly correlated with behavioral changes induced by nicotine. Here, we study the effect of chronic oral administration of nicotine on the long-term synaptic potentiation in the amygdala, a key structure for emotional memory. We find that oral administration of nicotine for 7 d produces a significant enhancement of LTP in the amygdala. This facilitation is pathway specific: Nicotine selectively facilitates LTP in the cortical-lateral amygdala pathway, but not the thalamic-lateral and the lateral-basolateral synaptic pathway. The synaptic facilitation induced by a 7-d exposure to nicotine is long-lasting, it persists for 72 h after cessation of nicotine but decays 8 d after its cessation. In contrast, a shorter exposure of nicotine (24 h) induces only a short-lasting facilitation of synaptic plasticity that dissipates 24 and 72 h after cessation of nicotine. The facilitation of LTP in the amygdala after exposure to nicotine is mediated by removal of GABAergic inhibition, is dependent on the activation NMDA receptors, and can be prevented by blocking either alpha7 or beta2 nACh receptors. Our results indicate that chronic exposure to nicotine can promote the induction of long-lasting modifications of synapses in a specific pathway in the amygdala. These changes in synaptic plasticity may contribute to the complex neural adaptations and behaviors caused by nicotine.",

        "Abstract": "Neuroligin-1 is a potent trigger for the de novo formation of synaptic connections, and it has recently been suggested that it is required for the maturation of functionally competent excitatory synapses. Despite evidence for the role of neuroligin-1 in specifying excitatory synapses, the underlying molecular mechanisms and physiological consequences that neuroligin-1 may have at mature synapses of normal adult animals remain unknown. By silencing endogenous neuroligin-1 acutely in the amygdala of live behaving animals, we have found that neuroligin-1 is required for the storage of associative fear memory. Subsequent cellular physiological studies showed that suppression of neuroligin-1 reduces NMDA receptor-mediated currents and prevents the expression of long-term potentiation without affecting basal synaptic connectivity at the thalamo-amygdala pathway. These results indicate that persistent expression of neuroligin-1 is required for the maintenance of NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission, which enables normal development of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory in the amygdala of adult animals.",

        "Abstract": "Here we report on a phenanthridine derivative which has a covalently linked fluorescein molecule in order to increase the light absorption and hence fluorescence signal intensity when bound to duplex RNA. Steady-state fluorescence shows that the energy transfer efficiency from the fluorescein to the phenanthridine fluorophore is approximately 77%, which results in the probe being over 5x brighter than other phenanthridine derivatives when bound to RNA. Due to the relatively long lifetime (approximately 20 ns) of the probe, time-resolved fluorescence is used to increase the signal to background ratio in cell growth medium from 7 (steady-state value) to over 40. Moreover, fluorescence images of cells containing the probe show that the fluorescein signal is readily apparent along with that of the intercalated fluorophore, allowing this probe to be used as a dual color probe which simultaneously reports the probes' location and that of RNA.",

To examine the potential involvement of LTD in learning and memory, we generated transgenic mice that express a fragment of the SV40 small t antigen known to inhibit protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Small t antigen expression blocked both stimulus-induced and chemically induced NMDAR-dependent LTD at Schaffer collateral synapses but did not affect potentiation, depotentiation, or mGluR-dependent LTD. This physiological phenotype was associated with deficits in behavioral flexibility in both the Morris water maze and a delayed nonmatch to place T-maze task, suggesting that NMDAR-dependent LTD is required for behavioral flexibility and may act by weakening previously encoded memory traces when new information is learned.",

Storage of the long-term memory for sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia has been extensively studied in this respect and is associated with the growth of new synapses by the sensory neurons onto their postsynaptic target neurons. Recent time-lapse imaging studies of living sensory-to-motor neuron synapses in culture have monitored both functional and structural changes simultaneously so as to follow remodeling and growth at the same specific synaptic connections continuously over time and to examine the functional contribution of these learning-related structural changes to the different time-dependent phases of memory storage. Insights provided by these studies suggest the synaptic differentiation and growth induced by learning in the mature nervous system are highly dynamic and often rapid processes that can recruit both molecules and mechanisms used for de novo synapse formation during development.",

        "Title": "Galpha(i2) inhibition of adenylate cyclase regulates presynaptic activity and unmasks cGMP-dependent long-term depression at Schaffer collateral-CA1 hippocampal synapses.",
        "Abstract": "Cyclic AMP signaling plays a central role in regulating activity at a number of synapses in the brain. We showed previously that pairing activation of receptors that inhibit adenylate cyclase (AC) and reduce the concentration of cyclic AMP, with elevation of the concentration of cyclic GMP is sufficient to elicit a presynaptically expressed form of LTD at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. To directly test the role of AC inhibition and G-protein signaling in LTD at these synapses, we utilized transgenic mice that express a mutant, constitutively active inhibitory G protein, Galpha(i2), in principal neurons of the forebrain. Transgene expression of Galpha(i2) markedly enhanced LTD and impaired late-phase LTP at Schaffer collateral synapses, with no associated differences in input/output relations, paired-pulse facilitation, or NMDA receptor-gated conductances. When paired with application of a type V phosphodiesterase inhibitor to elevate the concentration of intracellular cyclic GMP, constitutively active Galpha(i2) expression converted the transient depression normally caused by this treatment to an LTD that persisted after the drug was washed out. Moreover, this effect could be mimicked in control slices by pairing type V phosphodiesterase inhibitor application with application of a PKA inhibitor. Electrophysiological recordings of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents and two-photon visualization of vesicular release using FM1-43 revealed that constitutively active Galpha(i2) tonically reduced basal release probability from the rapidly recycling vesicle pool of Schaffer collateral terminals. Our findings support the hypothesis that inhibitory G-protein signaling acts presynaptically to regulate release, and, when paired with elevations in the concentration of cyclic GMP, converts a transient cyclic GMP-induced depression into a long-lasting decrease in release.",

        "Abstract": "To investigate the role of CREB-mediated gene expression on the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, we obtained intracellular recordings from pyramidal neurons of transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active form of CREB, VP16-CREB, in a regulated and restricted manner. We found that transgene expression increased the neuronal excitability and inhibited the slow and medium afterhyperpolarization currents. These changes may contribute to the reduced threshold for LTP observed in these mice. When strong transgene expression was turned on for prolonged period of time, these mice also showed a significant loss of hippocampal neurons and sporadic epileptic seizures. These deleterious effects were dose dependent and could be halted, but not reversed by turning off transgene expression. Our experiments reveal a new role for hippocampal CREB-mediated gene expression, identify the slow afterhyperpolarization as a primary target of CREB action, provide a new mouse model to investigate temporal lobe epilepsy and associated neurodegeneration, and illustrate the risks of cell death associated to a sustained manipulation of this pathway. As a result, our study has important implications for both the understanding of the cellular bases of learning and memory and the consideration of therapies targeted to the CREB pathway.",

        "Title": "Transient overexpression of striatal D2 receptors impairs operant motivation and interval timing.",
        "Abstract": "The striatum receives prominent dopaminergic innervation that is integral to appetitive learning, performance, and motivation. Signaling through the dopamine D2 receptor is critical for all of these processes. For instance, drugs with high affinity for the D2 receptor potently alter timing of operant responses and modulate motivation. Recently, in an attempt to model a genetic abnormality encountered in schizophrenia, mice were generated that reversibly overexpress D2 receptors specifically in the striatum (Kellendonk et al., 2006). These mice have impairments in working memory and behavioral flexibility, components of the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, that are not rescued when D2 overexpression is reversed in the adult. Here we report that overexpression of striatal D2 receptors also profoundly affects operant performance, a potential index of negative symptoms. Mice overexpressing D2 exhibited impairments in the ability to time food rewards in an operant interval timing task and reduced motivation to lever press for food reward in both the operant timing task and a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. The motivational deficit, but not the timing deficit, was rescued in adult mice by reversing D2 overexpression with doxycycline. These results suggest that early D2 overexpression alters the organization of interval timing circuits and confirms that striatal D2 signaling in the adult regulates motivational process. Moreover, overexpression of D2 under pathological conditions such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease could give rise to motivational and timing deficits.",

        "Abstract": "Activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy are thought to be the key cellular mechanism for the formation and storage of both explicit and implicit memory. Different patterns of stimulation can elicit different changes in the efficiency on excitatory synaptic transmission. Here, we examined the synaptic changes in the amygdala of adult mice produced by low-frequency stimulation (1 Hz, 15 min, LFS). We first compared the synaptic changes induced by LFS in three different synaptic pathways of amygdala: cortical-lateral amygdala, thalamic-lateral amygdala, and lateral-basolateral amygdala pathways. We find that the plastic changes induced by LFS are different between synaptic pathways. Low-frequency stimulation selectively elicits a slow onset and protein synthesis-dependent late-phase LTP in the cortical-lateral amygdala pathway, but not in the thalamic-lateral or lateral-basolateral pathways. We next analyzed LTP induced by LFS in the cortical-lateral amygdala pathway and found that three PKA-coupling neurotransmitter receptors are involved: 5-HT4, Dopamine D1, and beta-adrenergic receptors. Antagonists of these receptors block the LFS L-LTP, but the effects of agonists of these receptors are clearly different. These results indicate that the threshold for the induction of LFS L-LTP is different among these pathways and that the maintenance of LFS L-LTP requires a cross-talk among multiple neurotransmitters.",

        "Abstract": "Repeated pulses of serotonin (5-HT) induce long-term facilitation (LTF) of the synapses between sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia. To explore how apCAM downregulation at the plasma membrane and CREB-mediated transcription in the nucleus, both of which are required for the formation of LTF, might relate to each other, we cloned an apCAM-associated protein (CAMAP) by yeast two-hybrid screening. We found that 5-HT signaling at the synapse activates PKA which in turn phosphorylates CAMAP to induce the dissociation of CAMAP from apCAM and the subsequent translocation of CAMAP into the nucleus of sensory neurons. In the nucleus, CAMAP acts as a transcriptional coactivator for CREB1 and is essential for the activation of ApC/EBP required for the initiation of LTF. Combined, our data suggest that CAMAP is a retrograde signaling component that translocates from activated synapses to the nucleus during synapse-specific LTF.",

        "Abstract": "The amygdala is a critical site for the acquisition of learned fear memory in mammals, and the formation and long-term maintenance of fear memories are thought to be associated with changes of synaptic strength in the amygdala. Here we report that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), a modulatory neurotransmitter known to be linked to learned fearful and emotional behavior, has dual effects on excitatory synaptic transmission in the basolateral amygdala. There is an early depression of synaptic transmission lasting 30-50 min, mediated by 5-HT1A, and a late, long-lasting facilitation lasting >5 h in slice recordings, mediated by the 5-HT4 receptor. 5-HT late phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) is blocked by inhibitors of either protein kinase A (PKA) and/or mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) and requires new protein synthesis and gene transcription. Moreover, the 5-HT-induced L-LTP in neurons of amygdala is blocked by the actin inhibitor cytochalasin D, suggesting that 5-HT stimulates a cytoskeletal rearrangement. These results show, for the first time, that 5-HT can produce long-lasting facilitation of synaptic transmission in the amygdala and provides evidence for the possible synaptic role of 5-HT in long-term memory for learned fear.",

        "Abstract": "To explore the function of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, we ablated cell proliferation by using two independent and complementary methods: (i) a focal hippocampal irradiation and (ii) an inducible and reversible genetic elimination of neural progenitor cells. Previous studies using these methods found a weakening of contextual fear conditioning but no change in spatial reference memory, suggesting a supportive role for neurogenesis in some, but not all, hippocampal-dependent memory tasks. In the present study, we examined hippocampal-dependent and -independent working memory using different radial maze tasks. Surprisingly, ablating neurogenesis caused an improvement of hippocampal-dependent working memory when repetitive information was presented in a single day. These findings suggest that adult-born cells in the dentate gyrus have different, and in some cases, opposite roles in distinct types of memory.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular analyses of Aplysia, a well-established model organism for cellular and systems neural science, have been seriously handicapped by a lack of adequate genomic information. By sequencing cDNA libraries from the central nervous system (CNS), we have identified over 175,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), of which 19,814 are unique neuronal gene products and represent 50%-70% of the total Aplysia neuronal transcriptome. We have characterized the transcriptome at three levels: (1) the central nervous system, (2) the elementary components of a simple behavior: the gill-withdrawal reflex-by analyzing sensory, motor, and serotonergic modulatory neurons, and (3) processes of individual neurons. In addition to increasing the amount of available gene sequences of Aplysia by two orders of magnitude, this collection represents the largest database available for any member of the Lophotrochozoa and therefore provides additional insights into evolutionary strategies used by this highly successful diversified lineage, one of the three proposed superclades of bilateral animals.",

        "Abstract": "Much is known about the neurobiology of memory storage for learned fear. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms underlying extinction of fear memory are just beginning to be delineated. Here, we investigate the role of protein kinase A (PKA) in extinction of memory for contextual fear by using conventional and temporally regulated transgenic approaches that allow us to inhibit PKA activity in neurons within brain regions thought to be involved in extinction. Strikingly, reduction of PKA activity facilitated the development of extinction, without interfering with storage of the original fear memory. Moreover, inhibition of PKA facilitated extinction of both recent and remote contextual fear memories. The finding that PKA, which is required for the acquisition of fear memory, is a constraint for extinction provides the first genetic support for the idea that fear extinction is itself a genuine learning process with its own specific molecular requirements, rather than simply the erasure of a previously learned process. Further, these experiments represent the first genetic evidence that protein kinases may be constraints for the extinction of fear.",

        "Abstract": "The cAMP/PKA pathway plays a critical role in learning and memory systems in animals ranging from mice to Drosophila to Aplysia. Studies of olfactory learning in Drosophila suggest that altered expression of either positive or negative regulators of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway beyond a certain optimum range may be deleterious. Here we provide genetic evidence of the behavioral and physiological effects of increased signaling through the cAMP/PKA pathway in mice. We have generated transgenic mice in which the expression of a constitutively active form of Gsalpha (Gsalpha* Q227L), the G protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity, is driven in neurons within the forebrain by the promoter from the CaMKIIalpha gene. Despite significantly increased adenylyl cyclase activity, Gsalpha* transgenic mice exhibit PKA-dependent decreases in levels of cAMP due to a compensatory up-regulation in phosphodiesterase activity. Interestingly, Gsalpha* transgenic mice also exhibit enhanced basal synaptic transmission. Consistent with a role for the cAMP/PKA pathway in learning and memory, Gsalpha* transgenic mice show impairments in spatial learning in the Morris water maze and in contextual and cued fear conditioning tasks. The learning deficits observed in these transgenic mice suggest that associative and spatial learning requires regulated Gsalpha protein signaling, much as does olfactory learning in Drosophila.",

        "Abstract": "The C957T polymorphism in the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene and the Val158Met polymorphism in the Catechol-O-Methyl-Transferase (COMT) gene affect dopamine transmission and have been found to be associated with schizophrenia. Since DRD2 in mice and the COMT gene in humans modulate working memory, we examined the relationship and possible interaction of both polymorphisms to working memory performance in 188 healthy adults. Subjects having the DRD2 C/C allele showed the poorest performance in a word serial position test. Moreover, the effect of the C957T genotype was strengthened when interaction with the COMT Val158Met polymorphism was included in the analysis. We propose that an interaction of the DRD2 C957T and COMT Val158Met may be involved in the generation of some working memory deficits in schizophrenia.",

        "Abstract": "Although hippocampal neurogenesis has been described in many adult mammals, the functional impact of this process on physiology and behavior remains unclear. In the present study, we used two independent methods to ablate hippocampal neurogenesis and found that each procedure caused a limited behavioral deficit and a loss of synaptic plasticity within the dentate gyrus. Specifically, focal X irradiation of the hippocampus or genetic ablation of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive neural progenitor cells impaired contextual fear conditioning but not cued conditioning. Hippocampal-dependent spatial learning tasks such as the Morris water maze and Y maze were unaffected. These findings show that adult-born neurons make a distinct contribution to some but not all hippocampal functions. In a parallel set of experiments, we show that long-term potentiation elicited in the dentate gyrus in the absence of GABA blockers requires the presence of new neurons, as it is eliminated by each of our ablation procedures. These data show that new hippocampal neurons can be preferentially recruited over mature granule cells in vitro and may provide a framework for how this small cell population can influence behavior.",

        "Abstract": "The functional role of releasable Zn2+ in the central nervous system remains unknown. Here we show that zinc transporter 3 (ZnT-3), which maintains a high concentration of Zn2+ in synaptic vesicles and serves as a marker for zinc-containing neurons, is enriched in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala and in the temporal area 3 of the auditory cortex, an area that conveys information about the auditory conditioned stimulus to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, but not in other conditioned stimulus areas located in the auditory thalamus. Using whole-cell recordings from amygdala slices, we demonstrated that activity-dependent release of chelatable Zn2+ is required for the induction of spike timing-dependent long-term potentiation in cortical input to the amygdala implicated in fear learning. Our data indicate that synaptically released Zn2+ enables long-term potentiation at the cortico-amygdala synapses by depressing feed-forward GABAergic inhibition of principal neurons. This regulatory mechanism, implicating pathway-dependent release of Zn2+, may serve an essential control function in assuring spatial specificity of long-lasting synaptic modifications in the neural circuit of a learned behavior.",

        "Abstract": "Effective mental functioning requires that cognition be protected from emotional conflict due to interference by task-irrelevant emotionally salient stimuli. The neural mechanisms by which the brain detects and resolves emotional conflict are still largely unknown, however. Drawing on the classic Stroop conflict task, we developed a protocol that allowed us to dissociate the generation and monitoring of emotional conflict from its resolution. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we find that activity in the amygdala and dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices reflects the amount of emotional conflict. By contrast, the resolution of emotional conflict is associated with activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. Activation of the rostral cingulate is predicted by the amount of previous-trial conflict-related neural activity and is accompanied by a simultaneous and correlated reduction of amygdalar activity. These data suggest that emotional conflict is resolved through top-down inhibition of amygdalar activity by the rostral cingulate cortex.",

        "Abstract": "Long-term memory requires transcriptional regulation by a combination of positive and negative transcription factors. Aplysia activating factor (ApAF) is known to be a positive transcription factor that forms heterodimers with ApC/EBP and ApCREB2. How these heterodimers are regulated and how they participate in the consolidation of long-term facilitation (LTF) has not, however, been characterized. We found that the functional activation of ApAF required phosphorylation of ApAF by PKA on Ser-266. In addition, ApAF lowered the threshold of LTF by forming a heterodimer with ApCREB2. Moreover, once activated by PKA, the ApAF-ApC/EBP heterodimer transactivates enhancer response element-containing genes and can induce LTF in the absence of CRE- and CREB-mediated gene expression. Collectively, these results suggest that PKA-activated ApAF-ApC/EBP heterodimer is a core downstream effector of ApCREB in the consolidation of LTF.",

        "Abstract": "Protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP (L-LTP) is typically induced by repeated high-frequency stimulation (HFS). This form of L-LTP is reduced in the aged animal and is positively correlated with age-related memory loss. Here we report a novel form of protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampus induced by a brief 1-Hz paired-pulse stimulation (PP-1 Hz, 1 min). In contrast to L-LTP induced by HFS, the late phase of PP-1 Hz LTP does not exist in young adult animals. Rather, it emerges and becomes enhanced in an age-related way. Thus, in 1.5- to 2-mo-old mice, a brief PP-1 Hz stimulation induces only a short lasting LTP, decaying to baseline in about 90 min. By contrast, PP-1 Hz stimulation induces an enduring and protein synthesis dependent LTP in 12- to 18-mo-old mice. The PP-1 Hz-induced L-LTP is dependent on NMDA receptor activation, requires voltage-dependent calcium channels, and is modulated by dopamine D1/D5 receptors. Because memory ability declines with aging, the age-related enhancement of L-LTP induced by PP-1 Hz stimulation indicates that this form of L-LTP appears to be inversely correlated with memory ability.",

        "Title": "Dishabituation in Aplysia can involve either reversal of habituation or superimposed sensitization.",
        "Abstract": "Dishabituation has been thought to be due either to reversal of the process of habituation or to a second process equivalent to sensitization superimposed on habituation. One way to address this question is by testing whether dishabituation and sensitization can be dissociated. Previous studies using this approach in Aplysia have come to different conclusions about the nature of dishabituation, perhaps because those studies differed in many respects, including (1) whether they also observed transient behavioral inhibition, and (2) whether they used test stimuli that activated the LE siphon sensory neurons or as yet unidentified sensory neurons. To attempt to resolve the apparent contradictions between the previous studies, we have explored the importance of these two factors by performing a parametric study of dishabituation and sensitization of gill withdrawal in a simplified preparation that does not exhibit transient behavioral inhibition, using two different test stimuli that are known to activate the LE (Touch) or unidentified (Not Touch) sensory neurons. We find that dishabituation and sensitization in this preparation have similar time courses and generally similar functions of shock intensity. However, under one condition, with the Not Touch stimulus 2.5 min after the shock, dishabituation has a reverse effect of shock intensity. Additional analyses suggest that dishabituation with the Not Touch stimulus 2.5 min after the shock is due to reversal of habituation, whereas 12.5 min after the shock, dishabituation is due to superimposed sensitization. These results thus suggest that dishabituation may involve either process in the same preparation, and begin to define the conditions that favor one or the other.",

        "Abstract": "Presynaptic inhibitory G protein-coupled receptors play a critical role in regulating transmission at a number of synapses in the central and peripheral nervous system. We generated transgenic mice that express a constitutively active form of an inhibitory Galpha subunit to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of one such receptor, metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) 2, at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in the hippocampus. mGluR2 participates in at least three types of mossy fiber synaptic plasticity, (i) transient suppression of synaptic transmission, (ii) long-term depression (LTD), and (iii) inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP), and we find that inhibitory Galpha signaling is sufficient to account for the actions of mGluR2 in each. The fact that constitutively active Galphai2 occludes the transient suppression of synaptic transmission by mGluR2, while enhancing LTD, suggests further that these two forms of plasticity are expressed via different mechanisms. In addition, the LTP deficit observed in constitutively active Galphai2-expressing mice suggests that mGluR2 activation may serve as a metaplastic switch to permit the induction of LTD by inhibiting LTP.",

        "Abstract": "Whereas significant insight exists as to how LTP-related changes can contribute to the formation of long-term memory, little is known about the role of hippocampal LTD-like changes in learning and memory storage. We describe a mouse lacking the transcription factor SRF in the adult forebrain. This mouse could not acquire a hippocampus-based immediate memory for a novel context even across a few minute timespan, which led to a profound but selective deficit in explicit spatial memory. These animals were also impaired in the induction of LTD, including LTD triggered by a cholinergic agonist. Moreover, genes regulating two processes essential for LTD-calcium release from intracellular stores and phosphatase activation-were abnormally expressed in knockouts. These findings suggest that for the hippocampus to form associative spatial memories through LTP-like processes, it must first undergo learning of the context per se through exploration and the learning of familiarity, which requires LTD-like processes.",

        "Abstract": "The striatum has a well documented role in procedural learning and memory. However, the synaptic and molecular mechanisms of acquisition and storage of this form of memory remain poorly understood. We examined procedural memory and plasticity in transgenic mice reversibly expressing a dominant-negative cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) mutant in the dorsal striatum. In these transgenic mice, corticostriatal long-term potentiation and depression are abolished, indicating that CREB function is essential for bidirectional long-term synaptic plasticity in this structure. Importantly, CREB-deficient animals show reversible alterations in several forms of striatum-dependent memory, including footshock avoidance learning and \"response\" learning in the cross maze. These findings implicate transcriptional regulation by CREB family transcription factors in striatum-dependent information processing and provide the first clear correlation between procedural learning and memory and synaptic plasticity at the corticostriatal synapse.",

        "Title": "Operant conditioning of gill withdrawal in Aplysia.",
        "Abstract": "A basic question in neuroscience is how different forms of learning are related. To further address that question, we examined whether gill withdrawal in Aplysia, which has already been studied extensively for neuronal mechanisms contributing to habituation, sensitization, and classical conditioning, also undergoes operant conditioning. Animals were run in pairs. During the initial training period, the contingent (experimental) animal received a siphon shock each time its gill relaxed below a criterion level, and the yoked control animal received a shock whenever the experimental animal did, regardless of its own gill position. This was followed by an extinction period when there was no shock, a retraining period when both animals were contingent, and another extinction period. The experimental animals spent more time with their gills contracted above the criterion level than did the control animals during each period, demonstrating operant conditioning. The type of gill behavior modified by learning shifted over time: the experimental animals had a larger increase in the frequency and duration of spontaneous contractions than did the control animals during the first but not the last extinction period and a larger increase in the level of tonic contraction during the last but not the first extinction period. Because many of the neurons controlling spontaneous and tonic gill withdrawal have already been identified, it should now be possible to examine the cellular locus and mechanism of operant conditioning and compare them with those for other forms of learning of the same behavior.",

        "Abstract": "Increased activity of D2 receptors (D2Rs) in the striatum has been linked to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. To determine directly the behavioral and physiological consequences of increased D2R function in the striatum, we generated mice with reversibly increased levels of D2Rs restricted to the striatum. D2 transgenic mice exhibit selective cognitive impairments in working memory tasks and behavioral flexibility without more general cognitive deficits. The deficit in the working memory task persists even after the transgene has been switched off, indicating that it results not from continued overexpression of D2Rs but from excess expression during development. To determine the effects that may mediate the observed cognitive deficits, we analyzed the prefrontal cortex, the brain structure mainly associated with working memory. We found that D2R overexpression in the striatum impacts dopamine levels, rates of dopamine turnover, and activation of D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex, measures that are critical for working memory.",

        "Abstract": "Studies in the rodent hippocampus have demonstrated that when the late phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) is induced in a set of synapses by suprathreshold stimulation, L-LTP can also be expressed by other synapses receiving subthreshold stimulation, a phenomenon usually referred as \"capture of L-LTP.\" Because the pyramidal neurons in the mammalian hippocampus have both apical and basal dendrites, we have now investigated whether capture of L-LTP, previously described only within the apical dendritic compartment, can also take place within the basilar dendritic compartment and, if so, whether capture can be accomplished from one dendritic compartment to the other. We found that capture of L-LTP can also occur within the basilar dendritic compartment and that the tagging signal that enables capture appears to be the same in both dendritic compartments. However, capture across compartments, between the apical and basilar dendrites, follows different rules and requires a stronger triggering stimulation than capture within a compartment. These results suggest that the tag appears specific to a compartment either apical or basilar and that an additional mechanism may be required to capture across compartments.",

        "Abstract": "Remodeling chromatin is essential for cAMP-regulated gene expression, necessary not only for development but also for memory storage and other enduring mental states. Histone acetylation and deacetylation mediate long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity in Aplysia as well as cognition in mice. Here, we show that histone acetylation by the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) mediates sensitivity to cocaine by regulating expression of the fosB gene and its splice variant, DeltafosB, a transcription factor previously implicated in addiction. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with antibodies against histone H4 or CBP, we find that CBP is recruited to the fosB promoter to acetylate histone H4 in response to acute exposure to cocaine. We show that mutant mice that lack one allele of the CBP gene and have normal levels of fosB expression are less sensitive to chronic (10-day) administration of cocaine than are wild-type mice. This decreased sensitivity is correlated with decreased histone acetylation and results in decreased fosB expression and diminished accumulation of DeltafosB. Thus, CBP, which forms part of the promoter complex with CREB, mediates sensitivity to cocaine by acetylating histones.",

This form of LTP requires activation of transcription and translation and results in the cell-wide distribution of gene products that can be captured by other marked synapses. Here we report that theta frequency stimulation (5 Hz, 30 sec) applied to the Schaeffer-collateral pathway can induce a form of late phase of LTP that is restricted locally to the dendritic compartment. The late phase of theta frequency LTP is maintained even in isolated CA1 dendrites and is dependent on dendritic translation and actin cytoskeletal regulation, but is independent of transcription. This local form of L-LTP is not accessible to synaptic capture by other synapses, indicating that this form of LTP is restricted to the synaptic compartment. These results indicate that different patterns of synaptic stimulation can induce distinct forms of LTP that may have different roles in memory storage.",

        "Abstract": "Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of learned and innate fear. We have identified stathmin, an inhibitor of microtubule formation, as highly expressed in the lateral nucleus (LA) of the amygdala as well as in the thalamic and cortical structures that send information to the LA about the conditioned (learned fear) and unconditioned stimuli (innate fear). Whole-cell recordings from amygdala slices that are isolated from stathmin knockout mice show deficits in spike-timing-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). The knockout mice also exhibit decreased memory in amygdala-dependent fear conditioning and fail to recognize danger in innately aversive environments. By contrast, these mice do not show deficits in the water maze, a spatial task dependent on the hippocampus, where stathmin is not normally expressed. We therefore conclude that stathmin is required for the induction of LTP in afferent inputs to the amygdala and is essential in regulating both innate and learned fear.",

        "Abstract": "Expression of VP16-CREB, a constitutively active form of CREB, in hippocampal neurons of the CA1 region lowers the threshold for eliciting the late, persistent phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway. This VP16-CREB-mediated L-LTP differs from the conventional late phase of LTP in not being dependent on new transcription. This finding suggests that in the transgenic mice the mRNA transcript(s) encoding the protein(s) necessary for this form of L-LTP might already be present in CA1 neurons in the basal condition. We used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to identify the mRNAs differentially expressed in the hippocampus of transgenic and wild-type mice. We then explored the contribution of the most prominent candidate genes revealed by our screening, namely prodynorphin, BDNF, and MHC class I molecules, to the facilitated LTP of VP16-CREB mice. We found that the overexpression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor accounts for an important component of this phenotype.",

        "Abstract": "Rho GTPases are key transducers of integrin/extracellular matrix and growth factor signaling. Although integrin-mediated adhesion and trophic support suppress neuronal apoptosis, the role of Rho GTPases in neuronal survival is unclear. Here, we have identified Rac as a critical pro-survival GTPase in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) and elucidated a death pathway triggered by its inactivation. GTP-loading of Rac1 was maintained in CGNs by integrin-mediated (RGD-dependent) cell attachment and trophic support. Clostridium difficile toxin B (ToxB), a specific Rho family inhibitor, induced a selective caspase-mediated degradation of Rac1 without affecting RhoA or Cdc42 protein levels. Both ToxB and dominant-negative N17Rac1 elicited CGN apoptosis, characterized by cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-9 and -3, whereas dominant-negative N19RhoA or N17Cdc42 did not cause significant cell death. ToxB stimulated mitochondrial translocation and conformational activation of Bax, c-Jun activation, and induction of the BH3-only protein Bim. Similarly, c-Jun activation and Bim induction were observed with N17Rac1. A c-jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK)/p38 inhibitor, SB203580, and a JNK-specific inhibitor, SP600125, significantly decreased ToxB-induced Bim expression and blunted each subsequent step of the apoptotic cascade. These results indicate that Rac acts downstream of integrins and growth factors to promote neuronal survival by repressing c-Jun/Bim-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis.",

        "Abstract": "The synaptic vesicle protein Rab3A is a small GTP-binding protein that interacts with rabphilin and RIM1alpha, two presynaptic substrates of protein kinase A (PKA). Mice lacking RIM1alpha and Rab3A have a defect in PKA-dependent and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-independent presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal mossy-fiber and cerebellar parallel-fiber synapses. In contrast, the NMDAR-dependent and PKA-independent early phase of LTP at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses does not require these presynaptic proteins. Here, we ask whether Rab3A and RIM1alpha participate in forms of LTP that require both PKA and NMDAR activation. We find that Rab3A is necessary for corticoamygdala LTP and late-phase LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses, two forms of LTP that require NMDAR and PKA activation. The latter form of LTP also requires RIM1alpha. These results provide genetic evidence that presynaptic proteins are required in LTP induced through the postsynaptic activation of NMDARs. Thus Rab3A and its effectors are general modules for four distinct types of PKA-dependent LTP in the brain.",

We studied electrophysiological and affective correlates of learned safety by negatively correlating an auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) with aversive events (US). This CS came to signify a period of protection, reducing fear responses to predictors of the US and increasing adventurous exploration of a novel environment. In nonaversive conditions, mice turn on the CS when given the opportunity. Thus, conditioned safety involves a reduction of learned and instinctive fear, as well as positive affective responses. Concurrent electrophysiological measurements identified a safety learning-induced long-lasting depression of CS-evoked activity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, consistent with fear reduction, and an increase of CS-evoked activity in a region of the striatum involved in positive affect, euphoric responses, and reward.",

        "Abstract": "Application of Clostridium difficile toxin B, an inhibitor of the Rho family of GTPases, at the Aplysia sensory to motor neuron synapse blocks long-term facilitation and the associated growth of new sensory neuron varicosities induced by repeated pulses of serotonin (5-HT). We have isolated cDNAs encoding Aplysia Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 and found that Rho and Rac had no effect but that overexpression in sensory neurons of a dominant-negative mutant of ApCdc42 or the CRIB domains of its downstream effectors PAK and N-WASP selectively reduces the long-term changes in synaptic strength and structure. FRET analysis indicates that 5-HT activates ApCdc42 in a subset of varicosities contacting the postsynaptic motor neuron and that this activation is dependent on the PI3K and PLC signaling pathways. The 5-HT-induced activation of ApCdc42 initiates reorganization of the presynaptic actin network leading to the outgrowth of filopodia, some of which are morphological precursors for the learning-related formation of new sensory neuron varicosities.",

        "Abstract": "Recent results suggest that long-lasting potentiation at hippocampal synapses involves the rapid formation of clusters or puncta of presynaptic as well as postsynaptic proteins, both of which are blocked by antagonists of NMDA receptors and an inhibitor of actin polymerization. We have investigated whether the increase in puncta involves retrograde signaling through the NO-cGMP-cGK pathway and also examined the possible roles of two classes of molecules that regulate the actin cytoskeleton: Ena/VASP proteins and Rho GTPases. Our results suggest that NO, cGMP, cGK, actin, and Rho GTPases including RhoA play important roles in the potentiation and act directly in both the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, where they contribute to the increase in puncta of synaptic proteins. cGK phosphorylates synaptic VASP during the potentiation, whereas Rho GTPases act both in parallel and upstream of cGMP, in part by maintaining the synaptic localization of soluble guanylyl cyclase.",

        "Abstract": "The subiculum (SB) is the principal target of the axons of the CA1 pyramidal cells and serves as the final relay in the trisynaptic loop between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. We have examined synaptic plasticity in the synaptic pathway between the CA1 pyramidal cells and the SB in hippocampal slices and compared it under the same experimental condition with the synaptic plasticity in Shaffer collateral pathway (CA3-CA1). We find that the frequency response curve of synaptic strength induced by prolonged low-frequency stimulation (1-5 Hz) is systematically up-shifted from Shaffer collateral to the CA1-SB pathway. The up-regulation of synaptic strength is mediated by the activity-dependent modulation by beta-adrenergic transmission. Because the CA3-CA1 and the CA1-SB synaptic pathways are in series and the beta-adrenergic modulation is region-specific, this modulation seems to be involved in the selective control of signal transmission between the different regions of hippocampus.",

        "Abstract": "Responses to threat-related stimuli are influenced by conscious and unconscious processes, but the neural systems underlying these processes and their relationship to anxiety have not been clearly delineated. Using fMRI, we investigated the neural responses associated with the conscious and unconscious (backwardly masked) perception of fearful faces in healthy volunteers who varied in threat sensitivity (Spielberger trait anxiety scale). Unconscious processing modulated activity only in the basolateral subregion of the amygdala, while conscious processing modulated activity only in the dorsal amygdala (containing the central nucleus). Whereas activation of the dorsal amygdala by conscious stimuli was consistent across subjects and independent of trait anxiety, activity in the basolateral amygdala to unconscious stimuli, and subjects' reaction times, were predicted by individual differences in trait anxiety. These findings provide a biological basis for the unconscious emotional vigilance characteristic of anxiety and a means for investigating the mechanisms and efficacy of treatments for anxiety.",

        "Abstract": "The importance of long-term synaptic plasticity as a cellular substrate for learning and memory is well established. By contrast, little is known about how learning and memory are regulated by voltage-gated ion channels that integrate synaptic information. We investigated this question using mice with general or forebrain-restricted knockout of the HCN1 gene, which we find encodes a major component of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih) and is an important determinant of dendritic integration in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Deletion of HCN1 from forebrain neurons enhances hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, augments the power of theta oscillations, and enhances long-term potentiation (LTP) at the direct perforant path input to the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, but has little effect on LTP at the more proximal Schaffer collateral inputs. We suggest that HCN1 channels constrain learning and memory by regulating dendritic integration of distal synaptic inputs to pyramidal cells.",

        "Abstract": "Dendritic spines are small protrusions from dendritic shafts that contain the postsynaptic sites of glutamatergic synapses in the brain. Spines undergo dramatic activity-dependent structural changes that are particularly prominent during neuronal development. Although changes in spine shape or number have been proposed to contribute to forms of synaptic plasticity that underlie learning and memory, the extent to which spines remain plastic in the adult brain is unclear. We find that induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in acute hippocampal slices of adult mice evokes a reliable, transient expansion in spines that are synaptically activated, as determined with calcium imaging. Similar to LTP, transient spine expansion requires N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx and actin polymerization. Moreover, like the early phase of LTP induced by the stimulation protocol, spine expansion does not require Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels nor does it require protein synthesis. Thus, transient spine expansion is a characteristic feature of the initial phases of plasticity at mature synapses and so may contribute to synapse remodeling important for LTP.",

        "Abstract": "Inhibitors in myelin play a major role in preventing spontaneous axonal regeneration after CNS injury. Elevation of cAMP overcomes this inhibition, in a transcription-dependent manner, through the upregulation of Arginase I (Arg I) and increased synthesis of polyamines. Here, we show that the cAMP effect requires activation of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) to overcome myelin inhibitors; a dominant-negative CREB abolishes the effect, and neurons expressing a constitutively active form of CREB are not inhibited. Activation of CREB is also required for cAMP to upregulate Arg I, and the ability of constitutively active CREB to overcome inhibition is blocked by an inhibitor of polyamine synthesis. Finally, expression of constitutively active CREB in DRG neurons is sufficient to promote regeneration of subsequently lesioned dorsal column axons. These results indicate that CREB plays a central role in overcoming myelin inhibitors and so encourages regeneration in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "The adult cerebral cortex can adapt to environmental change. Using monocular deprivation as a paradigm, we find that rapid experience-dependent plasticity exists even in the mature primary visual cortex. However, adult cortical plasticity differs from developmental plasticity in two important ways. First, the effect of adult, but not juvenile monocular deprivation is strongly suppressed by administration of barbiturate just prior to recording visual evoked potentials, suggesting that the effect of adult experience can be inactivated acutely. Second, the effect of deprivation is less persistent over time in adults than in juveniles. This correlates with the known decline in CREB function during maturation of the visual cortex. To compensate for this decline in CREB function, we expressed persistently active VP16-CREB and find that it causes adult plasticity to become persistent. These results suggest that in development and adulthood, the regulation of a trans-synaptic signaling pathway controls the adaptive potential of cortical circuits.",

For both forms of memory storage, some type of synaptic growth is thought to represent the stable cellular change that maintains the long-term process. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the molecular events that underlie learning-related synaptic growth in Aplysia and discuss the possibility that an active, prion-based mechanism is important for the maintenance of the structural change and for the persistence of long-term memory.",

        "Abstract": "We previously reported that five repeated pulses of 5-HT lead to down-regulation of the TM-apCAM isoform at the surface of Aplysia sensory neurons (SNs). We here examined whether apCAM down-regulation is required for 5-HT-induced long-term facilitation. We also analyzed the role of the cytoplasmic and extracellular domains by overexpressing various apCAM mutants by DNA microinjection. When TM-apCAM was up-regulated in SNs by DNA microinjection, five pulses of 5-HT failed to produce either synaptic facilitation or an enhancement of synaptic growth, suggesting that down-regulation of apCAM is required for 5-HT-induced EPSP enhancement and new varicosity formation. However, disrupting the extracellular domain function of overexpressed apCAM with a specific antibody restored 5-HT-induced excitatory postsynaptic potential increase but not synaptic growth. The overexpression of the MAP Kinase mutant of TM-apCAM, which is not internalized by 5-HT, inhibited new varicosity formation, but did not inhibit excitatory postsynaptic potential increase. Deletion mutants containing only the cytoplasmic portion of apCAM blocked 5-HT-induced synaptic growth but not excitatory postsynaptic potential increase. Thus, our data suggest that TM-apCAM may act as a suppressor of both synaptic-strength enhancement in pre-existing synapses and of new synaptic varicosity formation in the nonsynaptic region, via different mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "We studied a mouse model of the haploinsufficiency form of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS), an inheritable disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CREB binding protein (CBP) and characterized by mental retardation and skeletal abnormalities. In these mice, chromatin acetylation, some forms of long-term memory, and the late phase of hippocampal long-term potentiation (L-LTP) were impaired. We ameliorated the L-LTP deficit in two ways: (1) by enhancing the expression of CREB-dependent genes, and (2) by inhibiting histone deacetyltransferase activity (HDAC), the molecular counterpart of the histone acetylation function of CBP. Inhibition of HDAC also reversed the memory defect observed in fear conditioning. These findings suggest that some of the cognitive and physiological deficits observed on RTS are not simply due to the reduction of CBP during development but may also result from the continued requirement throughout life for both the CREB co-activation and the histone acetylation function of CBP.",

        "Title": "Selective modulation of some forms of schaffer collateral-CA1 synaptic plasticity in mice with a disruption of the CPEB-1 gene.",
        "Abstract": "CPEB-1 is a sequence-specific RNA binding protein that stimulates the polyadenylation-induced translation of mRNAs containing the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE). Although CPEB-1 was identified originally in Xenopus oocytes, it has also been found at postsynaptic sites of hippocampal neurons where, in response to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation, it is thought to induce the polyadenylation and translation of alphaCaMKII and perhaps other CPE-containing mRNAs. Because some forms of synaptic modification appear to be influenced by local (synaptic) protein synthesis, we examined long-term potentiation (LTP) in CPEB-1 knockout mice. Although the basal synaptic transmission of Schaffer collateral-CA1 neurons was not affected in the knockout mice, we found that there was a modest deficit in LTP evoked by a single train of 100 Hz stimulation, but a greater deficit in LTP evoked by one train of theta-burst stimulation. In contrast, LTP evoked by either four trains of 100 Hz stimulation or five trains of theta-burst stimulation were not or were only modestly affected, respectively. The deficit in LTP evoked by single stimulation in knockout mice appeared several minutes after tetanic stimulation. Long-term depression (LTD) evoked by 1 Hz stimulation was moderately facilitated; however, a stronger and more enduring form of LTD induced by paired-pulse 1 Hz stimulation was unaffected. These data suggest that CPEB-1 contributes in the translational control of mRNAs that is critical only for some selected forms of LTP and LTD.",

        "Abstract": "We have carried out a global survey of age-related changes in mRNA levels in the C57BL/6NIA mouse hippocampus and found a difference in the hippocampal gene expression profile between 2-month-old young mice and 15-month-old middle-aged mice correlated with an age-related cognitive deficit in hippocampal-based explicit memory formation. Middle-aged mice displayed a mild but specific deficit in spatial memory in the Morris water maze. By using Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays, we found a distinct pattern of age-related change, consisting mostly of gene overexpression in the middle-aged mice, suggesting that the induction of negative regulators in the middle-aged hippocampus could be involved in impairment of learning. Interestingly, we report changes in transcript levels for genes that could affect synaptic plasticity. Those changes could be involved in the memory deficits we observed in the 15-month-old mice. In agreement with previous reports, we also found altered expression in genes related to inflammation, protein processing, and oxidative stress.",

        "Abstract": "The hippocampal formation is critical for the acquisition and consolidation of memories. When recorded in freely moving animals, hippocampal pyramidal neurons fire in a location-specific manner: they are \"place\" cells, comprising a hippocampal representation of the animal's environment. To explore the relationship between place cells and spatial memory, we recorded from mice in several behavioral contexts. We found that long-term stability of place cell firing fields correlates with the degree of attentional demands and that successful spatial task performance was associated with stable place fields. Furthermore, conditions that maximize place field stability greatly increase orientation to novel cues. This suggests that storage and retrieval of place cells is modulated by a top-down cognitive process resembling attention and that place cells are neural correlates of spatial memory. We propose a model whereby attention provides the requisite neuromodulatation to switch short-term homosynaptic plasticity to long-term heterosynaptic plasticity, and we implicate dopamine in this process.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in presenilins are the major cause of familial Alzheimer's disease, but the pathogenic mechanism by which presenilin mutations cause memory loss and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that conditional double knockout mice lacking both presenilins in the postnatal forebrain exhibit impairments in hippocampal memory and synaptic plasticity. These deficits are associated with specific reductions in NMDA receptor-mediated responses and synaptic levels of NMDA receptors and alphaCaMKII. Furthermore, loss of presenilins causes reduced expression of CBP and CREB/CBP target genes, such as c-fos and BDNF. With increasing age, mutant mice develop striking neurodegeneration of the cerebral cortex and worsening impairments of memory and synaptic function. Neurodegeneration is accompanied by increased levels of the Cdk5 activator p25 and hyperphosphorylated tau. These results define essential roles and molecular targets of presenilins in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and neuronal survival in the adult cerebral cortex.",

        "Abstract": "The hippocampus is critical for formation of spatial memories. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons in freely behaving animals exhibit spatially selective firing patterns, which taken together form an internal representation of the environment. This representation is thought to contribute to the hippocampal spatial memory system. Behavioral long-term memories differ from short-term memories in requiring the synthesis of new proteins. Does the development of the internal hippocampal representation also require the synthesis of new proteins? We found that blocking protein synthesis in the brain of mice by 95% does not affect short-term stability of newly formed hippocampal place fields but abolishes stability in the long term. By contrast, inhibiting protein synthesis does not affect the retention and recall of previously established fields in a familiar environment, indicating that protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation is not required for recall. Our results indicate that place fields parallel both behavioral memories and the late phase of long-term potentiation in requiring the synthesis of new proteins for consolidation.",

        "Abstract": "To address the role of D1 receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex, we combined pharmacological and genetic manipulations to examine long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP)/long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in brain slices of rats and mice. We found that the D1 antagonist SCH23390 selectively blocked the maintenance but not the induction of LTP in the prefrontal cortex. Conversely, activation of D1 receptors facilitated the maintenance of LTP, and this effect is impaired in heterozygous D1 receptor knockout mice. Low-frequency stimulation induced a transient depression in the medial prefrontal cortex. This depression could be transformed into LTD by coapplication of dopamine. Coapplication of dopamine, however, shows no facilitating effect on LTD in heterozygous D1 receptor knockout mice. These results provide pharmacological and genetic evidence for a role of D1 receptors in the bidirectional modulation of synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex. The absence of this modulation in heterozygous knockout mice shows that a dysregulation of dopamine receptor expression levels can have dramatic effects on synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex.",

        "Title": "A form of long-lasting, learning-related synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus induced by heterosynaptic low-frequency pairing.",
        "Abstract": "The late, transcription- and translation-dependent phase of long-term synaptic potentiation (L-LTP) at the Schaffer collateral synapse of the hippocampus is an experimental model of the synaptic plasticity underlying long-lasting memory formation. L-LTP is typically induced by homosynaptic tetanic stimulation; but associative forms of learning are likely to require the heterosynaptic pairing of stimuli. Here we describe L-LTP elicited by such heterosynaptic pairing at the Schaffer collateral synapse in mice. We find that repeated stimulation of one pathway at low frequency (0.2 Hz), which does not by itself induce synaptic potentiation, will produce long-lasting synaptic plasticity when paired with a brief conditioning burst applied to an independent afferent pathway. The induction of heterosynaptic L-LTP is associative and critically depends on the precise time interval of pairing: simultaneous, conjunctional pairing induces L-LTP; in contrast, delayed pairing induces short-lasting early-phase LTP. Heterosynaptically induced early-phase LTP could be depotentiated by repeatedly presenting unpaired test stimuli, whereas L-LTP could not. This heterosynaptically induced L-LTP requires PKA and protein synthesis. In addition, heterosynaptically induced L-LTP is impaired in transgenic mice that express KCREB (a dominant negative inhibitor of adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate response element-binding protein-mediated transcription) in the hippocampus. These mice have previously been shown to be impaired in spatial memory but have normal L-LTP as induced by a conventional homosynaptic tetanic protocol. These data suggest that at least in some instances this L-LTP-inducing protocol may better model behaviorally relevant information storage and the in vivo mechanisms underlying long-lasting memories.",

        "Abstract": "Synapse-specific facilitation requires rapamycin-dependent local protein synthesis at the activated synapse. In Aplysia, rapamycin-dependent local protein synthesis serves two functions: (1) it provides a component of the mark at the activated synapse and thereby confers synapse specificity and (2) it stabilizes the synaptic growth associated with long-term facilitation. Here we report that a neuron-specific isoform of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) regulates this synaptic protein synthesis in an activity-dependent manner. Aplysia CPEB protein is upregulated locally at activated synapses, and it is needed not for the initiation but for the stable maintenance of long-term facilitation. We suggest that Aplysia CPEB is one of the stabilizing components of the synaptic mark.",

When yeast prion proteins switch state, they produce heritable phenotypes. We report prion-like properties in a neuronal member of the CPEB family (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein), which regulates mRNA translation. Compared to other CPEB family members, the neuronal protein has an N-terminal extension that shares characteristics of yeast prion-determinants: a high glutamine content and predicted conformational flexibility. When fused to a reporter protein in yeast, this region confers upon it the epigenetic changes in state that characterize yeast prions. Full-length CPEB undergoes similar changes, but surprisingly it is the dominant, self-perpetuating prion-like form that has the greatest capacity to stimulate translation of CPEB-regulated mRNA. We hypothesize that conversion of CPEB to a prion-like state in stimulated synapses helps to maintain long-term synaptic changes associated with memory storage.",

We find, using generalized and regional knockout mice, that deletion of the HCN1 channel causes profound motor learning and memory deficits in swimming and rotarod tasks. In cerebellar Purkinje cells, which are a key component of the cerebellar circuit for learning of correctly timed movements, HCN1 mediates an inward current that stabilizes the integrative properties of Purkinje cells and ensures that their input-output function is independent of the previous history of their activity. We suggest that this nonsynaptic integrative function of HCN1 is required for accurate decoding of input patterns and thereby enables synaptic plasticity to appropriately influence the performance of motor activity.",

Second, in certain instances the humanities and neural sciences use common methodologies to achieve their respective goals.",

        "Abstract": "Long-term synaptic plasticity requires both gene expression in the nucleus and local protein synthesis at synapses. The effector proteins that link molecular events in the cell body with local maintenance of synaptic strength are not known. We now show that treatment with serotonin (5-HT) that produces long-term facilitation induces the Aplysia eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1alpha (Ap-eEF1A) as a late gene that might serve this coupling function in sensory neurons. Although the translation factor is induced, it is not transported into axon processes when the stimulation with 5-HT was restricted to the cell body. In contrast, its mRNA is transported when 5-HT was applied to both cell body and synapses. Intracellular injection of antisense oligonucleotides or antibodies that block the induction and expression of Ap-eEF1A do not affect the initial expression of long-term facilitation but do block its maintenance beyond 24 h. The transport of eEF1A protein and its mRNA to nerve terminals suggests that the translation factor plays a role in the local protein synthesis that is essential for maintaining newly formed synapses.",

        "Abstract": "Local protein synthesis is required for long-lasting synapse-specific plasticity in cultured Aplysia sensorimotor synapses. To identify synaptically localized mRNAs, we prepared a cDNA library from isolated sensory neurites. By sequence analysis, we estimate that the library contains 263 distinct mRNAs, with 98 of these mRNAs constituting 70% of all clones. The localized transcripts are enriched for mRNAs encoding cytoskeletal elements and components of the translational machinery. In situ hybridization confirms that the mRNAs for at least eight of these transcripts are present in distal neurites. Immunocytochemistry reveals that serotonin regulates the translation of one of the localized mRNAs, that encoding alpha1-tubulin. Our identification of mRNAs encoding cytoskeletal elements suggests that local protein synthesis is required for the growth of new synaptic connections associated with persistent synaptic strengthening. Our finding of mRNAs encoding components of the translational machinery suggests that local protein synthesis serves to increase the translational capacity of synapses.",

        "Abstract": "The time course and functional significance of the structural changes associated with long-term facilitation of Aplysia sensory to motor neuron synaptic connections in culture were examined by time-lapse confocal imaging of individual sensory neuron varicosities labeled with three different fluorescent markers: the whole-cell marker Alexa-594 and two presynaptic marker proteins-synaptophysin-eGFP to monitor changes in synaptic vesicle distribution and synapto-PHluorin to monitor active transmitter release sites. Repeated pulses of serotonin induce two temporally, morphologically, and molecularly distinct presynaptic changes: (1) a rapid activation of silent presynaptic terminals by filling of preexisting empty varicosities with synaptic vesicles, which parallels intermediate-term facilitation, is completed within 3-6 hr and requires translation but not transcription and (2) a slower generation of new functional varicosities which occurs between 12-18 hr and requires transcription and translation. Enrichment of empty varicosities with synaptophysin accounts for 32% of the newly activated synapses at 24 hr, whereas newly formed varicosities account for 68%.",

        "Abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in several forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) at different hippocampal synapses. Using two-photon imaging of FM 1-43, a fluorescent marker of synaptic vesicle cycling, we find that BDNF is selectively required for those forms of LTP at Schaffer collateral synapses that recruit a presynaptic component of expression. BDNF-dependent forms of LTP also require activation of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. One form of LTP with presynaptic expression, theta burst LTP, is thought to be of particular behavioral importance. Using restricted genetic deletion to selectively disrupt BDNF production in either the entire forebrain (CA3 and CA1) or in only the postsynaptic CA1 neuron, we localize the source of BDNF required for LTP to presynaptic neurons. These results suggest that long-term synaptic plasticity has distinct presynaptic and postsynaptic modules. Release of BDNF from CA3 neurons is required to recruit the presynaptic, but not postsynaptic, module of plasticity.",

        "Abstract": "To examine the role of C/EBP-related transcription factors in long-term synaptic plasticity and memory storage, we have used the tetracycline-regulated system and expressed in the forebrain of mice a broad dominant-negative inhibitor of C/EBP (EGFP-AZIP), which preferentially interacts with several inhibiting isoforms of C/EBP. EGFP-AZIP also reduces the expression of ATF4, a distant member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors that is homologous to the Aplysia memory suppressor gene ApCREB-2. Consistent with the removal of inhibitory constraints on transcription, we find an increase in the pattern of gene transcripts in the hippocampus of EGFP-AZIP transgenic mice and both a reversibly enhanced hippocampal-based spatial memory and LTP. These results suggest that several proteins within the C/EBP family including ATF4 (CREB-2) act to constrain long-term synaptic changes and memory formation. Relief of this inhibition lowers the threshold for hippocampal-dependent long-term synaptic potentiation and memory storage in mice.",

        "Title": "p38 MAP kinase mediates both short-term and long-term synaptic depression in aplysia.",
        "Abstract": "At Aplysia sensory-to-motor neuron synapses, the inhibitory neuropeptide Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 (FMRFa) produces depression, and serotonin (5-HT) produces facilitation. Short-term depression has been found to result from the activation of a phospholipase A2. The released arachidonate is metabolized by 12-lipoxygenase to active second messengers. We find that FMRFa leads to the phosphorylation and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Short-term depression and the release of arachidonate are blocked by the specific p38 kinase inhibitor SB 203580. Both the inhibitor and an affinity-purified antibody raised against recombinant Aplysia p38 kinase injected into sensory neurons prevented long-term depression, which depends on the phosphorylation of translation factors cAMP response element-binding protein 2 (CREB2) and activating transcription factor 2. Facilitation produced by 5-HT, on the other hand, inactivates p38 kinase. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that p38 kinase activates CREB2. p38 kinase also is pivotal in the bidirectional regulation of synaptic plasticity: when the kinase is inhibited, brief treatment with 5-HT that normally produces only short-term facilitation now results in long-term facilitation. Conversely, in sensory neurons injected with the activated kinase, long-term facilitation is blocked, and brief exposure to FMRFa, which normally results in short-term depression, results in long-term depression. We conclude that p38 kinase, which itself is bidirectionally regulated by FMRFa and 5-HT, acts as a modulator of synaptic plasticity by positively regulating depression and serving as an inhibitory constraint for facilitation.",

        "Abstract": "Learning-induced synaptic plasticity commonly involves the interaction between cAMP and p42/44MAPK. To investigate the role of Rap1 as a potential signaling molecule coupling cAMP and p42/44MAPK, we expressed an interfering Rap1 mutant (iRap1) in the mouse forebrain. This expression selectively decreased basal phosphorylation of a membrane-associated pool of p42/44MAPK, impaired cAMP-dependent LTP in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway induced by either forskolin or theta frequency stimulation, decreased complex spike firing, and reduced the p42/44MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of the A-type potassium channel Kv4.2. These changes correlated with impaired spatial memory and context discrimination. These results indicate that Rap1 couples cAMP signaling to a selective membrane-associated pool of p42/44MAPK to control excitability of pyramidal cells, the early and late phases of LTP, and the storage of spatial memory.",

        "Abstract": "Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding (CPEB) proteins control polyadenylation-induced translation in early development. Studies in oocytes led to the delineation of Xenopus CPEB, the first member of the family to be identified, and its mouse homologue mCPEB-1. Recently, a second mouse family member, mCPEB-2, has been described in germ cells. Increasing evidence also implicates CPEB proteins as being important in the hippocampus, where these proteins are thought to regulate local protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity. We therefore carried out a systematic screen for CPEB genes in the mouse brain and report two previously undescribed gene family members: mCPEB-3 and -4. We next examined the expression of all four genes in the hippocampus and found that mCPEB-1, -2, and -4 transcripts are expressed in the principal cell layer in the CA3 and CA1 region and in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. mCPEB-3 was barely expressed in na\u00efve animals but together with mCPEB-4 was strongly up-regulated after injection of kainate to initiate seizure activity. Whereas mCPEB-1 is regulated by the Aurora kinase, mCPEB-2, -3, and -4 do not contain Aurora kinase phosphorylation sites. However, alternative splice isoforms of mCPEB-2, -3, and -4 encode the so-called B region with phosphorylation sites for cAMP-dependent protein kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and S6 kinase. Only isoforms that encode the B region were expressed in the principal cell layer. Coexpression of mCPEB-1 and the B region-containing splice isoforms suggests that a variety of different signaling pathways can recruit CPEB activity in hippocampal neurons.",

Long-lasting plasticity has been most extensively studied in the marine snail Aplysia and in the mammalian hippocampus, where Bliss and L\u00f8mo first described long-term potentiation 30 years ago. The molecular mechanisms of plasticity in these two systems have proven to have many similarities. Here, we briefly describe some of these areas of overlap. We then summarize recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of long-lasting synaptic facilitation in Aplysia and suggest that these may prove fruitful areas for future investigation in the mammalian hippocampus and at other synapses in the mammalian brain.",

        "Abstract": "The pathology of trisomy 21/Down syndrome includes cognitive and memory deficits. Increased expression of the dual-specificity protein kinase DYRK1A kinase (DYRK1A) appears to play a significant role in the neuropathology of Down syndrome. To shed light on the cellular role of DYRK1A and related genes we identified three DYRK/minibrain-like genes in the genome sequence of Caenorhabditis elegans, termed mbk-1, mbk-2, and hpk-1. We found these genes to be widely expressed and to localize to distinct subcellular compartments. We isolated deletion alleles in all three genes and show that loss of mbk-1, the gene most closely related to DYRK1A, causes no obvious defects, while another gene, mbk-2, is essential for viability. The overexpression of DYRK1A in Down syndrome led us to examine the effects of overexpression of its C. elegans ortholog mbk-1. We found that animals containing additional copies of the mbk-1 gene display behavioral defects in chemotaxis toward volatile chemoattractants and that the extent of these defects correlates with mbk-1 gene dosage. Using tissue-specific and inducible promoters, we show that additional copies of mbk-1 can impair olfaction cell-autonomously in mature, fully differentiated neurons and that this impairment is reversible. Our results suggest that increased gene dosage of human DYRK1A in trisomy 21 may disrupt the function of fully differentiated neurons and that this disruption is reversible.",

        "Abstract": "The treatment of memory disorders, such as the gradual weakening of memory with age, the ravages of Alzheimer's disease and the cognitive deficits in various forms of mental retardation, may greatly benefit from a better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of memory formation. There is increasing interest in the possibility of pharmacologically enhancing learning and memory even in the absence of specific anatomically evident pathology. Substantial evidence in experimental systems ranging from molluscs to humans indicates that the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a core component of the molecular switch that converts short- to long-term memory. Recent studies have greatly strengthened and refined our understanding of the role of CREB in learning and memory in mammals, in addition to providing greater insight into the molecular mechanisms of CREB regulation and function. This involvement of CREB and the upstream signalling pathways leading to its activation in learning-associated plasticity makes them attractive targets for drugs aimed at improving memory function, in both diseased and healthy individuals. However, CREB and its close relatives cAMP response element modulator and activating transcription factor-1 are ubiquitous proteins with several critical functions. This creates hurdles that the authors believe may limit the usefulness of CREB per se as a target for the development of memory-enhancing drugs, and focus on components of the upstream signalling pathways or on specific downstream targets will be required.",

However, it is unclear whether these memory-related transcription factors actually interact in the native environment in neurons. To clarify this question, we have developed an Aplysia two-hybrid system and found, consistent with previous studies that ApCREB2 interacts with ApCREB1a and ApC/EBP, and that ApC/EBP forms homodimers. We have also found that ApCREB1a and ApC/EBP do not interact. Therefore, our study shows that formerly described interactions between the proteins actually occur in the Aplysia neurons and that interactions between these transcription factors are specific.",

Moreover, we found that GRP receptor (GRPR) is expressed in GABAergic interneurons of the lateral nucleus. GRP excites these interneurons and increases their inhibition of principal neurons. GRPR-deficient mice showed decreased inhibition of principal neurons by the interneurons, enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP), and greater and more persistent long-term fear memory. By contrast, these mice performed normally in hippocampus-dependent Morris maze. These experiments provide genetic evidence that GRP and its neural circuitry operate as a negative feedback regulating fear and establish a causal relationship between Grpr gene expression, LTP, and amygdala-dependent memory for fear.",

We have now tested the roles in that plasticity of two associative cellular mechanisms: activity-dependent enhancement of presynaptic facilitation and postsynaptically induced long-term potentiation. By perturbing molecular signaling pathways in individual neurons, we have provided the most direct evidence to date that each of these mechanisms contributes to behavioral learning. In addition, our results suggest that the two mechanisms are not independent but rather interact through retrograde signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Excitatory and inhibitory inputs converge on single neurons and are integrated into a coherent output. Although much is known about short-term integration, little is known about how neurons sum opposing signals for long-term synaptic plasticity and memory storage. In Aplysia, we find that when a sensory neuron simultaneously receives inputs from the facilitatory transmitter 5-HT at one set of synapses and the inhibitory transmitter FMRFamide at another, long-term facilitation is blocked and synapse-specific long-term depression dominates. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that 5-HT induces the downstream gene C/EBP by activating CREB1, which recruits CBP for histone acetylation, whereas FMRFa leads to CREB1 displacement by CREB2 and recruitment of HDAC5 to deacetylate histones. When the two transmitters are applied together, facilitation is blocked because CREB2 and HDAC5 displace CREB1-CBP, thereby deacetylating histones.",

We have interfered with CREB family transcription factors in region CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus. This impairs learning in the Morris water maze, which specifically requires the dorsal hippocampus, but not context conditioning, which does not. The deficit is specific to long-term memory, as shown in an object recognition task. Several forms of late-phase LTP are normal, but forskolin-induced and dopamine-regulated potentiation are disrupted. These experiments represent the first targeting of the dorsal hippocampus in genetically modified mice and confirm a role for CREB in hippocampus-dependent learning. Nevertheless, they suggest that some experimental forms of plasticity bypass the requirement for CREB.",

        "Title": "Fear conditioning occludes LTP-induced presynaptic enhancement of synaptic transmission in the cortical pathway to the lateral amygdala.",
        "Abstract": "Auditory information critical for fear conditioning, a model of emotional learning, is conveyed to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala via two routes: directly from the medial geniculate nucleus and indirectly from the auditory cortex. Here we show in the cortico-amygdala pathway that learned fear occludes electrically induced long-term potentiation (LTP). Quantal analysis of the expression of LTP in this pathway reveals a significant presynaptic component reflected in an increase in probability of transmitter release. Conditioned fear also is accompanied by the enhancement in transmitter release at this cortico-amygdala synapse. These results indicate that the synaptic projections from the auditory cortex to the lateral amygdala are modified during the acquisition and expression of fear to auditory stimulation, thus further strengthening the proposed link between LTP in the auditory pathways to the amygdala and learned fear.",

        "Abstract": "Restricted and regulated expression in mice of VP16-CREB, a constitutively active form of CREB, in hippocampal CA1 neurons lowers the threshold for eliciting a persistent late phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway. This L-LTP has unusual properties in that its induction is not dependent on transcription. Pharmacological and two-pathway experiments suggest a model in which VP16-CREB activates the transcription of CRE-driven genes and leads to a cell-wide distribution of proteins that prime the synapses for subsequent synapse-specific capture of L-LTP by a weak stimulus. Our analysis indicates that synaptic capture of CRE-driven gene products may be sufficient for consolidation of LTP and provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of synaptic tagging and synapse-specific potentiation.",

        "Title": "Novel mechanism for gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuronal migration involving Gas6/Ark signaling to p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.",
        "Abstract": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the central regulator of the reproductive axis. Normal sexual maturation depends on the migration of GnRH neurons from the olfactory placode to the hypothalamus during development. Previously, we showed restricted expression of the membrane receptor adhesion-related kinase (Ark) in immortalized cell lines derived from migratory but not postmigratory GnRH neurons. In addition, Ark and GnRH transcripts were detected along the GnRH neuron migratory route in the E13 mouse cribriform plate. In the present study, we examined the role of Ark and its ligand, Gas6 (encoded by growth arrest-specific gene 6), in GnRH neuron migration. Gas6 stimulated lamellipodial extension, membrane ruffling, and chemotaxis of immortalized NLT GnRH neuronal cells via the Ark receptor. Gas6/Ark signaling promoted activation of the Rho family GTPase Rac, and adenoviral-mediated expression of dominant negative N17Rac abolished Gas6/Ark-induced actin cytoskeletal reorganization and migration of GnRH neuronal cells. In addition, p38 MAPK was activated downstream of Ark and Rac, and inhibition of p38 MAPK with either SB203580 or adenoviral dominant negative p38alpha also blocked Gas6/Ark-mediated migration. Finally, downstream of Rac and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Gas6/Ark signaling promoted activation of MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 and induced phosphorylation of HSP25, a known regulator of cortical actin remodeling. The data are the first to demonstrate a migratory signaling pathway downstream of Ark/Axl family receptors and suggest a previously unidentified role for p38 MAPK in neuronal migration. Furthermore, these studies support a potential role for Ark in the regulation of GnRH neuronal migration.",
