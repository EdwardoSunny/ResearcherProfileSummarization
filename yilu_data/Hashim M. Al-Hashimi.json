        "Abstract": "Knowing the conformational ensembles formed by mismatches is crucial for understanding how they are generated and repaired and how they contribute to genomic instability. Here, we review structural and energetic studies of the A-C mismatch in duplex DNA and use the information to identify critical conformational states in its ensemble and their significance in genetic processes. In the 1970s, Topal and Fresco proposed the A-C wobble stabilized by two hydrogen bonds, one requiring protonation of adenine-N1. Subsequent NMR and X-ray crystallography studies showed that the protonated A-C wobble was in dynamic equilibrium with a neutral inverted wobble. The mismatch was shown to destabilize duplex DNA in a sequence- and pH-dependent manner by 2.4-3.8\u00a0kcal/mol and to have an apparent pKa ranging between 7.2 and 7.7. The A-C mismatch conformational repertoire expanded as structures were determined for damaged and protein-bound DNA. These structures included Watson-Crick-like conformations forming through tautomerization of the bases that drive replication errors, the reverse wobble forming through rotation of the entire nucleotide proposed to increase the fidelity of DNA replication, and the Hoogsteen base-pair forming through the flipping of the adenine base which explained the unusual specificity of DNA polymerases that bypass DNA damage. Thus, the A-C mismatch ensemble encompasses various conformational states that can be selectively stabilized in response to environmental changes such as pH shifts, intermolecular interactions, and chemical modifications, and these adaptations facilitate critical biological processes. This review also highlights the utility of existing 3D structures to build ensemble models for nucleic acid motifs.",

        "Title": "NMR measurements of transient low-populated tautomeric and anionic Watson-Crick-like G\u00b7T/U in RNA:DNA hybrids: implications for the fidelity of transcription and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing.",
        "Abstract": "Many biochemical processes use the Watson-Crick geometry to distinguish correct from incorrect base pairing. However, on rare occasions, mismatches such as G\u00b7T/U can transiently adopt Watson-Crick-like conformations through tautomerization or ionization of the bases, giving rise to replicative and translational errors. The propensities to form Watson-Crick-like mismatches in RNA:DNA hybrids remain unknown, making it unclear whether they can also contribute to errors during processes such as transcription and CRISPR/Cas editing. Here, using NMR R1\u03c1 experiments, we show that dG\u00b7rU and dT\u00b7rG mismatches in two RNA:DNA hybrids transiently form tautomeric (Genol\u00b7T/U $ \\mathbin{\\lower.3ex\\hbox{$\\buildrel\\textstyle\\rightarrow\\over {\\smash{\\leftarrow}\\vphantom{_{\\vbox to.5ex{\\vss}}}}$}}$ G\u00b7Tenol/Uenol) and anionic (G\u00b7T-/U-) Watson-Crick-like conformations. The tautomerization dynamics were like those measured in A-RNA and B-DNA duplexes. However, anionic dG\u00b7rU- formed with a ten-fold higher propensity relative to dT-\u00b7rG and dG\u00b7dT- and this could be attributed to the lower pKa (\u0394pKa \u223c0.4-0.9) of U versus T. Our findings suggest plausible roles for Watson-Crick-like G\u00b7T/U mismatches in transcriptional errors and CRISPR/Cas9 off-target gene editing, uncover a crucial difference between the chemical dynamics of G\u00b7U versus G\u00b7T, and indicate that anionic Watson-Crick-like G\u00b7U- could play a significant role evading Watson-Crick fidelity checkpoints in RNA:DNA hybrids and RNA duplexes.",

        "Abstract": "Sparse and short-lived excited RNA conformational states are essential players in cell physiology, disease, and therapeutic development, yet determining their 3D structures remains challenging. Combining mutagenesis, NMR spectroscopy, and computational modeling, we determined the 3D structural ensemble formed by a short-lived (lifetime ~2.1\u2009ms) lowly-populated (~0.4%) conformational state in HIV-1 TAR RNA. Through a strand register shift, the excited conformational state completely remodels the 3D structure of the ground state (RMSD from the ground state = 7.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9\u2009\u00c5), forming a surprisingly more ordered conformational ensemble rich in non-canonical mismatches. The structure impedes the formation of the motifs recognized by Tat and the super elongation complex, explaining why this alternative TAR conformation cannot activate HIV-1 transcription. The ability to determine the 3D structures of fleeting RNA states using the presented methodology holds great promise for our understanding of RNA biology, disease mechanisms, and the development of RNA-targeting therapeutics.",

        "Title": "Hydrogen bonding in duplex DNA probed by DNP enhanced solid-state NMR N-H bond length measurements.",
        "Abstract": "Numerous biological processes and mechanisms depend on details of base pairing and hydrogen bonding in DNA. Hydrogen bonds are challenging to quantify by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM due to difficulty of visualizing hydrogen atom locations but can be probed with site specificity by NMR spectroscopy in solution and the solid state with the latter particularly suited to large, slowly tumbling DNA complexes. Recently, we showed that low-temperature dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced solid-state NMR is a valuable tool for distinguishing Hoogsteen base pairs (bps) from canonical Watson-Crick bps in various DNA systems under native-like conditions. Here, using a model 12-mer DNA duplex containing two central adenine-thymine (A-T) bps in either Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen confirmation, we demonstrate DNP solid-state NMR measurements of thymine N3-H3 bond lengths, which are sensitive to details of N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bonding and permit hydrogen bonds for the two bp conformers to be systematically compared within the same DNA sequence context. For this DNA duplex, effectively identical TN3-H3 bond lengths of 1.055 \u00b1 0.011\u00a0\u00c5 and 1.060 \u00b1 0.011\u00a0\u00c5 were found for Watson-Crick A-T and Hoogsteen A (syn)-T base pairs, respectively, relative to a reference amide bond length of 1.015 \u00b1 0.010\u00a0\u00c5 determined for N-acetyl-valine under comparable experimental conditions. Considering that prior quantum chemical calculations which account for zero-point motions predict a somewhat longer effective peptide N-H bond length of 1.041\u00a0\u00c5, in agreement with solution and solid-state NMR studies of peptides and proteins at ambient temperature, to facilitate direct comparisons with these earlier studies TN3-H3 bond lengths for the DNA samples can be readily scaled appropriately to yield 1.083\u00a0\u00c5 and 1.087\u00a0\u00c5 for Watson-Crick A-T and Hoogsteen A (syn)-T bps, respectively, relative to the 1.041\u00a0\u00c5 reference peptide N-H bond length. Remarkably, in the context of the model DNA duplex, these results indicate that there are no significant differences in N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N A-T hydrogen bonds between Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen bp conformers. More generally, high precision measurements of N-H bond lengths by low-temperature DNP solid-state NMR based methods are expected to facilitate detailed comparative analysis of hydrogen bonding for a range of DNA complexes and base pairing environments.",

        "Title": "Kinetic Resolution of the Atomic 3D Structures Formed by Ground and Excited Conformational States in an RNA Dynamic Ensemble.",
        "Abstract": "Knowing the 3D structures formed by the various conformations populating the RNA free-energy landscape, their relative abundance, and kinetic interconversion rates is required to obtain a quantitative and predictive understanding of how RNAs fold and function at the atomic level. While methods integrating ensemble-averaged experimental data with computational modeling are helping define the most abundant conformations in RNA ensembles, elucidating their kinetic rates of interconversion and determining the 3D structures of sparsely populated short-lived RNA excited conformational states (ESs) remains challenging. Here, we developed an approach integrating Rosetta-FARFAR RNA structure prediction with NMR residual dipolar couplings and relaxation dispersion that simultaneously determines the 3D structures formed by the ground-state (GS) and ES subensembles, their relative abundance, and kinetic rates of interconversion. The approach is demonstrated on HIV-1 TAR, whose six-nucleotide apical loop was previously shown to form a sparsely populated (\u223c13%) short-lived (lifetime \u223c 45 \u03bcs) ES. In the GS, the apical loop forms a broad distribution of open conformations interconverting on the pico-to-nanosecond time scale. Most residues are unpaired and preorganized to bind the Tat-superelongation protein complex. The apical loop zips up in the ES, forming a narrow distribution of closed conformations, which sequester critical residues required for protein recognition. Our work introduces an approach for determining the 3D ensemble models formed by sparsely populated RNA conformational states, provides a rare atomic view of an RNA ES, and kinetically resolves the atomic 3D structures of RNA conformational substates, interchanging on time scales spanning 6 orders of magnitude, from picoseconds to microseconds.",

        "Abstract": "In the mid-1930s, the English mathematician and logician Alan Turing invented an imaginary machine which could emulate the process of manipulating finite symbolic configurations by human computers. His machine launched the field of computer science and provided a foundation for the modern-day programmable computer. A decade later, building on Turing's machine, the American-Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann invented an imaginary self-reproducing machine capable of open-ended evolution. Through his machine, von Neumann answered one of the deepest questions in Biology: Why is it that all living organisms carry a self-description in the form of DNA? The story behind how two pioneers of computer science stumbled on the secret of life many years before the discovery of the DNA double helix is not well known, not even to biologists, and you will not find it in biology textbooks. Yet, the story is just as relevant today as it was eighty years ago: Turing and von Neumann left a blueprint for studying biological systems as if they were computing machines. This approach may hold the key to answering many remaining questions in Biology and could even lead to advances in computer science.",

        "Abstract": "The cytoplasm is compartmentalized into different translation environments. mRNAs use their 3'UTRs to localize to distinct cytoplasmic compartments, including TIS granules (TGs). Many transcription factors, including MYC, are translated in TGs. It was shown that translation of proteins in TGs enables the formation of protein complexes that cannot be established when these proteins are translated in the cytosol, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here we show that MYC protein complexes that involve binding to the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of MYC are only formed when MYC is translated in TGs. TG-dependent protein complexes require TG-enriched mRNAs for assembly. These mRNAs bind to a new and widespread RNA-binding domain in neutral or negatively charged IDRs in several transcription factors, including MYC. RNA-IDR interaction changes the conformational ensemble of the IDR, enabling the formation of MYC protein complexes that act in the nucleus and control functions that cannot be accomplished by cytosolically-translated MYC. We propose that certain mRNAs have IDR chaperone activity as they control IDR conformations. In addition to post-translational modifications, we found a novel mode of protein activity regulation. Since RNA-IDR interactions are prevalent, we suggest that mRNA-dependent control of protein functional states is widespread.",

        "Abstract": "The majority of base pairs in double-stranded DNA exist in the canonical Watson-Crick geometry. However, they can also adopt alternate Hoogsteen conformations in various complexes of DNA with proteins and small molecules, which are key for biological function and mechanism. While detection of Hoogsteen base pairs in large DNA complexes and assemblies poses considerable challenges for traditional structural biology techniques, we show here that multidimensional dynamic nuclear polarization-enhanced solid-state NMR can serve as a unique spectroscopic tool for observing and distinguishing Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen base pairs in a broad range of DNA systems based on characteristic NMR chemical shifts and internuclear dipolar couplings. We illustrate this approach using a model 12-mer DNA duplex, free and in complex with the antibiotic echinomycin, which features two central adenine-thymine base pairs with Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen geometry, respectively, and subsequently extend it to the \u223c200 kDa Widom 601 DNA nucleosome core particle.",

        "Abstract": "Thermodynamic preferences to form non-native conformations are crucial for understanding how nucleic acids fold and function. However, they are difficult to measure experimentally because this requires accurately determining the population of minor low-abundance (<10%) conformations in a sea of other conformations. Here, we show that melting experiments enable facile measurements of thermodynamic preferences to adopt nonnative conformations in DNA and RNA. The key to this \"delta-melt\" approach is to use chemical modifications to render specific minor non-native conformations the major state. The validity and robustness of delta-melt is established for four different non-native conformations under various physiological conditions and sequence contexts through independent measurements of thermodynamic preferences using NMR. Delta-melt is faster relative to NMR, simple, and cost-effective and enables thermodynamic preferences to be measured for exceptionally low-populated conformations. Using delta-melt, we obtained rare insights into conformational cooperativity, obtaining evidence for significant cooperativity (1.0 to 2.5 kcal/mol) when simultaneously forming two adjacent Hoogsteen base pairs. We also measured the thermodynamic preferences to form G-C",

However, A-T and G-C can also form alternative 'Hoogsteen' bps, expanding the functional complexity of DNA. We developed 'Hoog-finder', which uses structural fingerprints to rapidly screen Hoogsteen bps, which may have been mismodeled as Watson-Crick in crystal structures of protein-DNA complexes. We uncovered 17\u00a0Hoogsteen bps, 7\u00a0of which were in complex with 6\u00a0proteins never before shown to bind Hoogsteen bps. The Hoogsteen bps occur near mismatches, nicks\u00a0and lesions and some appear to participate in recognition and damage repair. Our results suggest a potentially broad role for Hoogsteen bps in stressed regions of the genome and call for a community-wide effort to identify these bps in current and future crystal structures of DNA and its complexes.",

We review recent advances in solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods and their integration with computational techniques that are improving the ability to probe the dynamic ensembles of DNA and RNA. These include computational approaches for predicting chemical shifts from structure and generating conformational libraries from sequence, measurements of exact nuclear Overhauser effects, development of new probes to study chemical exchange using relaxation dispersion, faster and more sensitive real-time NMR techniques, and new NMR approaches to tackle large nucleic acid assemblies. We discuss how these advances are leading to new mechanistic insights into gene expression and regulation.",

        "Abstract": "Biomolecules form dynamic ensembles of many inter-converting conformations which are key for understanding how they fold and function. However, determining ensembles is challenging because the information required to specify atomic structures for thousands of conformations far exceeds that of experimental measurements. We addressed this data gap and dramatically simplified and accelerated RNA ensemble determination by using structure prediction tools that leverage the growing database of RNA structures to generate a conformation library. Refinement of this library with NMR residual dipolar couplings provided an atomistic ensemble model for HIV-1 TAR, and the model accuracy was independently supported by comparisons to quantum-mechanical calculations of NMR chemical shifts, comparison to a crystal structure of a substate, and through designed ensemble redistribution via atomic mutagenesis. Applications to TAR bulge variants and more complex tertiary RNAs support the generality of this approach and the potential to make the determination of atomic-resolution RNA ensembles routine.",

        "Abstract": "2'-O-Methyl (Nm) is a highly abundant post-transcriptional RNA modification that plays important biological roles through mechanisms that are not entirely understood. There is evidence that Nm can alter the biological activities of RNAs by biasing the ribose sugar pucker equilibrium toward the C3'-endo conformation formed in canonical duplexes. However, little is known about how Nm might more broadly alter the dynamic ensembles of flexible RNAs containing bulges and internal loops. Here, using NMR and the HIV-1 transactivation response (TAR) element as a model system, we show that Nm preferentially stabilizes alternative secondary structures in which the Nm-modified nucleotides are paired, increasing both the abundance and lifetime of low-populated short-lived excited states by up to 10-fold. The extent of stabilization increased with number of Nm modifications and was also dependent on Mg2+. Through phi-value analysis, the Nm modification also provided rare insights into the structure of the transition state for conformational exchange. Our results suggest that Nm could alter the biological activities of Nm-modified RNAs by modulating their secondary structural ensembles as well as establish the utility of Nm as a tool for the discovery and characterization of RNA excited state conformations.",

        "Abstract": "Identifying small molecules that selectively bind an RNA target while discriminating against all other cellular RNAs is an important challenge in RNA-targeted drug discovery. Much effort has been directed toward identifying drug-like small molecules that minimize electrostatic and stacking interactions that lead to nonspecific binding of aminoglycosides and intercalators to many stem-loop RNAs. Many such compounds have been reported to bind RNAs and inhibit their cellular activities. However, target engagement and cellular selectivity assays are not routinely performed, and it is often unclear whether functional activity directly results from specific binding to the target RNA. Here, we examined the propensities of three drug-like compounds, previously shown to bind and inhibit the cellular activities of distinct stem-loop RNAs, to bind and inhibit the cellular activities of two unrelated HIV-1 stem-loop RNAs: the transactivation response element (TAR) and the rev response element stem IIB (RREIIB). All compounds bound TAR and RREIIB in vitro, and two inhibited TAR-dependent transactivation and RRE-dependent viral export in cell-based assays while also exhibiting off-target interactions consistent with nonspecific activity. A survey of X-ray and NMR structures of RNA-small molecule complexes revealed that aminoglycosides and drug-like molecules form hydrogen bonds with functional groups commonly accessible in canonical stem-loop RNA motifs, in contrast to ligands that specifically bind riboswitches. Our results demonstrate that drug-like molecules can nonspecifically bind stem-loop RNAs most likely through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions and reinforce the importance of assaying for off-target interactions and RNA selectivity in vitro and in cells when assessing novel RNA-binders.",

        "Abstract": "DNA bases can adopt energetically unfavorable tautomeric forms that enable the formation of Watson-Crick-like (WC-like) mispairs, which have been proposed to give rise to spontaneous mutations in DNA and misincorporation errors in DNA replication and translation. Previous NMR and computational studies have indicated that the population of WC-like guanine-thymine (G-T) mispairs depends on the environment, such as the local nucleic acid sequence and solvation. To investigate these environmental effects, herein G-T mispair tautomerization processes are studied computationally in aqueous solution, in A-form and B-form DNA duplexes, and within the active site of a DNA polymerase \u03bb variant. The wobble G-T (wG-T), WC-like G-T*, and WC-like G*-T forms are considered, where * indicates the enol tautomer of the base. The minimum free energy paths for the tautomerization from the wG-T to the WC-like G-T* and from the WC-like G-T* to the WC-like G*-T are computed with mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) free energy simulations. The reaction free energies and free energy barriers are found to be significantly influenced by the environment. The wG-T\u2192G-T* tautomerization is predicted to be endoergic in aqueous solution and the DNA duplexes but slightly exoergic in the polymerase, with Arg517 and Asn513 providing electrostatic stabilization of G-T*. The G-T*\u2192G*-T tautomerization is also predicted to be slightly more thermodynamically favorable in the polymerase relative to these DNA duplexes. These simulations are consistent with an experimentally driven kinetic misincorporation model suggesting that G-T mispair tautomerization occurs in the ajar polymerase conformation or concertedly with the transition from the ajar to the closed polymerase conformation. Furthermore, the order of the associated two proton transfer reactions is predicted to be different in the polymerase than in aqueous solution and the DNA duplexes. These studies highlight the impact of the environment on the thermodynamics, kinetics, and fundamental mechanisms of G-T mispair tautomerization, which plays a role in a wide range of biochemically important processes.",

        "Abstract": "Low-abundance short-lived non-native conformations referred to as excited states (ESs) are increasingly observed in\u00a0vitro and implicated in the folding and biological activities of regulatory RNAs. We developed an approach for assessing the relative abundance of RNA ESs within the functional cellular context. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to estimate the degree to which substitution mutations bias conformational equilibria toward the inactive ES in\u00a0vitro. The cellular activity of the ES-stabilizing mutants was used as an indirect measure of the conformational equilibria within the functional cellular context. Compensatory mutations that restore the ground-state conformation were used to control for changes in sequence. Using this approach, we show that the ESs of two regulatory RNAs from HIV-1, the transactivation response element (TAR) and the Rev response element (RRE), likely form in cells with abundances comparable to those measured in\u00a0vitro, and their targeted stabilization may provide an avenue for developing anti-HIV therapeutics.",

        "Title": "Demonstration that Small Molecules can Bind and Stabilize Low-abundance Short-lived RNA Excited Conformational States.",
        "Abstract": "Many promising RNA drug targets have functions that require the formation of RNA-protein complexes, but inhibiting RNA-protein interactions can prove difficult using small molecules. Regulatory RNAs have been shown to transiently form excited conformational states (ESs) that remodel local aspects of secondary structure. In some cases, the ES conformation has been shown to be inactive and to be poorly recognized by protein binding partners. In these cases, specifically targeting and stabilizing the RNA ES using a small molecule provides a rational structure-based strategy for inhibiting RNA activity. However, this requires that a small molecule discriminates between two conformations of the same RNA to preferentially bind and stabilize the short-lived low-abundance ES relative to the long-lived more abundant ground state (GS). Here, we tested the feasibility of this approach by designing a mutant that inverts the conformational equilibrium of the HIV-1 transactivation response element (TAR) RNA, such that the native GS conformation becomes a low-abundance ES. Using this mutant and NMR chemical shift mapping experiments, we show that argininamide, a ligand mimic of TAR's cognate protein binding partner Tat, is able to restore a native-like conformation by preferentially binding and stabilizing the transient and low-populated ES. A synthetic small molecule optimized to bind the TAR GS also partially stabilized the ES, whereas an aminoglycoside molecule that binds RNAs nonspecifically did not preferentially stabilize the ES to a similar extent. These results support the feasibility of inhibiting RNA activity using small molecules that preferentially bind and stabilize the ES.",

        "Abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a ubiquitous RNA post-transcriptional modification found in coding as well as non-coding RNAs. m6A has also been found in viral RNAs where it is proposed to modulate host-pathogen interactions. Two m6A sites have been reported in the HIV-1 Rev response element (RRE) stem IIB, one of which was shown to enhance binding to the viral protein Rev and viral RNA export. However, because these m6A sites have not been observed in other studies mapping m6A in HIV-1 RNA, their significance remains to be firmly established. Here, using optical melting experiments, NMR spectroscopy, and in vitro binding assays, we show that m6A minimally impacts the stability, structure, and dynamics of RRE stem IIB as well as its binding affinity to the Rev arginine-rich-motif (ARM) in vitro. Our results indicate that if present in stem IIB, m6A is unlikely to substantially alter the conformational properties of the RNA. Our results add to a growing view that the impact of m6A on RNA depends on sequence context and Mg2+.",

        "Abstract": "RNA recognition frequently results in conformational changes that optimize intermolecular binding. As a consequence, the overall binding affinity of RNA to its binding partners depends not only on the intermolecular interactions formed in the bound state but also on the energy cost associated with changing the RNA conformational distribution. Measuring these \"conformational penalties\" is, however, challenging because bound RNA conformations tend to have equilibrium populations in the absence of the binding partner that fall outside detection by conventional biophysical methods. In this study we employ as a model system HIV-1 TAR RNA and its interaction with the ligand argininamide (ARG), a mimic of TAR's cognate protein binding partner, the transactivator Tat. We use NMR chemical shift perturbations and relaxation dispersion in combination with Bayesian inference to develop a detailed thermodynamic model of coupled conformational change and ligand binding. Starting from a comprehensive 12-state model of the equilibrium, we estimate the energies of six distinct detectable thermodynamic states that are not accessible by currently available methods. Our approach identifies a minimum of four RNA intermediates that differ in terms of the TAR conformation and ARG occupancy. The dominant bound TAR conformation features two bound ARG ligands and has an equilibrium population in the absence of ARG that is below detection limit. Consequently, even though ARG binds to TAR with an apparent overall weak affinity (",

Hoogsteen base pairs form through concurrent rotation of the purine base about the glycosidic bond from an anti to a syn conformation and constriction of the C1'-C1' distance across the base pair by \u223c2\u202f\u00c5 to allow Hoogsteen type hydrogen bonding. Owing to their unique structure, Hoogsteen base pairs can play important roles in DNA recognition, the accommodation, recognition, and repair of DNA damage, and in DNA replication. NMR relaxation dispersion experiments targeting imino nitrogen and protonated base and sugar carbons have provided insights into many structural features of transient Hoogsteen base pairs, including one of two predicted hydrogen bonds involving (G)N7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H-N3(C)",

Hoogsteen bps have been reported in a handful of X-ray structures of protein-DNA complexes. However, there are several examples of Hoogsteen bps in crystal structures that form Watson-Crick bps when examined under solution conditions. Furthermore, Hoogsteen bps can sometimes be difficult to resolve in DNA:protein complexes by X-ray crystallography due to ambiguous electron density and by solution-state NMR spectroscopy due to size limitations. Here, using infrared spectroscopy, we report the first direct solution-state observation of a Hoogsteen (G-C",

        "Abstract": "The HIV-1 Rev response element (RRE) RNA element mediates the nuclear export of intron containing viral RNAs by forming an oligomeric complex with the viral protein Rev. Stem IIB and nearby stem II three-way junction nucleate oligomerization through cooperative binding of two Rev molecules. Conformational flexibility at this RRE region has been shown to be important for Rev binding. However, the nature of the flexibility has remained elusive. Here, using NMR relaxation dispersion, including a new strategy for directly observing transient conformational states in large RNAs, we find that stem IIB alone or when part of the larger RREII three-way junction robustly exists in dynamic equilibrium with non-native excited state (ES) conformations that have a combined population of \u223c20%. The ESs disrupt the Rev-binding site by changing local secondary structure, and their stabilization via point substitution mutations decreases the binding affinity to the Rev arginine-rich motif (ARM) by 15- to 80-fold. The ensemble clarifies the conformational flexibility observed in stem IIB, reveals long-range conformational coupling between stem IIB and the three-way junction that may play roles in cooperative Rev binding, and also identifies non-native RRE conformational states as new targets for the development of anti-HIV therapeutics.",

The functions of many regulatory RNAs depend on how their 3D structure changes in response to a diverse array of cellular conditions. In this Review, we examine how the structural characterization of RNA as dynamic ensembles of conformations, which form with different probabilities and at different timescales, is improving our understanding of RNA function in cells. We discuss the mechanisms of gene regulation by microRNAs, riboswitches, ribozymes, post-transcriptional RNA modifications and RNA-binding proteins, and how the cellular environment and processes such as liquid-liquid phase separation may affect RNA folding and activity. The emerging RNA-ensemble-function paradigm is changing our perspective and understanding of RNA regulation, from in vitro to in vivo and from descriptive to predictive.",

        "Abstract": "The N-methyltransferase TylM1 from Streptomyces fradiae catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of the deoxyamino sugar mycaminose, a substituent of the antibiotic tylosin. The high-resolution crystal structure of TylM1 bound to the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) illustrates a network of carbon-oxygen (CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O) hydrogen bonds between the substrate's sulfonium cation and residues within the active site. These interactions include hydrogen bonds between the methyl and methylene groups of the AdoMet sulfonium cation and the hydroxyl groups of Tyr14 and Ser120 in the enzyme. To examine the functions of these interactions, we generated Tyr14 to phenylalanine (Y14F) and Ser120 to alanine (S120A) mutations to selectively ablate the CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonding to AdoMet. The TylM1 S120A mutant exhibited a modest decrease in its catalytic efficiency relative to that of the wild type (WT) enzyme, whereas the Y14F mutation resulted in an approximately 30-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency. In contrast, site-specific substitution of Tyr14 by the noncanonical amino acid p-aminophenylalanine partially restored activity comparable to that of the WT enzyme. Correlatively, quantum mechanical calculations of the activation barrier energies of WT TylM1 and the Tyr14 mutants suggest that substitutions that abrogate hydrogen bonding with the AdoMet methyl group impair methyl transfer. Together, these results offer insights into roles of CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonding in modulating the catalytic efficiency of TylM1.",

        "Title": "The RRM of the kRNA-editing protein TbRGG2 uses multiple surfaces to bind and remodel RNA.",
        "Abstract": "Kinetoplastid RNA (kRNA) editing takes place in the mitochondria of kinetoplastid protists and creates translatable mRNAs by uridine insertion/deletion. Extensively edited (pan-edited) transcripts contain quadruplex forming guanine stretches, which must be remodeled to promote uridine insertion/deletion. Here we show that the RRM domain of the essential kRNA-editing factor TbRGG2 binds poly(G) and poly(U) RNA and can unfold both. A region C-terminal to the RRM mediates TbRGG2 dimerization, enhancing RNA binding. A RRM-U4 RNA structure reveals a unique RNA-binding mechanism in which the two RRMs of the dimer employ aromatic residues outside the canonical RRM RNA-binding motifs to encase and wrench open the RNA, while backbone atoms specify the uridine bases. Notably, poly(G) RNA is bound via a different binding surface. Thus, these data indicate that TbRGG2 RRM can bind and remodel several RNA substrates suggesting how it might play multiple roles in the kRNA editing process.",

        "Abstract": "A(syn)-U/T and G(syn)-C+ Hoogsteen (HG) base pairs (bps) are energetically more disfavored relative to Watson-Crick (WC) bps in A-RNA as compared to B-DNA by >1 kcal/mol for reasons that are not fully understood. Here, we used NMR spectroscopy, optical melting experiments, molecular dynamics simulations and modified nucleotides to identify factors that contribute to this destabilization of HG bps in A-RNA. Removing the 2'-hydroxyl at single purine nucleotides in A-RNA duplexes did not stabilize HG bps relative to WC. In contrast, loosening the A-form geometry using a bulge in A-RNA reduced the energy cost of forming HG bps at the flanking sites to B-DNA levels. A structural and thermodynamic analysis of purine-purine HG mismatches reveals that compared to B-DNA, the A-form geometry disfavors syn purines by 1.5-4 kcal/mol due to sugar-backbone rearrangements needed to sterically accommodate the syn base. Based on MD simulations, an additional penalty of 3-4 kcal/mol applies for purine-pyrimidine HG bps due to the higher energetic cost associated with moving the bases to form hydrogen bonds in A-RNA versus B-DNA. These results provide insights into a fundamental difference between A-RNA and B-DNA duplexes with important implications for how they respond to damage and post-transcriptional modifications.",

Here we subjected the transactivation response element (TAR) RNA from human immunodeficiency virus type-1 to experimental high-throughput screening against ~100,000 drug-like small molecules. Results were augmented with 170 known TAR-binding molecules and used to generate sublibraries optimized for evaluating enrichment when virtually screening a dynamic ensemble of TAR determined by combining NMR spectroscopy data and molecular dynamics simulations. Ensemble-based virtual screening scores molecules with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of ~0.85-0.94 and with ~40-75% of all hits falling within the top 2% of scored molecules. The enrichment decreased significantly for ensembles generated from the same molecular dynamics simulations without input NMR data and for other control ensembles. The results demonstrate that experimentally determined RNA ensembles can significantly enrich libraries with true hits and that the degree of enrichment is dependent on the accuracy of the ensemble.",

        "Abstract": "In naked duplex DNA, G-C and A-T Watson-Crick base pairs exist in dynamic equilibrium with their Hoogsteen counterparts. Here, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation dispersion and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine how Watson-Crick/Hoogsteen dynamics are modulated upon recognition of duplex DNA by the bisintercalator echinomycin and monointercalator actinomycin D. In both cases, DNA recognition results in the quenching of Hoogsteen dynamics at base pairs involved in intermolecular base-specific hydrogen bonds. In the case of echinomycin, the Hoogsteen population increased 10-fold for base pairs flanking the chromophore most likely due to intermolecular stacking interactions, whereas actinomycin D minimally affected Hoogsteen dynamics at other sites. Modulation of Hoogsteen dynamics at binding interfaces may be a general phenomenon with important implications for DNA-ligand and DNA-protein recognition.",

To understand how such rearrangements are orchestrated, we used high-throughput chemical footprinting to dissect a seemingly concerted rearrangement in P5abc RNA, a paradigm of RNA folding studies. With mutations that systematically disrupt or restore putative structural elements, we found that this transition reflects local folding of structural modules, with modest and incremental cooperativity that results in concerted behavior. First, two distant secondary structure changes are coupled through a bridging three-way junction and Mg",

        "Abstract": "HdeA is a periplasmic chaperone that is rapidly activated upon shifting the pH to acidic conditions. This activation is thought to involve monomerization of HdeA. There is evidence that monomerization and partial unfolding allow the chaperone to bind to proteins denatured by low pH, thereby protecting them from aggregation. We analyzed the acid-induced unfolding of HdeA using NMR spectroscopy and fluorescence measurements, and obtained experimental evidence suggesting a complex mechanism in HdeA's acid-induced unfolding pathway, as previously postulated from molecular dynamics simulations. Counterintuitively, dissociation constant measurements show a stabilization of the HdeA dimer upon exposure to mildly acidic conditions. We provide experimental evidence that protonation of Glu37, a glutamate residue embedded in a hydrophobic pocket of HdeA, is important in controlling HdeA stabilization and thus the acid activation of this chaperone. Our data also reveal a sharp transition from folded dimer to unfolded monomer between pH3 and pH 2, and suggest the existence of a low-populated, partially folded intermediate that could assist in chaperone activation or function. Overall, this study provides a detailed experimental investigation into the mechanism by which HdeA unfolds and activates.",

        "Title": "Resolving sugar puckers in RNA excited states exposes slow modes of repuckering dynamics.",
        "Abstract": "Recent studies have shown that RNAs exist in dynamic equilibrium with short-lived low-abundance 'excited states' that form by reshuffling base pairs in and around non-canonical motifs. These conformational states are proposed to be rich in non-canonical motifs and to play roles in the folding and regulatory functions of non-coding RNAs but their structure proves difficult to characterize given their transient nature. Here, we describe an approach for determining sugar pucker conformation in RNA excited states through nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of C1\u0384 and C4\u0384 rotating frame spin relaxation (R1\u03c1) in uniformly 13C/15N labeled RNA samples. Application to HIV-1 TAR exposed slow modes of sugar repuckering dynamics at the \u03bcs and ms timescale accompanying transitions between non-helical (C2\u0384-endo) to helical (C3\u0384-endo) conformations during formation of two distinct excited states. In contrast, we did not obtain any evidence for slow sugar repuckering dynamics for nucleotides in a variety of structural contexts that do not undergo non-helical to helical transitions. Our results outline a route for significantly improving the conformational characterization of RNA excited states and suggest that slow modes of repuckering dynamics gated by transient changes in secondary structure are quite common in RNA.",

        "Abstract": "In the canonical DNA double helix, Watson-Crick (WC) base pairs (bps) exist in dynamic equilibrium with sparsely populated (\u223c0.02-0.4%) and short-lived (lifetimes \u223c0.2-2.5 ms) Hoogsteen (HG) bps. To gain insights into transient HG bps, we used solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, including measurements of residual dipolar couplings and molecular dynamics simulations, to examine how a single HG bp trapped using the N1-methylated adenine (m1A) lesion affects the structural and dynamic properties of two duplexes. The solution structure and dynamic ensembles of the duplexes reveals that in both cases, m1A forms a m1A\u2022T HG bp, which is accompanied by local and global structural and dynamic perturbations in the double helix. These include a bias toward the BI backbone conformation; sugar repuckering, major-groove directed kinking (\u223c9\u00b0); and local melting of neighboring WC bps. These results provide atomic insights into WC/HG breathing dynamics in unmodified DNA duplexes as well as identify structural and dynamic signatures that could play roles in m1A recognition and repair.",

        "Abstract": "The replicative and translational machinery utilizes the unique geometry of canonical G\u00b7C and A\u00b7T/U Watson-Crick base pairs to discriminate against DNA and RNA mismatches in order to ensure high fidelity replication, transcription, and translation. There is growing evidence that spontaneous errors occur when mismatches adopt a Watson-Crick-like geometry through tautomerization and/or ionization of the bases. Studies employing NMR relaxation dispersion recently showed that wobble dG\u00b7dT and rG\u00b7rU mismatches in DNA and RNA duplexes transiently form tautomeric and anionic species with probabilities (\u22480.01-0.40%) that are in concordance with replicative and translational errors. Although computational studies indicate that these exceptionally short-lived and low-abundance species form Watson-Crick-like base pairs, their conformation could not be directly deduced from the experimental data, and alternative pairing geometries could not be ruled out. Here, we report direct NMR evidence that the transient tautomeric and anionic species form hydrogen-bonded Watson-Crick-like base pairs.

Results reveal new aspects of polyplex structure with respect to polyplex-bound RNA existing in the following local microenvironments: (a) RNA associated with the polyplex that experiences local pH changes in a manner dependent on POCP nitrogen to RNA phosphate ratio (N:P), (b) RNA experiencing relatively acidic local pH environment that remains constant in polyplexes formed after a charge-neutral ratio, and (c) RNA packed close enough to mediate fluorophore/fluorophore quenching. The magnitude of these changes observed as a function of POCP to nucleic acid N:P ratio is polymer dependent. Assessment of the different microenvironments can help elucidate the functional hierarchy of polyplex-bound oligonucleotides and additionally characterize POCPs based on the resulting local pH and solvent properties upon polyplex formation.",

        "Abstract": "The B-DNA double helix can dynamically accommodate G-C and A-T base pairs in either Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen configurations. Here, we show that G-C(+) (in which + indicates protonation) and A-U Hoogsteen base pairs are strongly disfavored in A-RNA. As a result,N(1)-methyladenosine and N(1)-methylguanosine, which occur in DNA as a form of alkylation damage and in RNA as post-transcriptional modifications, have dramatically different consequences. Whereas they create G-C(+) and A-T Hoogsteen base pairs in duplex DNA, thereby maintaining the structural integrity of the double helix, they block base-pairing and induce local duplex melting in RNA. These observations provide a mechanism for disrupting RNA structure through post-transcriptional modifications. The different propensities to form Hoogsteen base pairs in B-DNA and A-RNA may help cells meet the opposing requirements of maintaining genome stability, on the one hand, and of dynamically modulating the structure of the epitranscriptome, on the other.",

        "Abstract": "Structured RNAs fold through multiple pathways, but we have little understanding of the molecular features that dictate folding pathways and determine rates along a given pathway. Here, we asked whether folding of a complex RNA can be understood from its structural modules. In a two-piece version of the Tetrahymena group I ribozyme, the separated P5abc subdomain folds to local native secondary and tertiary structure in a linked transition and assembles with the ribozyme core via three tertiary contacts: a kissing loop (P14), a metal core-receptor interaction, and a tetraloop-receptor interaction, the first two of which are expected to depend on native P5abc structure from the local transition. Native gel, NMR, and chemical footprinting experiments showed that mutations that destabilize the native P5abc structure slowed assembly up to 100-fold, indicating that P5abc folds first and then assembles with the core by conformational selection. However, rate decreases beyond 100-fold were not observed because an alternative pathway becomes dominant, with nonnative P5abc binding the core and then undergoing an induced-fit rearrangement. P14 is formed in the rate-limiting step along the conformational selection pathway but after the rate-limiting step along the induced-fit pathway. Strikingly, the assembly rate along the conformational selection pathway resembles that of an isolated kissing loop similar to P14, and the rate along the induced-fit pathway resembles that of an isolated tetraloop-receptor interaction. Our results indicate substantial modularity in RNA folding and assembly and suggest that these processes can be understood in terms of underlying structural modules.",

        "Abstract": "Intermediates play important roles in RNA folding but can be difficult to characterize when short-lived or not significantly populated. By combining (15)N relaxation dispersion NMR with chemical probing, we visualized a fast (kex=k1+k-1\u2248423\u2009s(-1)) secondary structural switch directed towards a low-populated (\u223c3%) partially folded intermediate in tertiary folding of the P5abc subdomain of the 'Tetrahymena' group I intron ribozyme. The secondary structure switch changes the base-pairing register across the P5c hairpin, creating a native-like structure, and occurs at rates of more than two orders of magnitude faster than tertiary folding. The switch occurs robustly in the absence of tertiary interactions, Mg(2+) or even when the hairpin is excised from the three-way junction. Fast, highly modular secondary structural switches may be quite common during RNA tertiary folding where they may help smoothen the folding landscape by allowing folding to proceed efficiently via additional pathways.",

        "Abstract": "Helix-junction-helix (HJH) motifs are flexible building blocks of RNA architecture that help define the orientation and dynamics of helical domains. They are also frequently involved in adaptive recognition of proteins and small molecules and in the formation of tertiary contacts. Here, we use a battery of nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to examine how deleting a single bulge residue (C24) from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transactivation response element (TAR) trinucleotide bulge (U23-C24-U25) affects dynamics over a broad range of time scales. Shortening the bulge has an effect on picosecond-to-nanosecond interhelical and local bulge dynamics similar to that casued by increasing the Mg(2+) and Na(+) concentration, whereby a preexisting two-state equilibrium in TAR is shifted away from a bent flexible conformation toward a coaxial conformation, in which all three bulge residues are flipped out and flexible. Surprisingly, the point deletion minimally affects microsecond-to-millisecond conformational exchange directed toward two low-populated and short-lived excited conformational states that form through reshuffling of bases pairs throughout TAR. The mutant does, however, adopt a slightly different excited conformational state on the millisecond time scale, in which U23 is intrahelical, mimicking the expected conformation of residue C24 in the excited conformational state of wild-type TAR. Thus, minor changes in HJH topology preserve motional modes in RNA occurring over the picosecond-to-millisecond time scales but alter the relative populations of the sampled states or cause subtle changes in their conformational features.",

        "Abstract": "Naturally occurring L-glutamine riboswitches occur in cyanobacteria and marine metagenomes, where they reside upstream of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism. By combining X-ray, NMR, and MD, we characterized an L-glutamine-dependent conformational transition in the Synechococcus elongatus glutamine riboswitch from tuning fork to L-shaped alignment of stem segments. This transition generates an open ligand-binding pocket with L-glutamine selectivity enforced by Mg(2+)-mediated intermolecular interactions. The transition also stabilizes the P1 helix through a long-range \"linchpin\" Watson-Crick G-C pair-capping interaction, while melting a short helix below P1 potentially capable of modulating downstream readout. NMR data establish that the ligand-free glutamine riboswitch in Mg(2+) solution exists in a slow equilibrium between flexible tuning fork and a minor conformation, similar, but not identical, to the L-shaped bound conformation. We propose that an open ligand-binding pocket combined with a high conformational penalty for forming the ligand-bound state provide mechanisms for reducing binding affinity while retaining high selectivity.",

        "Abstract": "A combination of solution NMR, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and fluorescence quenching assays were employed to obtain insights into the dynamics and structural features of a polyplex system consisting of HIV-1 transactivation response element (TAR) and PEGylated generation 5 poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (G5-PEG). NMR chemical shift mapping and (13)C spin relaxation based dynamics measurements depict the polyplex system as a highly dynamic assembly where the RNA, with its local structure and dynamics preserved, rapidly exchanges (<ms) between free and polyplex-bound forms, at least for the probed N/P ratios. Recovery of quenched fluorescence shows that RNA in the polyplex can be competitively exchanged over a wide range of amine to phosphate (N/P) charge ratios. The rapid exchange between free and bound forms may contribute to the mechanism by which RNA is released into the cell upon delivery while being protected by the polyplex environment from immediate degradation by nucleases.",

        "Abstract": "A key effector route of the Sugar Code involves lectins that exert crucial regulatory controls by targeting distinct cellular glycans. We demonstrate that a\u00a0single amino-acid substitution in a banana lectin, replacing histidine 84 with a threonine, significantly\u00a0reduces its mitogenicity, while preserving its broad-spectrum antiviral potency. X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and glycocluster assays reveal that loss of mitogenicity is strongly correlated with loss of pi-pi stacking between aromatic amino acids H84 and Y83, which removes a wall separating two carbohydrate binding sites, thus diminishing multivalent interactions. On the other hand, monovalent interactions and antiviral activity are preserved by retaining other wild-type conformational features and possibly through unique contacts involving the T84 side chain. Through such fine-tuning, target selection and downstream effects of a lectin can be modulated so as to knock down one activity, while preserving another, thus providing tools for therapeutics and for understanding the Sugar Code.",

        "Abstract": "A requirement for specific RNA folding is that the free-energy landscape discriminate against non-native folds. While tertiary interactions are critical for stabilizing the native fold, they are relatively non-specific, suggesting additional mechanisms contribute to tertiary folding specificity. In this study, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to explore how secondary structure shapes the tertiary free-energy landscape of the Azoarcus ribozyme. We show that steric and connectivity constraints posed by secondary structure strongly limit the accessible conformational space of the ribozyme, and that these so-called topological constraints in turn pose strong free-energy penalties on forming different tertiary contacts. Notably, native A-minor and base-triple interactions form with low conformational free energy, while non-native tetraloop/tetraloop-receptor interactions are penalized by high conformational free energies. Topological constraints also give rise to strong cooperativity between distal tertiary interactions, quantitatively matching prior experimental measurements. The specificity of the folding landscape is further enhanced as tertiary contacts place additional constraints on the conformational space, progressively funneling the molecule to the native state. These results indicate that secondary structure assists the ribozyme in navigating the otherwise rugged tertiary folding landscape, and further emphasize topological constraints as a key force in RNA folding.",

        "Abstract": "Detecting conformational heterogeneity in biological macromolecules is a key for the understanding of their biological function. We here provide a comparison between two independent approaches to assess conformational heterogeneity: molecular dynamics simulations, performed without inclusion of any experimental data, and maximum occurrence (MaxOcc) distribution over the topologically available conformational space. The latter only reflects the extent of the averaging and identifies regions which are most compliant with the experimentally measured NMR Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs). The analysis was performed for the HIV-1 TAR RNA, consisting of two helical domains connected by a flexible bulge junction, for which four sets of RDCs were available as well as an 8.2 \u03bcs all-atom molecular dynamics simulation. A sample and select approach was previously applied to extract from the molecular dynamics trajectory conformational ensembles in agreement with the four sets of RDCs. The MaxOcc analysis performed here identifies the most likely sampled region in the conformational space of the system which, strikingly, overlaps well with the structures independently sampled in the molecular dynamics calculations and even better with the RDC selected ensemble.",

        "Abstract": "Approaches that combine experimental data and computational molecular dynamics (MD) to determine atomic resolution ensembles of biomolecules require the measurement of abundant experimental data. NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) carry rich dynamics information, however, difficulties in modulating overall alignment of nucleic acids have limited the ability to fully extract this information. We present a strategy for modulating RNA alignment that is based on introducing variable dynamic kinks in terminal helices. With this strategy, we measured seven sets of RDCs in a cUUCGg apical loop and used this rich data set to test the accuracy of an 0.8 \u03bcs MD simulation computed using the Amber ff10 force field as well as to determine an atomic resolution ensemble. The MD-generated ensemble quantitatively reproduces the measured RDCs, but selection of a sub-ensemble was required to satisfy the RDCs within error. The largest discrepancies between the RDC-selected and MD-generated ensembles are observed for the most flexible loop residues and backbone angles connecting the loop to the helix, with the RDC-selected ensemble resulting in more uniform dynamics. Comparison of the RDC-selected ensemble with NMR spin relaxation data suggests that the dynamics occurs on the ps-ns time scales as verified by measurements of R(1\u03c1) relaxation-dispersion data. The RDC-satisfying ensemble samples many conformations adopted by the hairpin in crystal structures indicating that intrinsic plasticity may play important roles in conformational adaptation. The approach presented here can be applied to test nucleic acid force fields and to characterize dynamics in diverse RNA motifs at atomic resolution.",

        "Title": "Unveiling Inherent Degeneracies in Determining Population-Weighted Ensembles of Interdomain Orientational Distributions Using NMR Residual Dipolar Couplings: Application to RNA Helix Junction Helix Motifs.",
        "Abstract": "A growing number of studies employ time-averaged experimental data to determine dynamic ensembles of biomolecules. While it is well-known that different ensembles can satisfy experimental data to within error, the extent and nature of these degeneracies, and their impact on the accuracy of the ensemble determination remains poorly understood. Here, we use simulations and a recently introduced metric for assessing ensemble similarity to explore degeneracies in determining ensembles using NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) with specific application to A-form helices in RNA. Various target ensembles were constructed representing different domain-domain orientational distributions that are confined to a topologically restricted (<10%) conformational space. Five independent sets of ensemble averaged RDCs were then computed for each target ensemble and a \"sample and select\" scheme used to identify degenerate ensembles that satisfy RDCs to within experimental uncertainty. We find that ensembles with different ensemble sizes and that can differ significantly from the target ensemble (by as much as \u2211\u03a9 \u223c 0.4 where \u2211\u03a9 varies between 0 and 1 for maximum and minimum ensemble similarity, respectively) can satisfy the ensemble averaged RDCs. These deviations increase with the number of unique conformers and breadth of the target distribution, and result in significant uncertainty in determining conformational entropy (as large as 5 kcal/mol at T = 298 K). Nevertheless, the RDC-degenerate ensembles are biased toward populated regions of the target ensemble, and capture other essential features of the distribution, including the shape. Our results identify ensemble size as a major source of uncertainty in determining ensembles and suggest that NMR interactions such as RDCs and spin relaxation, on their own, do not carry the necessary information needed to determine conformational entropy at a useful level of precision. The framework introduced here provides a general approach for exploring degeneracies in ensemble determination for different types of experimental data.",

        "Title": "Slowdown of Interhelical Motions Induces a Glass Transition in RNA.",
        "Abstract": "RNA function depends crucially on the details of its dynamics. The simplest RNA dynamical unit is a two-way interhelical junction. Here, for such a unit--the transactivation response RNA element--we present evidence from molecular dynamics simulations, supported by nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation experiments, for a dynamical transition near 230 K. This glass transition arises from the freezing out of collective interhelical motional modes. The motions, resolved with site-specificity, are dynamically heterogeneous and exhibit non-Arrhenius relaxation. The microscopic origin of the glass transition is a low-dimensional, slow manifold consisting largely of the Euler angles describing interhelical reorientation. Principal component analysis over a range of temperatures covering the glass transition shows that the abrupt slowdown of motion finds its explanation in a localization transition that traps probability density into several disconnected conformational pools over the low-dimensional energy landscape. Upon temperature increase, the probability density pools then flood a larger basin, akin to a lakes-to-sea transition. Simulations on transactivation response RNA are also used to backcalculate inelastic neutron scattering data that match previous inelastic neutron scattering measurements on larger and more complex RNA structures and which, upon normalization, give temperature-dependent fluctuation profiles that overlap onto a glass transition curve that is quasi-universal over a range of systems and techniques.",

        "Title": "Characterizing RNA Excited States Using NMR Relaxation Dispersion.",
        "Abstract": "Changes in RNA secondary structure play fundamental roles in the cellular functions of a growing number of noncoding RNAs. This chapter describes NMR-based approaches for characterizing microsecond-to-millisecond changes in RNA secondary structure that are directed toward short-lived and low-populated species often referred to as \"excited states.\" Compared to larger scale changes in RNA secondary structure, transitions toward excited states do not require assistance from chaperones, are often orders of magnitude faster, and are localized to a small number of nearby base pairs in and around noncanonical motifs. Here, we describe a procedure for characterizing RNA excited states using off-resonance R1\u03c1 NMR relaxation dispersion utilizing low-to-high spin-lock fields (25-3000 Hz). R1\u03c1 NMR relaxation dispersion experiments are used to measure carbon and nitrogen chemical shifts in base and sugar moieties of the excited state. The chemical shift data are then interpreted with the aid of secondary structure prediction to infer potential excited states that feature alternative secondary structures. Candidate structures are then tested by using mutations, single-atom substitutions, or by changing physiochemical conditions, such as pH and temperature, to either stabilize or destabilize the candidate excited state. The resulting chemical shifts of the mutants or under different physiochemical conditions are then compared to those of the ground and excited states. Application is illustrated with a focus on the transactivation response element from the human immune deficiency virus type 1, which exists in dynamic equilibrium with at least two distinct excited states.",

        "Abstract": "Hoogsteen (HG) base pairs (bps) provide an alternative pairing geometry to Watson-Crick (WC) bps and can play unique functional roles in duplex DNA. Here, we use structural features unique to HG bps (syn purine base, HG hydrogen bonds and constricted C1'-C1' distance across the bp) to search for HG bps in X-ray structures of DNA duplexes in the Protein Data Bank. The survey identifies 106 A\u2022T and 34 G\u2022C HG bps in DNA duplexes, many of which are undocumented in the literature. It also uncovers HG-like bps with syn purines lacking HG hydrogen bonds or constricted C1'-C1' distances that are analogous to conformations that have been proposed to populate the WC-to-HG transition pathway. The survey reveals HG preferences similar to those observed for transient HG bps in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance, including stronger preferences for A\u2022T versus G\u2022C bps, TA versus GG steps, and also suggests enrichment at terminal ends with a preference for 5'-purine. HG bps induce small local perturbations in neighboring bps and, surprisingly, a small but significant degree of DNA bending (\u223c14\u00b0) directed toward the major groove. The survey provides insights into the preferences and structural consequences of HG bps in duplex DNA.",

Using NMR relaxation dispersion, we show here that wobble dG\u2022dT and rG\u2022rU mispairs in DNA and RNA duplexes exist in dynamic equilibrium with short-lived, low-populated Watson-Crick-like mispairs that are stabilized by rare enolic or anionic bases. These mispairs can evade Watson-Crick fidelity checkpoints and form with probabilities (10(-3) to 10(-5)) that strongly imply a universal role in replication and translation errors. Our results indicate that rare tautomeric and anionic bases are widespread in nucleic acids, expanding their structural and functional complexity beyond that attainable with canonical bases.",

How these noncanonical tRNAs compensate for their loss of tertiary interactions remains unclear. Furthermore, in human mt-tRNA(Ser), lengthening the variable loop by the 7472insC mutation reduces mt-tRNA(Ser) concentration in vivo through poorly understood mechanisms and is strongly associated with diseases such as deafness and epilepsy. Using simulations of the TOPRNA coarse-grained model, we show that increased topological constraints encoded by the unique secondary structure of wild-type mt-tRNA(Ser) decrease the entropic cost of folding by \u223c2.5 kcal/mol compared to canonical tRNA, offsetting its loss of tertiary interactions. Further simulations show that the pathogenic 7472insC mutation disrupts topological constraints and hence destabilizes the mutant mt-tRNA(Ser) by \u223c0.6 kcal/mol relative to wild-type. UV melting experiments confirm that insertion mutations lower mt-tRNA(Ser) melting temperature by 6-9 \u00b0C and increase the folding free energy by 0.8-1.7 kcal/mol in a largely sequence- and salt-independent manner, in quantitative agreement with our simulation predictions. Our results show that topological constraints provide a quantitative framework for describing key aspects of RNA folding behavior and also provide the first evidence of a pathogenic mutation that is due to disruption of topological constraints.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have shown that basic steric and connectivity constraints encoded at the secondary structure level are key determinants of 3D structure and dynamics in simple two-way RNA junctions. However, the role of these topological constraints in higher order RNA junctions remains poorly understood. Here, we use a specialized coarse-grained molecular dynamics model to directly probe the thermodynamic contributions of topological constraints in defining the 3D architecture and dynamics of transfer RNA (tRNA). Topological constraints alone restrict tRNA's allowed conformational space by over an order of magnitude and strongly discriminate against formation of non-native tertiary contacts, providing a sequence independent source of folding specificity. Topological constraints also give rise to long-range correlations between the relative orientation of tRNA's helices, which in turn provides a mechanism for encoding thermodynamic cooperativity between distinct tertiary interactions. These aspects of topological constraints make it such that only several tertiary interactions are needed to confine tRNA to its native global structure and specify functionally important 3D dynamics. We further show that topological constraints are conserved across tRNA's different naturally occurring secondary structures. Taken together, our results emphasize the central role of secondary-structure-encoded topological constraints in defining RNA 3D structure, dynamics and folding.",

Here, using nuclear magnetic resonance R1\u03c1 relaxation dispersion, we show that transient HG base pairs occur across more diverse sequence and positional contexts than previously anticipated. We observe sequence-specific variations in HG base pair energetic stabilities that are comparable with variations in WC base pair stability, with HG base pairs being more abundant for energetically less favourable WC base pairs. Our results suggest that the variations in HG stabilities and rates of formation are dominated by variations in WC base pair stability, suggesting a late transition state for the WC-to-HG conformational switch. The occurrence of sequence and position-dependent HG base pairs provide a new potential mechanism for achieving sequence-dependent DNA transactions.",

This is accomplished by a global change in strand register, in which bulge residues pair up with residues in the upper stem, causing a reshuffling of base pairs that propagates to the tip of apical loop, resulting in the creation of three noncanonical base pairs. Our results show that transient states can remodel distant RNA motifs and possibly give rise to mechanisms for rapid long-range communication in RNA that can be harnessed in processes such as cooperative folding and ribonucleoprotein assembly.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the active sites of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent methyltransferases form strong carbon-oxygen (CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O) hydrogen bonds with the substrate's sulfonium group that are important in AdoMet binding and catalysis. To probe these interactions, we substituted the noncanonical amino acid p-aminophenylalanine (pAF) for the active site tyrosine in the lysine methyltransferase SET7/9, which forms multiple CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds to AdoMet and is invariant in SET domain enzymes. Using quantum chemistry calculations to predict the mutation's effects, coupled with biochemical and structural studies, we observed that pAF forms a strong CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bond to AdoMet that is offset by an energetically unfavorable amine group rotamer within the SET7/9 active site that hinders AdoMet binding and activity. Together, these results illustrate that the invariant tyrosine in SET domain methyltransferases functions as an essential hydrogen bonding hub and cannot be readily substituted by residues bearing other hydrogen bond acceptors.",

        "Abstract": "Spin relaxation in the rotating frame (R1\u03c1) is a powerful NMR technique for characterizing fast microsecond timescale exchange processes directed toward short-lived excited states in biomolecules. At the limit of fast exchange, only k(ex)=k(1)+k(-1) and \u03a6ex=p(G)p(E)(\u0394\u03c9)(2) can be determined from R1\u03c1 data limiting the ability to characterize the structure and energetics of the excited state conformation. Here, we use simulations to examine the uncertainty with which exchange parameters can be determined for two state systems in intermediate-to-fast exchange using off-resonance R1\u03c1 relaxation dispersion. R1\u03c1 data computed by solving the Bloch-McConnell equations reveals small but significant asymmetry with respect to offset (R1\u03c1 (\u0394\u03a9)\u2260R1\u03c1 (-\u0394\u03a9)), which is a hallmark of slow-to-intermediate exchange, even under conditions of fast exchange for free precession chemical exchange line broadening (k(ex)/\u0394\u03c9>10). A grid search analysis combined with bootstrap and Monte-Carlo based statistical approaches for estimating uncertainty in exchange parameters reveals that both the sign and magnitude of \u0394\u03c9 can be determined at a useful level of uncertainty for systems in fast exchange (k(ex)/\u0394\u03c9<10) but that this depends on the uncertainty in the R1\u03c1 data and requires a thorough examination of the multidimensional variation of \u03c7(2) as a function of exchange parameters. Results from simulations are complemented by analysis of experimental R1\u03c1 data measured in three nucleic acid systems with exchange processes occurring on the slow (k(ex)/\u0394\u03c9=0.2; pE=\u223c0.7%), fast (k(ex)/\u0394\u03c9=\u223c10-16; p(E)=\u223c13%) and very fast (k(ex)=39,000 s(-1)) chemical shift timescales.",

        "Abstract": "Ribosomes control the missense error rate of ~10(-4) during translation though quantitative contributions of individual mechanistic steps of the conformational changes yet to be fully determined. Biochemical and biophysical studies led to a qualitative tRNA selection model in which ribosomal A-site residues A1492 and A1493 (A1492/3) flip out in response to cognate tRNA binding, promoting the subsequent reactions, but not in the case of near-cognate or non-cognate tRNA. However, this model was recently questioned by X-ray structures revealing conformations of extrahelical A1492/3 and domain closure of the decoding center in both cognate and near-cognate tRNA bound ribosome complexes, suggesting that the non-specific flipping of A1492/3 has no active role in tRNA selection. We explore this question by carrying out molecular dynamics simulations, aided with fluorescence and NMR experiments, to probe the free energy cost of extrahelical flipping of 1492/3 and the strain energy associated with domain conformational change. Our rigorous calculations demonstrate that the A1492/3 flipping is indeed a specific response to the binding of cognate tRNA, contributing 3kcal/mol to the specificity of tRNA selection. Furthermore, the different A-minor interactions in cognate and near-cognate complexes propagate into the conformational strain and contribute another 4kcal/mol in domain closure. The recent structure of ribosome with features of extrahelical A1492/3 and closed domain in near-cognate complex is reconciled by possible tautomerization of the wobble base pair in mRNA-tRNA. These results quantitatively rationalize other independent experimental observations and explain the ribosomal discrimination mechanism of selecting cognate versus near-cognate tRNA.",

        "Abstract": "Many regulatory RNAs contain long single strands (ssRNA) that adjoin secondary structural elements. Here, we use NMR spectroscopy to study the dynamic properties of a 12-nucleotide (nt) ssRNA tail derived from the prequeuosine riboswitch linked to the 3' end of a 48-nt hairpin. Analysis of chemical shifts, NOE connectivity, (13)C spin relaxation, and residual dipolar coupling data suggests that the first two residues (A25 and U26) in the ssRNA tail stack onto the adjacent helix and assume an ordered conformation. The following U26-A27 step marks the beginning of an A6-tract and forms an acute pivot point for substantial motions within the tail, which increase toward the terminal end. Despite substantial internal motions, the ssRNA tail adopts, on average, an A-form helical conformation that is coaxial with the helix. Our results reveal a surprising degree of structural and dynamic complexity at the ssRNA-helix junction, which involves a fine balance between order and disorder that may facilitate efficient pseudoknot formation on ligand recognition.",

These high energy purine-pyrimidine base-pairs include G\u2022C(+) and A\u2022T Hoogsteen base-pairs, which entail \u223c180\u00b0 rotation of the purine base in a Watson-Crick base-pair, protonation of cytosine N3, and constriction of the C1'-C1' distance by \u223c2.5\u00c5. Other high energy pure-pyrimidine base-pairs include G\u2022T, G\u2022U, and A\u2022C mispairs that adopt Watson-Crick like geometry through either base ionization or tautomerization. Although difficult to detect and characterize using biophysical methods, high energy purine-pyrimidine base-pairs appear to be more common than once thought. They further expand the structural and functional diversity of canonical and non-canonical nucleic acid base-pairs.",

However, there is no general framework to describe these complex processes, which typically consist of many structural maneuvers that occur over timescales ranging from picoseconds to seconds. Here, we classify RNA dynamics into distinct modes representing transitions between basins on a hierarchical free-energy landscape. These transitions include large-scale secondary-structural transitions at >0.1-s timescales, base-pair/tertiary dynamics at microsecond-to-millisecond timescales, stacking dynamics at timescales ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds, and other \"jittering\" motions at timescales ranging from picoseconds to nanoseconds. We review various modes within these three different tiers, the different mechanisms by which they are used to regulate function, and how they can be coupled together to achieve greater functional complexity.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have shown that simple stereochemical constraints encoded at the RNA secondary structure level significantly restrict the orientation of RNA helices across two-way junctions and yield physically reasonable distributions of RNA 3D conformations. Here we develop a new coarse-grain model, TOPRNA, that is optimized for exploring detailed aspects of these topological constraints in complex RNA systems. Unlike prior models, TOPRNA effectively treats RNAs as collections of semirigid helices linked by freely rotatable single strands, allowing us to isolate the effects of secondary structure connectivity and sterics on 3D structure. Simulations of bulge junctions show that TOPRNA captures new aspects of topological constraints, including variations arising from deviations in local A-form structure, translational displacements of the helices, and stereochemical constraints imposed by bulge-linker nucleotides. Notably, these aspects of topological constraints define free energy landscapes that coincide with the distribution of bulge conformations in the PDB. Our simulations also quantitatively reproduce NMR RDC measurements made on HIV-1 TAR at low salt concentrations, although not for different TAR mutants or at high salt concentrations. Our results confirm that topological constraints are an important determinant of bulge conformation and dynamics and demonstrate the utility of TOPRNA for studying the topological constraints of complex RNAs.",

How do nucleic acids introduce flexibility into their 3D structure without losing biological specificity? Here, I describe the development and application of NMR spectroscopic techniques in my laboratory for characterizing the dynamic properties of nucleic acids that tightly integrate a broad set of NMR measurements, including residual dipolar couplings, spin relaxation, and relaxation dispersion with sample engineering and computational approaches.

A survey of high-resolution crystal structures reveals that unconventional carbon-oxygen (CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O) hydrogen bonds coordinate the AdoMet methyl group in different methyltransferases irrespective of their class, active site structure, or cofactor binding conformation. Corroborating these observations, quantum chemistry calculations demonstrate that these charged interactions formed by the AdoMet sulfonium cation are stronger than typical CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds. Biochemical and structural studies using a model lysine methyltransferase and an active site mutant that abolishes CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonding to AdoMet illustrate that these interactions are important for high-affinity AdoMet binding and transition-state stabilization. Further, crystallographic and NMR dynamics experiments of the wild-type enzyme demonstrate that the CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds constrain the motion of the AdoMet methyl group, potentially facilitating its alignment during catalysis. Collectively, the experimental findings with the model methyltransferase and structural survey imply that methyl CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonding represents a convergent evolutionary feature of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, mediating a universal mechanism for methyl transfer.",

        "Abstract": "Riboswitches are structural elements in the 5' untranslated regions of many bacterial messenger RNAs that regulate gene expression in response to changing metabolite concentrations by inhibition of either transcription or translation initiation. The preQ1 (7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine) riboswitch family comprises some of the smallest metabolite sensing RNAs found in nature. Once ligand-bound, the transcriptional Bacillus subtilis and translational Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis preQ1 riboswitch aptamers are structurally similar RNA pseudoknots; yet, prior structural studies have characterized their ligand-free conformations as largely unfolded and folded, respectively. In contrast, through single molecule observation, we now show that, at near-physiological Mg(2+) concentration and pH, both ligand-free aptamers adopt similar pre-folded state ensembles that differ in their ligand-mediated folding. Structure-based G\u014d-model simulations of the two aptamers suggest that the ligand binds late (Bacillus subtilis) and early (Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis) relative to pseudoknot folding, leading to the proposal that the principal distinction between the two riboswitches lies in their relative tendencies to fold via mechanisms of conformational selection and induced fit, respectively. These mechanistic insights are put to the test by rationally designing a single nucleotide swap distal from the ligand binding pocket that we find to predictably control the aptamers' pre-folded states and their ligand binding affinities.",

        "Abstract": "Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is widely used as a cosolvent to solubilize hydrophobic compounds in RNA-ligand binding assays. Although it is known that high concentrations of DMSO (>75%) can significantly affect RNA structure and folding energetics, a thorough analysis of how lower concentrations (<10%) of DMSO typically used in binding assays affects RNA structure and ligand binding has not been undertaken. Here, we use NMR and 2-aminopurine fluorescence spectroscopy to examine how DMSO affects the structure, dynamics, and ligand binding properties of two flexible hairpin RNAs: the transactivation response element from HIV-1 and bacterial ribosomal A-site. In both cases, 5-10% DMSO decreased stacking interactions and increased local disorder in noncanonical residues within bulges and loops and resulted in 0.3-4-fold reduction in the measured binding affinities for different small molecules, with the greatest reduction observed for an intercalating compound that binds RNA nonspecifically. Our results suggest that, by competing for hydrophobic interactions, DMSO can have a small but significant effect on RNA structure and ligand binding. These effects should be considered when developing ligand binding assays and high throughput screens.",

        "Title": "A historical account of Hoogsteen base-pairs in duplex DNA.",
        "Abstract": "In 1957, a unique pattern of hydrogen bonding between N3 and O4 on uracil and N7 and N6 on adenine was proposed to explain how poly(rU) strands can associate with poly(rA)-poly(rU) duplexes to form triplexes. Two years later, Karst Hoogsteen visualized such a noncanonical A-T base-pair through X-ray analysis of co-crystals containing 9-methyladenine and 1-methylthymine. Subsequent X-ray analyses of guanine and cytosine derivatives yielded the expected Watson-Crick base-pairing, but those of adenine and thymine (or uridine) did not yield Watson-Crick base-pairs, instead favoring \"Hoogsteen\" base-pairing. More than two decades ensued without experimental \"proof\" for A-T Watson-Crick base-pairs, while Hoogsteen base-pairs continued to surface in AT-rich sequences, closing base-pairs of apical loops, in structures of DNA bound to antibiotics and proteins, damaged and chemically modified DNA, and in polymerases that replicate DNA via Hoogsteen pairing. Recently, NMR studies have shown that base-pairs in duplex DNA exist as a dynamic equilibrium between Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen forms. There is now little doubt that Hoogsteen base-pairs exist in significant abundance in genomic DNA, where they can expand the structural and functional versatility of duplex DNA beyond that which can be achieved based only on Watson-Crick base-pairing. Here, we provide a historical account of the discovery and characterization of Hoogsteen base-pairs, hoping that this will inform future studies exploring the occurrence and functional importance of these alternative base-pairs.",

        "Abstract": "G\u00b7C Hoogsteen base pairs can form transiently in duplex DNA and play important roles in DNA recognition, replication, and repair. G\u00b7C Hoogsteen base pairs are thought to be stabilized by protonation of cytosine N3, which affords a second key hydrogen bond, but experimental evidence for this is sparse because the proton cannot be directly visualized by X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Here, we combine NMR and constant pH molecular dynamics simulations to directly investigate the pKa of cytosine N3 in a chemically trapped N1-methyl-G\u00b7C Hoogsteen base pair within duplex DNA. Analysis of NMR chemical shift perturbations and NOESY data as a function of pH revealed that cytosine deprotonation is coupled to a syn-to-anti transition in N1-methyl-G, which results in a distorted Watson-Crick geometry at pH >9. A four-state analysis of the pH titration profiles yields a lower bound pKa estimate of 7.2 \u00b1 0.1 for the G\u00b7C Hoogsteen base pair, which is in good agreement with the pKa value (7.1 \u00b1 0.1) calculated independently using constant pH MD simulations. Based on these results and pH-dependent NMR relaxation dispersion measurements, we estimate that under physiological pH (pH 7-8), G\u00b7C Hoogsteen base pairs in naked DNA have a population of 0.02-0.002%, as compared to 0.4% for A\u00b7T Hoogsteen base pairs, and likely exist primarily as protonated species.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to modulate alignment and measure multiple independent sets of NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) has made it possible to characterize internal motions in proteins at atomic resolution and with time scale sensitivity ranging from picoseconds up to milliseconds. The application of such methods to the study of RNA dynamics, however, remains fundamentally limited by the inability to modulate alignment and by strong couplings between internal and overall motions that complicate the quantitative interpretation of RDCs. Here, we address this problem by showing that RNA alignment can be generally modulated, in a controlled manner, by variable elongation of A-form helices and that the information contained within the measured RDCs can be extracted even in the presence of strong couplings between motions and overall alignment via structure-based prediction of alignment. Using this approach, four RDC data sets, and a broad conformational pool obtained from a 8.2 \u03bcs molecular dynamics simulation, we successfully construct and validate an atomic resolution ensemble of human immunodeficiency virus type I transactivation response element RNA. This ensemble reveals local motions in and around the bulge involving changes in stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions, which are undetectable by traditional spin relaxation and drive global changes in interhelical orientation. This new approach broadens the scope of using RDCs in characterizing the dynamics of nucleic acids.",

Here, we show that (1)H chemical shifts offer powerful restraints for RNA structure determination, allowing discrimination of native structure from non-native states to within 2-4 \u00c5, and <3 \u00c5 when highly flexible residues are ignored. Theoretical simulations shows that although (1)H chemical shifts can provide valuable information for constructing RNA dynamic ensembles, large uncertainties in the chemical shift predictions and inherent degeneracies lead to higher uncertainties as compared to residual dipolar couplings.",

        "Abstract": "The visualization of RNA conformational changes has provided fundamental insights into how regulatory RNAs carry out their biological functions. The RNA structural transitions that have been characterized so far involve long-lived species that can be captured by structure characterization techniques. Here we report the nuclear magnetic resonance visualization of RNA transitions towards 'invisible' excited states (ESs), which exist in too little abundance (2-13%) and for too short a duration (45-250\u2009\u03bcs) to allow structural characterization by conventional techniques. Transitions towards ESs result in localized rearrangements in base-pairing that alter building block elements of RNA architecture, including helix-junction-helix motifs and apical loops. The ES can inhibit function by sequestering residues involved in recognition and signalling or promote ATP-independent strand exchange. Thus, RNAs do not adopt a single conformation, but rather exist in rapid equilibrium with alternative ESs, which can be stabilized by cellular cues to affect functional outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Sequence-specific DNA flexibility plays a key role in a variety of cellular interactions that are critical for gene packaging, expression, and regulation, yet few studies have experimentally explored the sequence dependence of DNA dynamics that occur on biologically relevant time scales. Here, we use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) carbon spin relaxation combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the picosecond to nanosecond dynamics in a variety of dinucleotide steps as well as in varying length homopolymeric A(n)\u00b7T(n) repeats (A(n)-tracts, where n = 2, 4, or 6) that exhibit unusual structural and mechanical properties. We extend the NMR spin relaxation time scale sensitivity deeper into the nanosecond regime by using glycerol and a longer DNA duplex to slow overall tumbling. Our studies reveal a structurally unique A-tract core (for n > 3) that is uniformly rigid, flanked by junction steps that show increasing sugar flexibility with A-tract length. High sugar mobility is observed at pyrimidine residues at the A-tract junctions, which is encoded at the dinucleotide level (CA, TG, and CG steps) and increases with A-tract length. The MD simulations reproduce many of these trends, particularly the overall rigidity of A-tract base and sugar sites, and suggest that the sugar-backbone dynamics could involve transitions in sugar pucker and phosphate backbone BI \u2194 BII equilibria. Our results reinforce an emerging view that sequence-specific DNA flexibility can be imprinted in dynamics occurring deep within the nanosecond time regime that is difficult to characterize experimentally at the atomic level. Such large-amplitude sequence-dependent backbone fluctuations might flag the genome for specific DNA recognition.",

        "Title": "Incorporation of CC steps into Z-DNA: interplay between B-Z junction and Z-DNA helical formation.",
        "Abstract": "The left-handed DNA structure, Z-DNA, is believed to play important roles in gene expression and regulation. Z-DNA forms sequence-specifically with a preference for sequences rich in pyrimidine/purine dinucleotide steps. In vivo, Z-DNA is generated in the presence of negative supercoiling or upon binding proteins that absorb the high energetic cost of the B-to-Z transition, including the creation of distorted junctions between B-DNA and Z-DNA. To date, the sequence preferences for the B-to-Z transition have primarily been studied in the context of sequence repeats lacking B-Z junctions. Here, we develop a method for characterizing sequence-specific preferences for Z-DNA formation and B-Z junction localization within heterogeneous DNA duplexes that is based on combining 2-aminopurine fluorescence measurements with a new quantitative application of circular dichroism spectroscopy for determining the fraction of B- versus Z-DNA. Using this approach, we show that at least three consecutive CC dinucleotide steps, traditionally thought to disfavor Z-DNA, can be incorporated within heterogeneous Z-DNA containing B-Z junctions upon binding to the Z\u03b1 domain of the RNA adenosine deaminase protein. Our results indicate that the incorporation of CC steps into Z-DNA is driven by favorable sequence-specific Z-Z and B-Z stacking interactions as well as by sequence-specific energetics that localize the distorted B-Z junction at flexible sites. Together, our results expose higher-order complexities in the Z-DNA code within heterogeneous sequences and suggest that Z-DNA can in principle propagate into a wider range of genomic sequence elements than previously thought.",

        "Abstract": "The transfer of genetic material into cells using nonviral vectors offers unique potential for therapeutics; however, the efficacy of delivery depends upon a poorly understood, multistep pathway, limiting the prospects for successful gene delivery. Mechanistic insight into DNA association and release has been hampered by a lack of atomic resolution structural and dynamic information for DNA-polymer complexes (polyplexes). Here, we report a dendrimer-based polyplex system containing poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) arms that is suitable for atomic-level characterization by solution NMR spectroscopy. NMR chemical shift, line width, and proton transverse relaxation rate measurements reveal that free and dendrimer-bound polyplex DNA exchange rapidly relative to the NMR time scale (<millisecond). The dendrimers retain a high degree of mobility in the polyplex, whereas the DNA shows restrained mobility, suggesting that the polyplex is a highly dynamic complex with a rapidly exchanging dendrimer atmosphere around a more rigid DNA framework.",

The mechanisms by which cellular processes harness the intrinsic dynamic behaviour of RNA and use it within functionally productive pathways are complex. The versatile functions and ease by which it is integrated into a wide variety of genetic circuits and biochemical pathways suggests there is a general and fundamental role for RNA dynamics in cellular processes.",

        "Title": "Probing transient Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in canonical duplex DNA using NMR relaxation dispersion and single-atom substitution.",
        "Abstract": "Nucleic acids transiently morph into alternative conformations that can be difficult to characterize at the atomic level by conventional methods because they exist for too little time and in too little abundance. We recently reported evidence for transient Hoogsteen (HG) base pairs in canonical B-DNA based on NMR carbon relaxation dispersion. While the carbon chemical shifts measured for the transient state were consistent with a syn orientation for the purine base, as expected for A(syn)\u2022T(anti) and G(syn)\u2022C(+)(anti) HG base pairing, HG type hydrogen bonding could only be inferred indirectly. Here, we develop two independent approaches for directly probing transient changes in N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bonds and apply them to the characterization of transient Hoogsteen type hydrogen bonds in canonical duplex DNA. The first approach takes advantage of the strong dependence of the imino nitrogen chemical shift on hydrogen bonding and involves measurement of R(1\u03c1) relaxation dispersion for the hydrogen-bond donor imino nitrogens in G and T residues. In the second approach, we assess the consequence of substituting the hydrogen-bond acceptor nitrogen (N7) with a carbon (C7H7) on both carbon and nitrogen relaxation dispersion data. Together, these data allow us to obtain direct evidence for transient Hoogsteen base pairs that are stabilized by N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N type hydrogen bonds in canonical duplex DNA. The methods introduced here greatly expand the utility of NMR in the structural characterization of transient states in nucleic acids.",

        "Abstract": "Single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) are ubiquitous RNA elements that serve diverse functional roles. Much of our understanding of ssRNA conformational behavior is limited to structures in which ssRNA directly engages in tertiary interactions or is recognized by proteins. Little is known about the structural and dynamic behavior of free ssRNAs at atomic resolution. Here, we report the collaborative application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations to characterize the 12 nt ssRNA tail derived from the prequeuosine riboswitch. NMR carbon spin relaxation data and residual dipolar coupling measurements reveal a flexible yet stacked core adopting an A-form-like conformation, with the level of order decreasing toward the terminal ends. An A-to-C mutation within the polyadenine tract alters the observed dynamics consistent with the introduction of a dynamic kink. Pre-ordering of the tail may increase the efficacy of ligand binding above that achieved by a random-coil ssRNA. The REMD simulations recapitulate important trends in the NMR data, but suggest more internal motions than inferred from the NMR analysis. Our study unmasks a previously unappreciated level of complexity in ssRNA, which we believe will also serve as an excellent model system for testing and developing computational force fields.",

        "Title": "3D maps of RNA interhelical junctions.",
        "Abstract": "More than 50% of RNA secondary structure is estimated to be A-form helices, which are linked together by various junctions. Here we describe a protocol for computing three interhelical Euler angles describing the relative orientation of helices across RNA junctions. 5' and 3' helices, H1 and H2, respectively, are assigned based on the junction topology. A reference canonical helix is constructed using an appropriate molecular builder software consisting of two continuous idealized A-form helices (iH1 and iH2) with helix axis oriented along the molecular Z-direction running toward the positive direction from iH1 to iH2. The phosphate groups and the carbon and oxygen atoms of the sugars are used to superimpose helix H1 of a target interhelical junction onto the corresponding iH1 of the reference helix. A copy of iH2 is then superimposed onto the resulting H2 helix to generate iH2'. A rotation matrix R is computed, which rotates iH2' into iH2 and expresses the rotation parameters in terms of three Euler angles \u03b1(h), \u03b2(h) and \u03b3(h). The angles are processed to resolve a twofold degeneracy and to select an overall rotation around the axis of the reference helix. The three interhelical Euler angles define clockwise rotations around the 5' (-\u03b3(h)) and 3' (\u03b1(h)) helices and an interhelical bend angle (\u03b2(h)). The angles can be depicted graphically to provide a 'Ramachandran'-type view of RNA global structure that can be used to identify unusual conformations as well as to understand variations due to changes in sequence, junction topology and other parameters.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have shown that topological constraints encoded at the RNA secondary structure level involving basic steric and stereochemical forces can significantly restrict the orientations sampled by helices across two-way RNA junctions. Here, we formulate these topological constraints in greater quantitative detail and use this topological framework to rationalize long-standing but poorly understood observations regarding the basic behavior of RNA two-way junctions. Notably, we show that the asymmetric nature of the A-form helix and the finite length of a bulge provide a physical basis for the experimentally observed directionality and bulge-length amplitude dependence of bulge induced inter-helical bends. We also find that the topologically allowed space can be modulated by variations in sequence, particularly with the addition of non-canonical GU base pairs at the junction, and, surprisingly, by the length of the 5' and 3' helices. A survey of two-way RNA junctions in the protein data bank confirms that junction residues have a strong preference to adopt looped-in, non-canonically base-paired conformations, providing a route for extending our bulge-directed framework to internal loop motifs and implying a simplified link between secondary and tertiary structure. Finally, our results uncover a new simple mechanism for coupling junction-induced topological constraints with tertiary interactions.",

By docking small molecules onto an RNA dynamic ensemble constructed by combining NMR spectroscopy and computational molecular dynamics, we virtually screened small molecules that target the entire structure landscape of the transactivation response element (TAR) from HIV type 1 (HIV-1). We quantitatively predict binding energies for small molecules that bind different RNA conformations and report the de novo discovery of six compounds that bind TAR with high affinity and inhibit its interaction with a Tat peptide in vitro (K(i) values of 710 nM-169 \u03bcM). One compound binds HIV-1 TAR with marked selectivity and inhibits Tat-mediated activation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat by 81% in T-cell lines and HIV replication in an HIV-1 indicator cell line (IC(50) \u223c23.1 \u03bcM).",

        "Abstract": "The antimicrobial peptide MSI-78 serves as a model system for studying interactions of bioactive peptides with membranes. Using a series of MSI-78 peptides that incorporate l-4,4,4-trifluoroethylglycine, a small and sensitive (19)F nuclear magnetic resonance probe, we investigated how the local structure and dynamics of the peptide change when it binds to the lipid bilayer. The fluorinated MSI-78 analogues exhibited position-specific changes in (19)F chemical shift ranging from 1.28 to -1.35 ppm upon binding to lipid bicelles. The largest upfield shifts are associated with the most hydrophobic positions in the peptide. Changes in solvent isotope effects (H(2)O/D(2)O) on (19)F chemical shifts were observed for the peptides that are consistent with the MSI-78 solvent-inaccessible hydrophobic core upon binding bicelles. Transverse relaxation measurements of the (19)F nucleus, using the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence, were used to examine changes in the local mobility of MSI-78 that occur upon binding to the lipid bilayer. Positions in the hydrophobic core of peptide-membrane complex show the greatest decrease in mobility upon binding of the lipid bilayer, whereas residues that interact with lipid headgroups are more mobile. The most mobile positions are at the N- and C-termini of the peptide. These results provide support for the proposed mechanism of membrane disruption by MSI-78 and reveal new details about the dynamic changes that accompany membrane binding.",

        "Abstract": "Accompanying recent advances in determining RNA secondary structure is the growing appreciation for the importance of relatively simple topological constraints, encoded at the secondary structure level, in defining the overall architecture, folding pathways, and dynamic adaptability of RNA. A new view is emerging in which tertiary interactions do not define RNA 3D structure, but rather, help select specific conformers from an already narrow, topologically pre-defined conformational distribution. Studies are providing fundamental insights into the nature of these topological constraints, how they are encoded by the RNA secondary structure, and how they interplay with other interactions, breathing new meaning to RNA secondary structure. New approaches have been developed that take advantage of topological constraints in determining RNA backbone conformation based on secondary structure, and a limited set of other, easily accessible constraints. Topological constraints are also providing a much-needed framework for rationalizing and describing RNA dynamics and structural adaptation. Finally, studies suggest that topological constraints may play important roles in steering RNA folding pathways. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of topological constraints encoded by the RNA secondary structure.",

        "Abstract": "SET domain lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) are S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent enzymes that catalyze the site-specific methylation of lysyl residues in histone and non-histone proteins. Based on crystallographic and cofactor binding studies, carbon-oxygen (CH \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 O) hydrogen bonds have been proposed to coordinate the methyl groups of AdoMet and methyllysine within the SET domain active site. However, the presence of these hydrogen bonds has only been inferred due to the uncertainty of hydrogen atom positions in x-ray crystal structures. To experimentally resolve the positions of the methyl hydrogen atoms, we used NMR (1)H chemical shift coupled with quantum mechanics calculations to examine the interactions of the AdoMet methyl group in the active site of the human KMT SET7/9. Our results indicated that at least two of the three hydrogens in the AdoMet methyl group engage in CH \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 O hydrogen bonding. These findings represent direct, quantitative evidence of CH \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 O hydrogen bond formation in the SET domain active site and suggest a role for these interactions in catalysis. Furthermore, thermodynamic analysis of AdoMet binding indicated that these interactions are important for cofactor binding across SET domain enzymes.",

        "Abstract": "Conversion of right-handed B-DNA into left-handed Z-DNA is one of the largest structural transitions in biology that plays fundamental roles in gene expression and regulation. Z-DNA segments must form within genomes surrounded by a sea of B-DNA and require creation of energetically costly B/Z junctions. Here, we show using a combination of natural abundance NMR R(1\u03c1) carbon relaxation measurements and CD spectroscopy that sequence-specific B-DNA flexibility modulates the thermodynamic propensity to form Z-DNA and the location of B/Z junctions. We observe sequence-specific flexibility in B-DNA spanning fast (ps-ns) and slow (\u03bcs-ms) time scales localized at the site of B/Z junction formation. Further, our studies show that CG-repeats play an active role tuning this intrinsic B-DNA flexibility. Taken together, our results suggest that sequence-specific B-DNA flexibility may provide a mechanism for defining the length and location of Z-DNA in genomes.",

        "Abstract": "Sequence-directed variations in the canonical DNA double helix structure that retain Watson-Crick base-pairing have important roles in DNA recognition, topology and nucleosome positioning. By using nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion spectroscopy in concert with steered molecular dynamics simulations, we have observed transient sequence-specific excursions away from Watson-Crick base-pairing at CA and TA steps inside canonical duplex DNA towards low-populated and short-lived A\u2022T and G\u2022C Hoogsteen base pairs. The observation of Hoogsteen base pairs in DNA duplexes specifically bound to transcription factors and in damaged DNA sites implies that the DNA double helix intrinsically codes for excited state Hoogsteen base pairs as a means of expanding its structural complexity beyond that which can be achieved based on Watson-Crick base-pairing. The methods presented here provide a new route for characterizing transient low-populated nucleic acid structures, which we predict will be abundant in the genome and constitute a second transient layer of the genetic code.",

        "Abstract": "The melting of base pairs is a ubiquitous feature of RNA structural transitions, which are widely used to sense and respond to cellular stimuli. A recent study employing solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imino proton exchange spectroscopy provides a rare base-pair-specific view of duplex melting in the Salmonella FourU RNA thermosensor, which regulates gene expression in response to changes in temperature at the translational level by undergoing a melting transition. The authors observe \"microscopic\" enthalpy-entropy compensation--often seen \"macroscopically\" across a series of related molecular species--across base pairs within the same RNA. This yields variations in base-pair stabilities that are an order of magnitude smaller than corresponding variations in enthalpy and entropy. A surprising yet convincing link is established between the slopes of enthalpy-entropy correlations and RNA melting points determined by circular dichroism (CD), which argues that unfolding occurs when base-pair stabilities are equalized. A single AG-to-CG mutation, which enhances the macroscopic hairpin thermostability and folding cooperativity and renders the RNA thermometer inactive in vivo, spreads its effect microscopically throughout all base pairs in the RNA, including ones far removed from the site of mutation. The authors suggest that an extended network of hydration underlies this long-range communication. This study suggests that the deconstruction of macroscopic RNA unfolding in terms of microscopic unfolding events will require careful consideration of water interactions.",

        "Abstract": "A variety of biologically active peptides exert their function through direct interactions with the lipid membrane of the cell. These surface interactions are generally transient and highly dynamic, making them hard to study. Here we have examined the feasibility of using solution phase (19)F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study peptide-membrane interactions. Using the antimicrobial peptide MSI-78 as a model system, we demonstrate that peptide binding to either small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) or bicelles can readily be detected by simple one-dimensional (19)F NMR experiments with peptides labeled with l-4,4,4-trifluoroethylglycine. The (19)F chemical shift associated with the peptide-membrane complex is sensitive both to the position of the trifluoromethyl reporter group (whether in the hydrophobic face or positively charged face of the amphipathic peptide) and to the curvature of the lipid bilayer (whether the peptide is bound to SUVs or bicelles). (19)F spin echo experiments using the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence were used to measure the transverse relaxation (T(2)) of the nucleus and thereby examine the local mobility of the MSI-78 analogues bound to bicelles. The fluorine probe positioned in the hydrophobic face of the peptide relaxes at a rate that correlates with the tumbling of the bicelle, suggesting that it is relatively immobile, whereas the probe at the positively charged face relaxes more slowly, indicating this position is much more dynamic. These results are in accord with structural models of MSI-78 bound to lipids and point to the feasibility of using fluorine-labeled peptides to monitor peptide-membrane interactions in living cells.",

        "Abstract": "Functionally critical metals interact with RNA through complex coordination schemes that are currently difficult to visualize at the atomic level under solution conditions. Here, we report a new approach that combines NMR and XAS to resolve and characterize metal binding in the most highly conserved P4 helix of ribonuclease P (RNase P), the ribonucleoprotein that catalyzes the divalent metal ion-dependent maturation of the 5' end of precursor tRNA. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy reveals that the Zn(2+) bound to a P4 helix mimic is six-coordinate, with an average Zn-O/N bond distance of 2.08 A. The EXAFS data also show intense outer-shell scattering indicating that the zinc ion has inner-shell interactions with one or more RNA ligands. NMR Mn(2+) paramagnetic line broadening experiments reveal strong metal localization at residues corresponding to G378 and G379 in B. subtilis RNase P. A new \"metal cocktail\" chemical shift perturbation strategy involving titrations with , Zn(2+), and confirm an inner-sphere metal interaction with residues G378 and G379. These studies present a unique picture of how metals coordinate to the putative RNase P active site in solution, and shed light on the environment of an essential metal ion in RNase P. Our experimental approach presents a general method for identifying and characterizing inner-sphere metal ion binding sites in RNA in solution.",

We constructed comprehensive three-dimensional maps depicting the orientation of A-form helices across RNA junctions in the Protein Data Bank and rationalized our findings with modeling and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We show that the secondary structures of junctions encode readily computable topological constraints that accurately predict the three-dimensional orientation of helices across all two-way junctions. Our results suggest that RNA global conformation is largely defined by topological constraints encoded at the secondary structural level and that tertiary contacts and intermolecular interactions serve to stabilize specific conformers within the topologically allowed ensemble.",

        "Title": "Variable helix elongation as a tool to modulate RNA alignment and motional couplings.",
        "Abstract": "The application of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) in studies of RNA structure and dynamics can be complicated by the presence of couplings between collective helix motions and overall alignment and by the inability to modulate overall alignment of the molecule by changing the ordering medium. Here, we show for a 27-nt TAR RNA construct that variable levels of helix elongation can be used to alter both overall alignment and couplings to collective helix motions in a semi-predictable manner. In the absence of elongation, a four base-pair helix II capped by a UUCG apical loop exhibits a higher degree of order compared to a six base-pair helix I (theta(I)/theta(II)=0.56+/-0.1). The principal S(zz) direction is nearly parallel to the axis of helix II but deviates by approximately 40 degrees relative to the axis of helix I. Elongating helix I by three base-pairs equalizes the alignment of the two helices and pushes the RNA into the motional coupling limit such that the two helices have comparable degrees of order (theta(I)/theta(II)=0.92+/-0.04) and orientations relative to S(zz) ( approximately 17 degrees ). Increasing the length of elongation further to 22 base-pairs pushes the RNA into the motional decoupling limit in which helix I dominates alignment (theta(II)/theta(I)=0.45+/-0.05), with S(zz) orientated nearly parallel to its helix axis. Many of these trends can be rationalized using PALES simulations that employ a previously proposed three-state dynamic ensemble of TAR. Our results provide new insights into motional couplings, offer guidelines for assessing their extent, and suggest that variable degrees of helix elongation can allow access to independent sets of RDCs for characterizing RNA structural dynamics.",

        "Abstract": "The incorporation of extensively fluorinated, or fluorous, analogues of hydrophobic amino acids into proteins potentially provides the opportunity to modulate the physicochemical properties of proteins in a predictable manner. On the basis of the properties of small fluorocarbon molecules, extensively fluorinated proteins should be both more thermodynamically stable and self-segregate through \"fluorous\" interactions between fluorinated amino acids. We have examined the effects of introducing the fluorous leucine analogue l-5,5,5,5',5',5',-hexafluoroleucine (hFLeu) at various positions within the hydrophobic core of a de novo-designed four-alpha-helix bundle protein, alpha(4). The stabilizing effect of hFLeu is strongly dependent on the positions at which it is incorporated, with per-residue DeltaDeltaG(degrees)((fold)) ranging from -0.09 to -0.8 kcal mol(-1) residue(-1). In particular, incorporating hFLeu at all the \"a\" positions or all the \"d\" positions of the hydrophobic core, thereby creating an alternating packing arrangement of leucine and hFLeu, leads to very stably folded proteins that exhibit higher per-residue DeltaDeltaG(degrees)((fold)) values than proteins that are packed entirely with hFleu. We conclude that efficient packing of the fluorous amino acid within the hydrophobic core provides a more important contribution to enhancing protein stability than do fluorocarbon-fluorocarbon interactions between fluorinated protein side chains.",

        "Abstract": "By simplifying the interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance spin relaxation and residual dipolar couplings data, recent developments involving the elongation of RNA helices are providing new atomic insights into the dynamical properties that allow RNA structures to change functionally and adaptively. Domain elongation, in concert with spin relaxation measurements, has allowed the detailed characterization of a hierarchical network of local and collective motional modes occurring at nanosecond timescale that mirror the structural rearrangements that take place following adaptive recognition. The combination of domain elongation with residual dipolar coupling measurements has allowed the experimental three-dimensional visualization of very large amplitude rigid-body helix motions in HIV-1 transactivation response element (TAR) that trace out a highly choreographed trajectory in which the helices twist and bend in a correlated manner. The dynamic trajectory allows unbound TAR to sample many of its ligand bound conformations, indicating that adaptive recognition occurs by \"conformational selection\" rather than \"induced fit.\" These studies suggest that intrinsic flexibility plays essential roles directing RNA conformational changes along specific pathways.",

Titration experiments with constructs representing residues 1-120 or 1-145 of the OSCP reveals that (a) 1 binds to a region of the protein, at the minimum, comprising residues M51, L56, K65, V66, K75, K77, and N92, and (b) binding of 1 induces conformational changes in the OSCP. Control experiments employing a variant of 1 in which a key binding element on the small molecule was deleted; it had no perturbational effect on the spectra of the OSCP, which indicates that the observed changes with 1 represent specific binding interactions. Collectively, these data suggest that 1 might inhibit the enzyme through an allosteric mechanism where binding results in conformational changes that perturb the OSCP-F(1) interface resulting in disrupted communication between the peripheral stalk and the F(1)-domain of the enzyme.",

Atomic level spin relaxation NMR studies of DNA dynamics have been limited to short duplexes in which sensitivity to biologically relevant fluctuations occurring at nanosecond timescales is often inadequate.

Preliminary results suggest the presence of elevated A-tract independent end-fraying internal motions occurring at nanosecond timescales, which evade detection in short DNA constructs and that penetrate deep (7 bp) within the DNA helix and gradually fade away towards the helix interior.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a strategy for constructing atomic resolution dynamical ensembles of RNA molecules, spanning up to millisecond timescales, that combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDC) measured in elongated RNA. The ensembles are generated via a Monte Carlo procedure by selecting snap-shot from an MD trajectory that reproduce experimentally measured RDCs. Using this approach, we construct ensembles for two variants of the transactivation response element (TAR) containing three (HIV-1) and two (HIV-2) nucleotide bulges. The HIV-1 TAR ensemble reveals significant mobility in bulge residues C24 and U25 and to a lesser extent U23 and neighboring helical residue A22 that give rise to large amplitude spatially correlated twisting and bending helical motions. Omission of bulge residue C24 in HIV-2 TAR leads to a significant reduction in both the local mobility in and around the bulge and amplitude of inter-helical bending motions. In contrast, twisting motions of the helices remain comparable in amplitude to HIV-1 TAR and spatial correlations between them increase significantly. Comparison of the HIV-1 TAR dynamical ensemble and ligand bound TAR conformations reveals that several features of the binding pocket and global conformation are dynamically preformed, providing support for adaptive recognition via a 'conformational selection' type mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) provide a unique opportunity for spatially characterizing complex motions in biomolecules with time scale sensitivity extending up to milliseconds. Up to five motionally averaged Wigner rotation elements, (D(0k)2(alphaalpha)), can be determined experimentally using RDCs measured in five linearly independent alignment conditions and applied to define motions of axially symmetric bond vectors. Here, we show that up to 25 motionally averaged Wigner rotation elements, (D(mk)2(alphabetagamma)), can be determined experimentally from multialignment RDCs and used to characterize rigid-body motions of chiral domains. The 25 (D(mk)2(alphabetagamma)) elements form a basis set that allows one to measure motions of a domain relative to an isotropic distribution of reference frames anchored on a second domain (and vice versa), thus expanding the 3D spatial resolution with which motions can be characterized. The 25 (D(mk)2(alphabetagamma)) elements can also be used to fit an ensemble consisting of up to eight equally or six unequally populated states. For more than two domains, changing the identity of the domain governing alignment allows access to new information regarding the correlated nature of the domain fluctuations. Example simulations are provided that validate the theoretical derivation and illustrate the high spatial resolution with which rigid-body domain motions can be characterized using multialignment and multireference RDCs. Our results further motivate the development of experimental approaches for both modulating alignment and anchoring it on specifically targeted domains.",

        "Abstract": "NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful techniques for studying the internal dynamics of biomolecules. Current formalisms approximate the dynamics using simple continuous motional models or models involving discrete jumps between a small number of states. However, no approach currently exists for interpreting NMR data in terms of continuous spatially complex motional paths that may feature more than one distinct maneuver. Here, we present an approach for approximately reconstructing spatially complex continuous motions of chiral domains using NMR anisotropic interactions. The key is to express Wigner matrix elements, which can be determined experimentally using residual dipolar couplings, as a line integral over a curve in configuration space containing an ensemble of conformations and to approximate the curve using a series of geodesic segments. Using this approach and five sets of synthetic residual dipolar couplings computed for five linearly independent alignment conditions, we show that it is theoretically possible to reconstruct salient features of a multisegment interhelical motional trajectory obtained from a 65 ns molecular dynamics simulation of a stem-loop RNA. Our study shows that the 3-D atomic reconstruction of complex motions in biomolecules is within experimental reach.",

        "Abstract": "The HIV-1 transactivation response element (TAR) RNA binds a variety of proteins and is a target for developing anti-HIV therapies. TAR has two primary binding sites: a UCU bulge and a CUGGGA apical loop. We used NMR residual dipolar couplings, carbon spin relaxation (R(1) and R(2)), and relaxation dispersion (R(1rho)) in conjunction with molecular dynamics and mutagenesis to characterize the dynamics of the TAR apical loop and investigate previously proposed long-range interactions with the distant bulge. Replacement of the wild-type apical loop with a UUCG loop did not significantly affect the structural dynamics at the bulge, indicating that the apical loop and the bulge act largely as independent dynamical recognition centers. The apical loop undergoes complex dynamics at multiple timescales that are likely important for adaptive recognition: U31 and G33 undergo limited motions, G32 is highly flexible at picosecond-nanosecond timescales, and G34 and C30 form a dynamic Watson-Crick basepair in which G34 and A35 undergo a slow (approximately 30 mus) likely concerted looping in and out motion, with A35 also undergoing large amplitude motions at picosecond-nanosecond timescales. Our study highlights the power of combining NMR, molecular dynamics, and mutagenesis in characterizing RNA dynamics.",

These dynamics accompany and guide, for example, RNA cotranscriptional folding, ligand sensing and signaling, site-specific catalysis in ribozymes, and the hierarchically ordered assembly of ribonucleoproteins. RNA dynamics are encoded by both the inherent properties of RNA structure, spanning many motional modes with a large range of amplitudes and timescales, and external trigger factors, ranging from proteins, nucleic acids, metal ions, metabolites, and vitamins to temperature and even directional RNA biosynthesis itself. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of RNA dynamics as highlighted by biophysical tools.",

        "Abstract": "RNAs fold into three-dimensional (3D) structures that subsequently undergo large, functionally important, conformational transitions in response to a variety of cellular signals. RNA structures are believed to encode spatially tuned flexibility that can direct transitions along specific conformational pathways. However, this hypothesis has proved difficult to examine directly because atomic movements in complex biomolecules cannot be visualized in 3D by using current experimental methods. Here we report the successful implementation of a strategy using NMR that has allowed us to visualize, with complete 3D rotational sensitivity, the dynamics between two RNA helices that are linked by a functionally important trinucleotide bulge over timescales extending up to milliseconds. The key to our approach is to anchor NMR frames of reference onto each helix and thereby directly measure their dynamics, one relative to the other, using 'relativistic' sets of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). Using this approach, we uncovered super-large amplitude helix motions that trace out a surprisingly structured and spatially correlated 3D dynamic trajectory. The two helices twist around their individual axes by approximately 53 degrees and 110 degrees in a highly correlated manner (R = 0.97) while simultaneously (R = 0.81-0.92) bending by about 94 degrees. Remarkably, the 3D dynamic trajectory is dotted at various positions by seven distinct ligand-bound conformations of the RNA. Thus even partly unstructured RNAs can undergo structured dynamics that directs ligand-induced transitions along specific predefined conformational pathways.",

        "Abstract": "We present an NMR strategy for characterizing picosecond-to-nanosecond internal motions in uniformly 13C/15N-labeled RNAs that combines measurements of R1, R1rho, and heteronuclear 13C{1H} NOEs for protonated base (C2, C5, C6, and C8) and sugar (C1') carbons with a domain elongation strategy for decoupling internal from overall motions and residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements for determining the average RNA global conformation and orientation of the principal axis of the axially symmetric rotational diffusion. TROSY-detected pulse sequences are presented for the accurate measurement of nucleobase carbon R1 and R1rho rates in large RNAs. The relaxation data is analyzed using a model free formalism which takes into account the very high anisotropy of overall rotational diffusion (Dratio approximately 4.7), asymmetry of the nucleobase CSAs and noncollinearity of C-C, C-H dipolar and CSA interactions under the assumption that all interaction tensors for a given carbon experience identical isotropic internal motions. The approach is demonstrated and validated on an elongated HIV-1 TAR RNA (taum approximately 18 ns) both in free form and bound to the ligand argininamide (ARG). Results show that, while ARG binding reduces the amplitude of collective helix motions and local mobility at the binding pocket, it leads to a drastic increase in the local mobility of \"spacer\" bulge residues linking the two helices which undergo virtually unrestricted internal motions (S2 approximately 0.2) in the ARG bound state. Our results establish the ability to quantitatively study the dynamics of RNAs which are significantly larger and more anisotropic than customarily studied by NMR carbon relaxation.",

Non-terminal Watson-Crick base pairs in helical stems are experimentally identified using NOE and trans-hydrogen bond connectivity and modeled using the idealized A-form helix geometry. RDCs measured in the partially aligned RNA are used to compute order tensors describing average alignment of each helix relative to the applied magnetic field. The order tensors are translated into Euler angles defining the average relative orientation of helices and order parameters describing the amplitude and asymmetry of interhelix motions. The protocol does not require complete resonance assignments and therefore can be implemented rapidly to RNAs much larger than those for which complete high-resolution NMR structure determination is feasible. The protocol is particularly valuable for exploring adaptive changes in RNA conformation that occur in response to biologically relevant signals. Following resonance assignments, the procedure is expected to take no more than 2 weeks of acquisition and data analysis time.",

        "Abstract": "Many regulatory RNAs undergo large changes in structure upon recognition of proteins and ligands, but the mechanism by which this occurs remains poorly understood. Using NMR residual dipolar coupling (RDCs), we characterized Na+-induced changes in the structure and dynamics of the bulge-containing HIV-1 transactivation response element (TAR) RNA that mirrors changes induced by small molecules bearing a different number of cationic groups. Increasing the Na+ concentration from 25 to 320 mM led to a continuous reduction in the average inter-helical bend angle (from 46 degrees to 22 degrees ), inter-helical twist angle (from 66 degrees to -18 degrees ), and inter-helix flexibility (as measured by an increase in the internal generalized degree of order from 0.56 to 0.74). Similar conformational changes were observed with Mg2+, indicating that nonspecific electrostatic interactions drive the conformational transition, although results also suggest that Na+ and Mg2+ may associate with TAR in distinct modes. The transition can be rationalized on the basis of a population-weighted average of two ensembles comprising an electrostatically relaxed bent and flexible TAR conformation that is weakly associated with counterions and a globally rigid coaxial conformation that has stronger electrostatic potential and association with counterions. The TAR inter-helical orientations that are stabilized by small molecules fall around the metal-induced conformational pathway, indicating that counterions may help predispose the TAR conformation for target recognition. Our results underscore the intricate sensitivity of RNA conformational dynamics to environmental conditions and demonstrate the ability to detect subtle conformational changes using NMR RDCs.",

        "Abstract": "The HIV-1 transactivation response RNA element (TAR), which is essential to the lifecycle of the virus, has been suggested, based on NMR and hydrodynamic measurements, to undergo substantial, collective, structural dynamics that are important for its function. To deal with the significant coupling between overall diffusional rotation and internal motion expected to exist in TAR, here we utilize an isotropic reorientational eigenmode dynamics analysis of simulated molecular trajectories to obtain a detailed description of TAR dynamics and an accurately quantified pattern of dynamical correlations. The analysis demonstrates the inseparability of internal and overall motional modes, confirms the existence and reveals the nature of collective domain dynamics, and additionally reveals that the hinge for these motions is centered on residues U23, C24, and C41. Results also indicate the existence of long-range communication between the loop and the core of the RNA, and between the loop and the bulge. Additionally, the isotropic reorientational eigenmode dynamics analysis explains, from a dynamical perspective, several existing biochemical mutational studies and suggests new mutations for future structural dynamics studies.",

        "Abstract": "Stem loop 1 (SL1) is a highly conserved hairpin in the 5'-leader of the human immunodeficiency virus type I that forms a metastable kissing dimer that is converted during viral maturation into a stable duplex with the aid of the nucleocapsid (NC) protein. SL1 contains a highly conserved internal loop that promotes the kissing-duplex transition by a mechanism that remains poorly understood. Using NMR, we characterized internal motions induced by the internal loop in an SL1 monomer that may promote the kissing-duplex transition. This includes micro-to-millisecond secondary structural transitions that cause partial melting of three base-pairs above the internal loop making them key nucleation sites for exchanging strands and nanosecond rigid-body stem motions that can help bring strands into spatial register. We show that while Mg2+ binds to the internal loop and arrests these internal motions, it preserves and/or activates local mobility at internal loop residues G272 and G273 which are implicated in NC binding. By stabilizing SL1 without compromising the accessibility of G272 and G273 for NC binding, Mg2+ may increase the dependence of the kissing-duplex transition on NC binding thus preventing spontaneous transitions from taking place and ensuring that viral RNA and protein maturation occur in concert.",

        "Abstract": "The P4 helix is an essential element of ribonuclease P (RNase P) that is believed to bind catalytically important metals. Here, we applied a combination of NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and a recently introduced domain-elongation strategy for measuring \"motionally decoupled\" relaxation data to characterize the structural dynamics of the P4 helix from Bacillus subtilis RNase P. In the absence of divalent ions, the two P4 helical domains undergo small amplitude (approximately 13 degrees) collective motions about an average interhelical angle of 10 degrees. The highly conserved U7 bulge and helical residue C8, which are proposed to be important for substrate recognition and metal binding, are locally mobile at pico- to nanosecond timescales and together form the pivot point for the collective domain motions. Chemical shift mapping reveals significant association of Mg2+ ions at the P4 major groove near the flexible pivot point at residues (A5, G22, G23) previously identified to bind catalytically important metals. The Mg2+ ions do not, however, significantly alter the structure or dynamics of P4. Analysis of results in the context of available X-ray structures of the RNA component of RNase P and structural models that include the pre-tRNA substrate suggest that the internal motions observed in P4 likely facilitate adaptive changes in conformation that take place during folding and substrate recognition, possibly aided by interactions with Mg2+ ions. Our results add to a growing view supporting the existence of functionally important internal motions in RNA occurring at nanosecond timescales.",

        "Abstract": "We examined how static and dynamic deviations from the idealized A-form helix propagate into errors in the principal order tensor parameters determined using residual dipolar couplings (rdcs). A 20-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the HIV-1 transactivation response element (TAR) RNA together with a survey of spin relaxation studies of RNA dynamics reveals that pico-to-nanosecond local motions in non-terminal Watson-Crick base-pairs will uniformly attenuate base and sugar one bond rdcs by approximately 7%. Gaussian distributions were generated for base and sugar torsion angles through statistical comparison of 40 RNA X-ray structures solved to <3.0 A resolution. For a typical number (>or=11) of one bond C-H base and sugar rdcs, these structural deviations together with rdc uncertainty (1.5 Hz) lead to average errors in the magnitude and orientation of the principal axis of order that are <9% and <4 degrees, respectively. The errors decrease to <5% and <4 degrees for >or=17 rdcs. A protocol that allows for estimation of error in A-form order tensors due to both angular deviations and rdc uncertainty (Aform-RDC) is validated using theoretical simulations and used to analyze rdcs measured previously in TAR in the free state and bound to four distinct ligands. Results confirm earlier findings that the two TAR helices undergo large changes in both their mean relative orientation and dynamics upon binding to different targets.",

This allowed us to site-specifically resolve a manifold of motional modes in two regulatory RNAs from HIV-1 with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance spin relaxation methods.

Pivot points are short, functionally important, and highly mobile internal loops.

The differences between the measured RCSAs and the values back-calculated using three nucleobase carbon CSA sets [D. Stueber, D.M. Grant, 13C and 15N chemical shift tensors in adenosine, guanosine dihydrate, 2'-deoxythymidine, and cytidine, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124 (2002) 10539-10551; D. Sitkoff, D.A.

NMR 16 (2000) 291-302] reported previously for mononucleotides (1.4 Hz) is significantly smaller than the predicted RCSA range (-10-10 Hz) but remains larger than the RCSA measurement uncertainty (0.8 Hz). Fitting of the traceless principal CSA values to the measured RCSAs using a grid search procedure yields a cytosine C5 CSA magnitude (CSAa=(3/2.(delta11(2)+delta22(2)+delta33(2)))1/2=173+/-21 ppm), which is significantly higher than the reported mononucleotide values (131-138 ppm) and a guanine C8 CSAa (148+/-13 ppm) that is in very good agreement with the mononucleotide value reported by solid-state NMR [134 ppm, D.

        "Title": "Modulating protein structure with fluorous amino acids: increased stability and native-like structure conferred on a 4-helix bundle protein by hexafluoroleucine.",
        "Abstract": "There has recently been much interest in exploiting the unusual properties associated with fluorocarbons to modulate the physicochemical properties of proteins. Here we present a detailed investigation into the effect on structure and stability of systematically repacking the hydrophobic core of a model protein with the extensively fluorinated (fluorous) amino acid l-5,5,5,5',5',5'-hexafluoroleucine (hFLeu). The starting point was a 27-residue peptide, alpha(4)-H, that adopts an antiparallel 4-alpha-helix bundle structure, and in which the hydrophobic core comprises six layers of leucine residues introduced at the \"a\" and \"d\" positions of the canonical heptad repeat. A series of peptides were synthesized in which the central two (alpha(4)-F(2))(,) four (alpha(4)-F(4)), or all six layers (alpha(4)-F(6)) of the core were substituted hFLeu. The free energy of unfolding increases by 0.3 (kcal/mol)/hFLeu on repacking the central two layers and by an additional 0.12 (kcal/mol)/hFLeu on repacking additional layers, so that alpha(4)-F(6) is approximately 25% more stable than the nonfluorinated protein alpha(4)-H. One-dimensional proton, two-dimensional (1)H-(15)N HSQC, and (19)F NMR spectroscopies were used to examine the effect of fluorination on the conformational dynamics of the peptide. Unexpectedly, increasing the degree of fluorination also appears to result in peptides that possess a more structured backbone and less fluid hydrophobic core. The latter only occurs in alpha(4)-F(4) and alpha(4)-F(6), suggesting that crowding of the hFLeu residues may restrict the amplitude and/or time scales for rotation of the side chains.",

I examine pathways for achieving selectivity in these conformational changes that rely to different extents on the structure and dynamics of RNA. Finally, I review solution-state NMR techniques that can be used to characterize RNA structural dynamics and its relationship to function.",

        "Title": "Argininamide binding arrests global motions in HIV-1 TAR RNA: comparison with Mg2+-induced conformational stabilization.",
        "Abstract": "The structure and dynamics of the stem-loop transactivation response element (TAR) RNA from the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) bound to the ligand argininamide (ARG) has been characterized using a combination of a large number of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and trans-hydrogen bond NMR methodology. Binding of ARG to TAR changes the average inter-helical angle between the two stems from approximately 47 degrees in the free state to approximately 11 degrees in the bound state, and leads to the arrest of large amplitude (+/-46 degrees ) inter-helical motions observed previously in the free state. While the global structural dynamics of TAR-ARG is similar to that previously reported for TAR bound to Mg2+, there are substantial differences in the hydrogen bond alignment of bulge and neighboring residues. Based on a novel H5(C5)NN experiment for probing hydrogen-mediated 2hJ(N,N) scalar couplings as well as measured RDCs, the TAR-ARG complex is stabilized by a U38-A27.U23 base-triple involving an A27.U23 reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bond alignment as well as by a A22-U40 Watson-Crick base-pair at the junction of stem I. These hydrogen bond alignments are not observed in either the free or Mg2+ bound forms of TAR. The combined conformational analysis of TAR under three states reveals that ligands and divalent ions can stabilize similar RNA global conformations through distinct interactions involving different hydrogen bond alignments in the RNA.",

        "Abstract": "Approaches developed thus for extracting structural and dynamical information from RDCs have rested on the assumption that motions do not affect molecular alignment. However, it is well established that molecular alignment in ordered media is dependent on conformation, and slowly interconverting conformational substates may exhibit different alignment properties. Neglecting these correlation effects can lead to aberrations in the structural and dynamical analysis of RDCs and diminish the utility of RDCs in probing motions between domains having similar alignment propensities. Here, we introduce a new approach based on measurement of magnetic field induced residual dipolar couplings in nucleic acids which can explicitly take into account such correlations and demonstrate measurements of motions between two \"magnetically equivalent\" domains in the transactivation response element (TAR) RNA.",

Order matrix analysis of one bond 13C-1H RDCs measured in TAR at [Mg(2+)]:[TAR] stoichiometric ratios of approximately 3:1 (TAR(3.0Mg)) and approximately 4.5:1 (TAR(4.5Mg)) revealed that Mg(2+) reduces the average inter-helical angle from 47(+/-5) degrees in TAR(free) to 5(+/-7) degrees in TAR(4.5Mg). In contrast to the TAR(free) state, the generalized degree of order for the two stems in TAR(4.5Mg) is found to be identical within experimental uncertainty, indicating that binding of Mg(2+) leads to an arrest of inter-helical motions in TAR(free). Results demonstrate that RDC-NMR methodology can provide new insight into the effects of Mg(2+) on both the conformation and dynamics of RNA.",

        "Abstract": "The U.S. Department of Energy recently announced the first five grants for the Genomes to Life (GTL) Program. The goal of this program is to \"achieve the most far-reaching of all biological goals: a fundamental, comprehensive, and systematic understanding of life.\" While more information about the program can be found at the GTL website (www.doegenomestolife.org), this paper provides an overview of one of the five GTL projects funded, \"Carbon Sequestration in Synechococcus Sp.: From Molecular Machines to Hierarchical Modeling.\" This project is a combined experimental and computational effort emphasizing developing, prototyping, and applying new computational tools and methods to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of the carbon sequestration of Synechococcus Sp., an abundant marine cyanobacteria known to play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Understanding, predicting, and perhaps manipulating carbon fixation in the oceans has long been a major focus of biological oceanography and has more recently been of interest to a broader audience of scientists and policy makers. It is clear that the oceanic sinks and sources of CO(2) are important terms in the global environmental response to anthropogenic atmospheric inputs of CO(2) and that oceanic microorganisms play a key role in this response. However, the relationship between this global phenomenon and the biochemical mechanisms of carbon fixation in these microorganisms is poorly understood. The project includes five subprojects: an experimental investigation, three computational biology efforts, and a fifth which deals with addressing computational infrastructure challenges of relevance to this project and the Genomes to Life program as a whole. Our experimental effort is designed to provide biology and data to drive the computational efforts and includes significant investment in developing new experimental methods for uncovering protein partners, characterizing protein complexes, identifying new binding domains. We will also develop and apply new data measurement and statistical methods for analyzing microarray experiments. Our computational efforts include coupling molecular simulation methods with knowledge discovery from diverse biological data sets for high-throughput discovery and characterization of protein-protein complexes and developing a set of novel capabilities for inference of regulatory pathways in microbial genomes across multiple sources of information through the integration of computational and experimental technologies. These capabilities will be applied to Synechococcus regulatory pathways to characterize their interaction map and identify component proteins in these pathways. We will also investigate methods for combining experimental and computational results with visualization and natural language tools to accelerate discovery of regulatory pathways. Furthermore, given that the ultimate goal of this effort is to develop a systems-level of understanding of how the Synechococcus genome affects carbon fixation at the global scale, we will develop and apply a set of tools for capturing the carbon fixation behavior of complex of Synechococcus at different levels of resolution. Finally, because the explosion of data being produced by high-throughput experiments requires data analysis and models which are more computationally complex, more heterogeneous, and require coupling to ever increasing amounts of experimentally obtained data in varying formats, we have also established a companion computational infrastructure to support this effort as well as the Genomes to Life program as a whole.",

        "Abstract": "We report a new residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) based NMR procedure for rapidly determining RNA tertiary structure demonstrated on a uniformly (15)N/(13)C-labeled 27 nt variant of the trans-activation response element (TAR) RNA from HIV-I. In this procedure, the time-consuming nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE)-based sequential assignment step is replaced by a fully automated RDC-based assignment strategy. This approach involves examination of all allowed sequence-specific resonance assignment permutations for best-fit agreement between measured RDCs and coordinates for sub-structures in a target RNA. Using idealized A-form geometries to model Watson-Crick helices and coordinates from a previous X-ray structure to model a hairpin loop in TAR, the best-fit RDC assignment solutions are determined very rapidly (<five minutes of computational time) and are in complete agreement with corresponding NOE-based assignments. Orientational constraints derived from RDCs are used simultaneously to assemble sub-structures into an RNA tertiary conformation. Through enhanced speeds of application and reduced reliance on chemical shift dispersion, this RDC-based approach lays the foundation for rapidly determining RNA conformations in a structural genomics context, and may increase the size limit of RNAs that can be examined by NMR.",

        "Title": "Residual dipolar couplings: synergy between NMR and structural genomics.",
        "Abstract": "Structural genomics is on a quest for the structure and function of a significant fraction of gene products. Current efforts are focusing on structure determination of single-domain proteins, which can readily be targeted by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and computational homology modeling. However, comprehensive association of gene products with functions also requires systematic determination of more complex protein structures and other biomolecules participating in cellular processes such as nucleic acids, and characterization of biomolecular interactions and dynamics relevant to function. Such NMR investigations are becoming more feasible, not only due to recent advances in NMR methodology, but also because structural genomics is providing valuable structural information and new experimental and computational tools. The measurement of residual dipolar couplings in partially oriented systems and other new NMR methods will play an important role in this synergistic relationship between NMR and structural genomics. Both an expansion in the domain of NMR application, and important contributions to future structural genomics efforts can be anticipated.",

        "Abstract": "Ground-state dynamics in RNA is a critical precursor for structural adaptation observed ubiquitously in protein-RNA recognition. A tertiary conformational analysis of the stem-loop structural element in the transactivation response element (TAR) from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-I) RNA is presented using recently introduced NMR methods that rely on the measurement of residual dipolar couplings (RDC) in partially oriented systems. Order matrix analysis of RDC data provides evidence for inter-helical motions that are of amplitude 46(+/-4) degrees, of random directional character, and that are executed about an average conformation with an inter-helical angle between 44 degrees and 54 degrees. The generated ensemble of TAR conformations have different organizations of functional groups responsible for interaction with the trans-activator protein Tat, including conformations similar to the previously characterized bound-state conformation. These results demonstrate the utility of RDC-NMR for simultaneously characterizing RNA tertiary dynamics and average conformation, and indicate an avenue for TAR complex formation involving tertiary structure capture.",
