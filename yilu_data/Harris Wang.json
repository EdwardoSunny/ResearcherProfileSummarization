        "Abstract": "The incidence of Barrett esophagus (BE) and Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma (GEAC) correlates with obesity and a diet rich in fat. Bile acids (BA) support fat digestion and undergo microbial metabolization in the gut. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is an important modulator of the BA homeostasis. The capacity of inhibiting cancer-related processes when activated, make FXR an appealing therapeutic target. In this work, we assess the role of diet on the microbiota-BA axis and evaluate the role of FXR in disease progression.",

The design of functional overlapping gene pairs is a challenging procedure, and computational design tools are used to improve the efficiency to deploy successful designs in genetically engineered systems. GENTANGLE (Gene Tuples ArraNGed in overLapping Elements) is a high-performance containerized pipeline for the computational design of two overlapping genes translated in different reading frames of the genome. This new software package can be used to design and test gene entanglements for microbial engineering projects using arbitrary sets of user-specified gene pairs.",

        "Abstract": "As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and mutate, tracking the viral evolutionary trajectory and understanding the functional consequences of its mutations remain crucial. Here, we characterized the antibody evasion, ACE2 receptor engagement, and viral infectivity of the highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariant BA.2.87.1. Compared with other Omicron subvariants, including EG.5.1 and the current predominant JN.1, BA.2.87.1 exhibits less immune evasion, reduced viral receptor engagement, and comparable infectivity in Calu-3 lung cells. Intriguingly, two large deletions (\u039415-26 and \u0394136-146) in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein facilitate subtly increased antibody evasion but significantly diminish viral infectivity. Collectively, our data support the announcement by the USA CDC that the public health risk posed by BA.2.87.1 appears to be low.",

We examined whether the stool proteome of mouse models of gastric cancer (GC) and individuals with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) have utility as biomarkers for early detection. Proteomic mass spectrometry of the stool of a genetically engineered mouse model driven by oncogenic KrasG12D and loss of p53 and Cdh1 in gastric parietal cells [known as Triple Conditional (TCON) mice] identified differentially abundant proteins compared with littermate controls. Immunoblot assays validated a panel of proteins, including actinin alpha 4 (ACTN4), N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 2 (ASAH2), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and valosin-containing protein (VCP), as enriched in TCON stool compared with littermate control stool. Immunofluorescence analysis of these proteins in TCON stomach sections revealed increased protein expression compared with littermate controls. Proteomic mass spectrometry of stool obtained from patients with HDGC with CDH1 mutations identified increased expression of ASAH2, DPP4, VCP, lactotransferrin (LTF), and tropomyosin-2 relative to stool from healthy sex- and age-matched donors. Chemical inhibition of ASAH2 using C6 urea ceramide was toxic to GC cell lines and GC patient-derived organoids. This toxicity was reversed by adding downstream products of the S1P synthesis pathway, which suggested a dependency on ASAH2 activity in GC. An exploratory analysis of the HDGC stool microbiome identified features that correlated with patient tumors. Herein, we provide evidence supporting the potential of analyzing stool biomarkers for the early detection of DGC. Prevention Relevance: This study highlights a novel panel of stool protein biomarkers that correlate with the presence of DGC and has potential use as early detection to improve clinical outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Many drugs can perturb the gut microbiome, potentially leading to negative health consequences. However, mechanisms of most microorganism-drug responses have not been elucidated at the genetic level. Using high-throughput bacterial transcriptomics, we systematically characterized the gene expression profiles of prevalent human gut bacteria exposed to the most frequently prescribed orally administered pharmaceuticals. Across >400 drug-microorganism pairs, significant and reproducible transcriptional responses were observed, including pathways involved in multidrug resistance, metabolite transport, tartrate metabolism and riboflavin biosynthesis. Importantly, we discovered that statin-mediated upregulation of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in Bacteroidales species enhances microbial sensitivity to vitamin A and secondary bile acids. Moreover, gut bacteria carrying acrAB-tolC genes are depleted in patients taking simvastatin, suggesting that drug-efflux interactions generate collateral toxicity that depletes pump-containing microorganisms from patient microbiomes. This study provides a resource to further understand the drivers of drug-mediated microbiota shifts for better informed clinical interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated transposases have the potential to transform the technology landscape for kilobase-scale genome engineering, by virtue of their ability to integrate large genetic payloads with high accuracy, easy programmability and no requirement for homologous recombination machinery. These transposons encode efficient, CRISPR RNA-guided transposases that execute genomic insertions in Escherichia coli at efficiencies approaching ~100%. Moreover, they generate multiplexed edits when programmed with multiple guides, and function robustly in diverse Gram-negative bacterial species. Here we present a detailed protocol for engineering bacterial genomes using CRISPR-associated transposase (CAST) systems, including guidelines on the available vectors, customization of guide RNAs and DNA payloads, selection of common delivery methods, and genotypic analysis of integration events. We further describe a computational CRISPR RNA design algorithm to avoid potential off-targets, and a CRISPR array cloning pipeline for performing multiplexed DNA insertions. The method presented here allows the isolation of clonal strains containing a novel genomic integration event of interest within 1-2 weeks using available plasmid constructs and standard molecular biology techniques.",

        "Abstract": "Efficient methods for the generation of specific mutations enable the study of functional variations in natural populations and lead to advances in genetic engineering applications. Here, we present a new approach, mutagenesis by template-guided amplicon assembly (MEGAA), for the rapid construction of kilobase-sized DNA variants. With this method, many mutations can be generated at a time to a DNA template at more than 90% efficiency per target in a predictable manner. We devised a robust and iterative protocol for an open-source laboratory automation robot that enables desktop production and long-read sequencing validation of variants. Using this system, we demonstrated the construction of 31 natural SARS-CoV2 spike gene variants and 10 recoded Escherichia coli genome fragments, with each 4\u2009kb region containing up to 150 mutations. Furthermore, 125 defined combinatorial adeno-associated virus-2 cap gene variants were easily built using the system, which exhibited viral packaging enhancements of up to 10-fold compared with wild type. Thus, the MEGAA platform enables generation of multi-site sequence variants quickly, cheaply, and in a scalable manner for diverse applications in biotechnology.",

Here we describe an open-source high-throughput robotic strain isolation platform for the rapid generation of isolates on demand. We develop a machine learning approach that leverages colony morphology and genomic data to maximize the diversity of microbes isolated and enable targeted picking of specific genera. Application of this platform on fecal samples from 20 humans yields personalized gut microbiome biobanks totaling 26,997 isolates that represented >80% of all abundant taxa. Spatial analysis on >100,000 visually captured colonies reveals cogrowth patterns between Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Coriobacteriaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae families that suggest important microbial interactions. Comparative analysis of 1,197 high-quality genomes from these biobanks shows interesting intra- and interpersonal strain evolution, selection and horizontal gene transfer. This culturomics framework should empower new research efforts to systematize the collection and quantitative analysis of imaging-based phenotypes with high-resolution genomics data for many emerging microbiome studies.",

Here, we report that neutralization of BQ.1, BQ.1.1, XBB, and XBB.1 by sera from vaccinees and infected persons was markedly impaired, including sera from individuals boosted with a WA1/BA.5 bivalent mRNA vaccine. Titers against BQ and XBB subvariants were lower by 13- to 81-fold and 66- to 155-fold, respectively, far beyond what had been observed to date. Monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing the original Omicron variant were largely inactive against these new subvariants, and the responsible individual spike mutations were identified. These subvariants were found to have similar ACE2-binding affinities as their predecessors. Together, our findings indicate that BQ and XBB subvariants present serious threats to current COVID-19 vaccines, render inactive all authorized antibodies, and may have gained dominance in the population because of their advantage in evading antibodies.",

While gut microbes have been extensively studied over the past decades, little is known about the proteins that they secrete into the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we developed and applied a computational pipeline to a comprehensive catalog of human-associated metagenome-assembled genomes in order to predict and analyze the bacterial metasecretome of the human gut, i.e., the collection of proteins secreted out of the cytoplasm by human gut bacteria. We identified the presence of large and diverse families of secreted carbohydrate-active enzymes and assessed their phylogenetic distributions across different taxonomic groups, which revealed an enrichment in ",

        "Abstract": "Major genomic deletions in independent eukaryotic lineages have led to repeated ancestral loss of biosynthesis pathways for nine of the twenty canonical amino acids. While the evolutionary forces driving these polyphyletic deletion events are not well understood, the consequence is that extant metazoans are unable to produce nine essential amino acids (EAAs). Previous studies have highlighted that EAA biosynthesis tends to be more energetically costly, raising the possibility that these pathways were lost from organisms with access to abundant EAAs. It is unclear whether present-day metazoans can reaccept these pathways to resurrect biosynthetic capabilities that were lost long ago or whether evolution has rendered EAA pathways incompatible with metazoan metabolism. Here, we report progress on a large-scale synthetic genomics effort to reestablish EAA biosynthetic functionality in mammalian cells. We designed codon-optimized biosynthesis pathways based on genes mined from ",

We show that intestinal microbiota protects against development of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and pre-diabetic phenotypes by inducing commensal-specific Th17 cells. High-fat, high-sugar diet promoted metabolic disease by depleting Th17-inducing microbes, and recovery of commensal Th17 cells restored protection. Microbiota-induced Th17 cells afforded protection by regulating lipid absorption across intestinal epithelium in an IL-17-dependent manner. Diet-induced loss of protective Th17 cells was mediated by the presence of sugar. Eliminating sugar from high-fat diets protected mice from obesity and metabolic syndrome in a manner dependent on commensal-specific Th17 cells. Sugar and ILC3 promoted outgrowth of Faecalibaculum rodentium that displaced Th17-inducing microbiota. These results define dietary and microbiota factors posing risk for metabolic syndrome. They also define a microbiota-dependent mechanism for immuno-pathogenicity of dietary sugar and highlight an elaborate interaction between diet, microbiota, and intestinal immunity in regulation of metabolic disorders.",

        "Abstract": "The recently reported B.1.1.529 Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) includes 34 mutations in the spike protein relative to the Wuhan strain, including 15 mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Functional studies have shown Omicron to substantially escape the activity of many SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies. Here, we report a 3.1\u00a0\u00c5-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Omicron spike protein ectodomain. The structure depicts a spike that is exclusively in the 1-RBD-up conformation with high mobility of RBD. Many mutations cause steric clashes and/or altered interactions at antibody-binding surfaces, whereas others mediate changes of the spike structure in local regions to interfere with antibody recognition. Overall, the structure of the Omicron spike reveals how mutations alter its conformation and explains its extraordinary ability to evade neutralizing antibodies.",

However, few engineered living materials are capable of both responsivity and use in macroscopic structures. Here we describe the development, characterization and engineering of a fungal-bacterial biocomposite grown on lignocellulosic feedstocks that can form mouldable, foldable and regenerative living structures. We have developed strategies to make human-scale biocomposite structures using mould-based and origami-inspired growth and assembly paradigms. Microbiome profiling of the biocomposite over multiple generations enabled the identification of a dominant bacterial component, Pantoea agglomerans, which was further isolated and developed into a new chassis. We introduced engineered P. agglomerans into native feedstocks to yield living blocks with new biosynthetic and sensing-reporting capabilities. Bioprospecting the native microbiota to develop engineerable chassis constitutes an important strategy to facilitate the development of living biomaterials with new properties and functionalities.",

        "Abstract": "Microbial communities are a key part to tackling global challenges in human health, environmental conservation, and sustainable agriculture in the coming decade. Recent advances in synthetic biology to study and modify microbial communities have led to important insights into their physiology and ecology. Understanding how targeted changes to microbial communities result in reproducible alterations of the community's intrinsic fluctuations and function is important for mechanistic reconstruction of microbiomes. Studies of synthetic microbial consortia and comparative analysis of communities in normal and disrupted states have revealed ecological principles that can be leveraged to engineer communities towards desired functions. Tools enabling temporal modulation and sensing of the community dynamics offer precise spatiotemporal control of functions, help to dissect microbial interaction networks, and improve predictions of population temporal dynamics. Here we discuss recent advances to manipulate microbiome dynamics through control of specific strain engraftment and abundance, modulation of cell-cell signaling for tuning population dynamics, infiltration of new functions in the existing community with in situ engineering, and in silico modeling of microbial consortia to predict community function and ecology.",

        "Abstract": "Protein serine/threonine/tyrosine (S/T/Y) phosphorylation is an essential and frequent post-translational modification in eukaryotes, but historically has been considered less prevalent in bacteria because fewer proteins were found to be phosphorylated and most proteins were modified to a lower degree. Recent proteomics studies greatly expanded the phosphoproteome of Escherichia coli to more than 2000 phosphorylation sites (phosphosites), yet mechanisms of action were proposed for only six phosphosites and fitness effects were described for 38 phosphosites upon perturbation. By systematically characterizing functional relevance of S/T/Y phosphorylation in E. coli metabolism, we found 44 of the 52 mutated phosphosites to be functional based on growth phenotypes and intracellular metabolome profiles. By effectively doubling the number of known functional phosphosites, we provide evidence that protein phosphorylation is a major regulation process in bacterial metabolism. Combining in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrate how single phosphosites modulate enzymatic activity and regulate metabolic fluxes in glycolysis, methylglyoxal bypass, acetate metabolism and the split between pentose phosphate and Entner-Doudoroff pathways through mechanisms that include shielding the substrate binding site, limiting structural dynamics, and disrupting interactions relevant for activity in vivo.",

Here we highlight key mechanisms of interspecies antagonism that rely on direct cell-to-cell contact or diffusion of secreted biomolecules, and discuss recent advances to provide altered function and specificities for microbiome engineering. We further outline the use of ecological design principles based on antagonistic interactions for bottom-up assembly of synthetic microbial communities. Manipulating microbial communities through these negative interactions will be critical for understanding complex microbiome processes and properties and developing new applications of microbiome engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Recent efforts to sequence, survey, and functionally characterize the diverse biosynthetic capabilities of bacteria have identified numerous Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs). Genes found within BGCs are typically transcriptionally silent, suggesting their expression is tightly regulated. To better elucidate the underlying mechanisms and principles that govern BGC regulation on a DNA sequence level, we employed high-throughput DNA synthesis and multiplexed reporter assays to build and to characterize a library of BGC-derived regulatory sequences. Regulatory sequence transcription levels were measured in the Actinobacteria ",

        "Abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) is a Gram-negative oral commensal, prevalent in various human diseases. It is unknown how this common commensal converts to a rampant pathogen. We report that Fn secretes an adhesin (FadA) with amyloid properties via a Fap2-like autotransporter to enhance its virulence. The extracellular FadA binds Congo Red, Thioflavin-T, and antibodies raised against human amyloid \u03b242. Fn produces amyloid-like FadA under stress and disease conditions, but not in healthy sites or tissues. It functions as a scaffold for biofilm formation, confers acid tolerance, and mediates Fn binding to host cells. Furthermore, amyloid-like FadA induces periodontal bone loss and promotes CRC progression in mice, with virulence attenuated by amyloid-binding compounds. The uncleaved signal peptide of FadA is required for the formation and stability of mature amyloid FadA fibrils. We propose a model in which hydrophobic signal peptides serve as \"hooks\" to crosslink neighboring FadA filaments to form a stable amyloid-like structure. Our study provides a potential mechanistic link between periodontal disease and CRC and suggests anti-amyloid therapies as possible interventions for Fn-mediated disease processes.",

        "Abstract": "DNA has been the predominant information storage medium for biology and holds great promise as a next-generation high-density data medium in the digital era. Currently, the vast majority of DNA-based data storage approaches rely on in vitro DNA synthesis. As such, there are limited methods to encode digital data into the chromosomes of living cells in a single step. Here, we describe a new electrogenetic framework for direct storage of digital data in living cells. Using an engineered redox-responsive CRISPR adaptation system, we encoded binary data in 3-bit units into CRISPR arrays of bacterial cells by electrical stimulation. We demonstrate multiplex data encoding into barcoded cell populations to yield meaningful information storage and capacity up to 72\u2009bits, which can be maintained over many generations in natural open environments. This work establishes a direct digital-to-biological data storage framework and advances our capacity for information exchange between silicon- and carbon-based entities.",

To address these shortcomings, we introduce a substantially improved version of our previously reported Tn7-like transposon from Vibrio cholerae, which uses a Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system for programmable, RNA-guided transposition. The optimized insertion of transposable elements by guide RNA-assisted targeting (INTEGRATE) system achieves highly accurate and marker-free DNA integration of up to 10 kilobases at ~100% efficiency in bacteria. Using multi-spacer CRISPR arrays, we achieved simultaneous multiplexed insertions in three genomic loci and facile, multi-loci deletions by combining orthogonal integrases and recombinases. Finally, we demonstrated robust function in biomedically and industrially relevant bacteria and achieved target- and species-specific integration in a complex bacterial community. This work establishes INTEGRATE as a versatile tool for multiplexed, kilobase-scale genome engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Programmable gene activation enables fine-tuned regulation of endogenous and synthetic gene circuits to control cellular behavior. While CRISPR-Cas-mediated gene activation has been extensively developed for eukaryotic systems, similar strategies have been difficult to implement in bacteria. Here, we present a generalizable platform for screening and selection of functional bacterial CRISPR-Cas transcription activators. Using this platform, we identified a novel CRISPR activator, dCas9-AsiA, that could activate gene expression by more than 200-fold across genomic and plasmid targets with diverse promoters after directed evolution. The evolved dCas9-AsiA can simultaneously mediate activation and repression of bacterial regulons in E.\u00a0coli. We further identified hundreds of promoters with varying basal expression that could be induced by dCas9-AsiA, which provides a rich resource of genetic parts for inducible gene activation. Finally, we show that dCas9-AsiA can be ported to other bacteria of clinical and bioindustrial relevance, thus enabling bacterial CRISPRa in more application areas. This work expands the toolbox for programmable gene regulation in bacteria and provides a useful resource for future engineering of other bacterial CRISPR-based gene regulators.",

        "Abstract": "While horizontal gene transfer is prevalent across the biosphere, the regulatory features that enable expression and functionalization of foreign DNA remain poorly understood. Here, we combine high-throughput promoter activity measurements and large-scale genomic analysis of regulatory regions to investigate the cross-compatibility of regulatory elements (REs) in bacteria. Functional characterization of thousands of natural REs in three distinct bacterial species revealed distinct expression patterns according to RE and recipient phylogeny. Host capacity to activate foreign promoters was proportional to their genomic GC content, while many low GC regulatory elements were both broadly active and had more transcription start sites across hosts. The difference in expression capabilities could be explained by the influence of the host GC content on the stringency of the AT-rich canonical \u03c370 motif necessary for transcription initiation. We further confirm the generalizability of this model and find widespread GC content adaptation of the \u03c370 motif in a set of 1,545 genomes from all major bacterial phyla. Our analysis identifies a key mechanism by which the strength of the AT-rich \u03c370 motif relative to a host's genomic GC content governs the capacity for expression of acquired DNA. These findings shed light on regulatory adaptation in the context of evolving genomic composition.",

However, our knowledge about DNA transfer within complex microbiomes is lacking, with most studies of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) relying on bioinformatic analyses of genetic elements maintained on evolutionary timescales or experimental measurements of phenotypically trackable markers. Here, we utilize the CRISPR-Cas spacer acquisition process to detect DNA acquisition events from complex microbiota in real-time and at nucleotide resolution. In this system, an E. coli recording strain is exposed to a microbial sample and spacers are acquired from transferred plasmids and permanently stored in genomic CRISPR arrays. Sequencing and analysis\u00a0of acquired spacers enables identification of the transferred plasmids. This approach allowed us to identify individual mobile elements without relying on phenotypic markers or post-transfer replication. We found that HGT into the recording strain in human clinical fecal samples can be extensive and is driven by different plasmid types, with the IncX type being the most actively transferred.",

Cost-effective bacterial RNA-seq requires efficient physical removal of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which otherwise dominates transcriptomic reads. However, current methods to effectively deplete rRNA of diverse non-model bacterial species are lacking. Here, we describe a probe and ribonuclease based strategy for bacterial rRNA removal. We implemented the method using either chemically synthesized oligonucleotides or amplicon-based single-stranded DNA probes and validated the technique on three novel gut microbiota isolates from three distinct phyla. We further showed that different probe sets can be used on closely related species. We provide a detailed methods protocol, probe sets for >5000 common microbes from RefSeq, and an online tool to generate custom probe libraries. This approach lays the groundwork for large-scale and cost-effective bacterial transcriptomics studies.",

Recombinases that can integrate kilobase-sized DNA constructs are difficult to reprogram to user-defined loci, while genomic insertion using CRISPR-Cas methods relies on inefficient host DNA repair machinery. Here, we describe a Cas-Transposon (CasTn) system for genomic insertions that uses a Himar1 transposase fused to a catalytically dead dCas9 nuclease to mediate programmable, site-directed transposition.

        "Abstract": "Functional conservation is known to constrain protein evolution. Nevertheless, the long-term divergence patterns of proteins maintaining the same molecular function and the possible limits of this divergence have not been explored in detail. We investigate these fundamental questions by characterizing the divergence between ancient protein orthologs with conserved molecular function. Our results demonstrate that the decline of sequence and structural similarities between such orthologs significantly slows down after ~1-2 billion years of independent evolution. As a result, the sequence and structural similarities between ancient orthologs have not substantially decreased for the past billion years. The effective divergence limit (>25% sequence identity) is not primarily due to protein sites universally conserved in all linages. Instead, less than four amino acid types are accepted, on average, per site across orthologous protein sequences. Our analysis also reveals different divergence patterns for protein sites with experimentally determined small and large fitness effects of mutations.",

However, current throughput of cell-free measurements is limited by the use of channel-limited fluorescent readouts. Here, we describe DNA Regulatory element Analysis by cell-Free Transcription and Sequencing (DRAFTS), a rapid and robust in\u00a0vitro approach for multiplexed measurement of transcriptional activities from thousands of regulatory sequences in a single reaction. We employ this method in active cell lysates developed from ten diverse bacterial species. Interspecies analysis of transcriptional profiles from >\u00a01,000 diverse regulatory sequences reveals functional differences in promoter activity that can be quantitatively modeled, providing a rich resource for tuning gene expression in diverse bacterial species. Finally, we examine the transcriptional capacities of dual-species hybrid lysates that can simultaneously harness gene expression properties of multiple organisms. We expect that this cell-free multiplex transcriptional measurement approach will improve genetic part prototyping in new bacterial chassis for synthetic biology.",

We present a generalizable strategy to preserve and constrain genetic information through the computational design of overlapping genes. Overlapping a sequence with an essential gene altered its fitness landscape and produced a constrained evolutionary path, even for synonymous mutations. Embedding a toxin gene in a gene of interest restricted its horizontal propagation. We further demonstrated a multiplex and scalable approach to build and test >7500 overlapping sequence designs, yielding functional yet highly divergent variants from natural homologs. This work enables deeper exploration of natural and engineered overlapping genes and facilitates enhanced genetic stability and biocontainment in emerging applications.",

Here, we present decomposition of variance using replicate sampling (DIVERS), a method based on replicate sampling and spike-in sequencing. The method quantifies the contributions of temporal dynamics, spatial sampling variability, and technical noise to the variances and covariances of absolute bacterial abundances. We applied DIVERS to investigate a high-resolution time series of the human gut microbiome and a spatial survey of a soil bacterial community in Manhattan's Central Park. Our analysis showed that in the gut, technical noise dominated the abundance variability for nearly half of the detected taxa. DIVERS also revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity of gut microbiota, and high temporal covariances of taxa within the Bacteroidetes phylum. In the soil community, spatial variability primarily contributed to abundance fluctuations at short time scales (weeks), while temporal variability dominated at longer time scales (several months).",

        "Abstract": "Microbial gene regulatory networks are composed of cis- and trans-components that in concert act to control essential and adaptive cellular functions. Regulatory components and interactions evolve to adopt new configurations through mutations and network rewiring events, resulting in novel phenotypes that may benefit the cell. Advances in high-throughput DNA synthesis and sequencing have enabled the development of new tools and approaches to better characterize and perturb various elements of regulatory networks. Here, we highlight key recent approaches to systematically dissect the sequence space of cis-regulatory elements and trans-regulators as well as their inter-connections. These efforts yield fundamental insights into the architecture, robustness, and dynamics of gene regulation and provide models and design principles for building synthetic regulatory networks for a variety of practical applications.",

However, such data are often inaccessible or difficult to directly obtain. Less invasive, more robust and higher-throughput biological recording tools are needed to profile cells and their environments. DNA-based cellular recording is an emerging and powerful framework for tracking intracellular and extracellular biological events over time across living cells and populations. Here, we review and assess DNA recorders that utilize CRISPR nucleases, integrases and base-editing strategies, as well as recombinase and polymerase-based methods. Quantitative characterization, modelling and evaluation of these DNA-recording modalities can guide their design and implementation for specific application areas.",

Here we report the large-scale metagenomic mining of thousands of natural 5' regulatory sequences from diverse bacteria, and their multiplexed gene expression characterization in industrially relevant microbes. We identified sequences with broad and host-specific expression properties that are robust in various growth conditions. We also observed substantial differences between species in terms of their capacity to utilize exogenous regulatory sequences. Finally, we demonstrate programmable species-selective gene expression that produces distinct and diverse output patterns in different microbes. Together, these findings provide a rich resource of characterized natural regulatory sequences and a framework that can be used to engineer synthetic gene circuits with unique and tunable cross-species functionality and properties, and also suggest the prospect of ultimately engineering complex behaviors at the community level.",

Here we describe a framework for storing temporal biological information directly in the genomes of a cell population. We developed a \"biological tape recorder\" in which biological signals trigger intracellular DNA production that is then recorded by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system. This approach enables stable recording over multiple days and accurate reconstruction of temporal and lineage information by sequencing CRISPR arrays. We further demonstrate a multiplexing strategy to simultaneously record the temporal availability of three metabolites (copper, trehalose, and fucose) in the environment of a cell population over time. This work enables the temporal measurement of dynamic cellular states and environmental changes and suggests new applications for chronicling biological events on a large scale.",

        "Abstract": "Taxanes such as docetaxel belong to a group of microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) that are commonly relied upon to treat cancer. However, taxane resistance in cancerous cells drastically reduces the effectiveness of the drugs' long-term usage. Accumulated evidence suggests that the mechanisms underlying taxane resistance include both general mechanisms, such as the development of multidrug resistance due to the overexpression of drug-efflux proteins, and taxane-specific mechanisms, such as those that involve microtubule dynamics. Because taxanes target cell microtubules, measuring microtubule dynamic instability is an important step in determining the mechanisms of taxane resistance and provides insight into how to overcome this resistance. In the experiment, an in vivo method was used to measure microtubule dynamic instability. GFP-tagged \u03b1-tubulin was expressed and incorporated into microtubules in MCF-7 cells, allowing for the recording of the microtubule dynamics by time lapse using a sensitive camera. The results showed that, as opposed to the non-resistant parental MCF-7CC cells, the microtubule dynamics of docetaxel-resistant MCF-7TXT cells are insensitive to docetaxel treatment, which causes the resistance to docetaxel-induced mitotic arrest and apoptosis. This paper will outline this in vivo method of measuring microtubule dynamic instability.",

        "Abstract": "Synonymous codon choices at the beginning of genes optimize 5' RNA structures for enhanced translation initiation, but less is known about mechanisms that drive codon optimization downstream within the gene. To understand what determines codon choices across a gene, we generated 12,726 in\u00a0situ codon mutants in the Escherichia coli essential gene infA and measured their fitness by combining multiplex automated genome engineering mutagenesis with amplicon deep sequencing (MAGE-seq). Correlating predicted 5' RNA structure with fitness revealed that codons even far from the start of the gene are deleterious if they disrupt the native 5' RNA conformation. These long-range structural interactions generate context-dependent rules that constrain codon choices beyond intrinsic codon preferences. Genome-wide RNA folding predictions confirm that natural codon choices far from the start codon are optimized in part to prevent disruption of native structures near the 5' UTR. Our results shed light on natural codon distributions and should improve engineering of gene expression for synthetic biology applications.",

        "Abstract": "Comprehensive delineation of complex cellular networks requires high-throughput interrogation of genetic interactions. To address this challenge, we describe the development of a multiplex combinatorial strategy to assess pairwise genetic interactions using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and next-generation sequencing. We characterize the performance of combinatorial genome editing and analysis using different promoter and gRNA designs and identified regions of the chimeric RNA that are compatible with next-generation sequencing preparation and quantification. This approach is an important step towards elucidating genetic networks relevant to human diseases and the development of more efficient Cas9-based therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "The importance of microbial communities (MCs) cannot be overstated. MCs underpin the biogeochemical cycles of the earth's soil, oceans and the atmosphere, and perform ecosystem functions that impact plants, animals and humans. Yet our ability to predict and manage the function of these highly complex, dynamically changing communities is limited. Building predictive models that link MC composition to function is a key emerging challenge in microbial ecology. Here, we argue that addressing this challenge requires close coordination of experimental data collection and method development with mathematical model building. We discuss specific examples where model-experiment integration has already resulted in important insights into MC function and structure. We also highlight key research questions that still demand better integration of experiments and models. We argue that such integration is needed to achieve significant progress in our understanding of MC dynamics and function, and we make specific practical suggestions as to how this could be achieved.",

        "Abstract": "Pleiotropic regulatory mutations affect diverse cellular processes, posing a challenge to our understanding of\u00a0genotype-phenotype relationships across multiple biological scales. Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) allows for such mutations to be found and characterized in the context of clear selection pressures. Here, several ALE-selected single-mutation variants in RNA polymerase (RNAP) of Escherichia coli are detailed using an integrated multi-scale experimental and computational approach. While these mutations increase cellular growth rates in steady environments, they\u00a0reduce tolerance to stress and environmental fluctuations. We detail structural changes in the RNAP that rewire the transcriptional machinery to rebalance proteome and energy allocation toward growth and away from several hedging and stress functions. We find that while these mutations occur in diverse locations in the RNAP, they share a common adaptive mechanism. In turn, these findings highlight the resource allocation trade-offs organisms face and suggest how the structure of the regulatory network enhances evolvability.",

        "Title": "The Role of Genome Accessibility in Transcription Factor Binding in Bacteria.",
        "Abstract": "ChIP-seq enables genome-scale identification of regulatory regions that govern gene expression. However, the biological insights generated from ChIP-seq analysis have been limited to predictions of binding sites and cooperative interactions. Furthermore, ChIP-seq data often poorly correlate with in vitro measurements or predicted motifs, highlighting that binding affinity alone is insufficient to explain transcription factor (TF)-binding in vivo. One possibility is that binding sites are not equally accessible across the genome. A more comprehensive biophysical representation of TF-binding is required to improve our ability to understand, predict, and alter gene expression. Here, we show that genome accessibility is a key parameter that impacts TF-binding in bacteria. We developed a thermodynamic model that parameterizes ChIP-seq coverage in terms of genome accessibility and binding affinity. The role of genome accessibility is validated using a large-scale ChIP-seq dataset of the M. tuberculosis regulatory network. We find that accounting for genome accessibility led to a model that explains 63% of the ChIP-seq profile variance, while a model based in motif score alone explains only 35% of the variance. Moreover, our framework enables de novo ChIP-seq peak prediction and is useful for inferring TF-binding peaks in new experimental conditions by reducing the need for additional experiments. We observe that the genome is more accessible in intergenic regions, and that increased accessibility is positively correlated with gene expression and anti-correlated with distance to the origin of replication. Our biophysically motivated model provides a more comprehensive description of TF-binding in vivo from first principles towards a better representation of gene regulation in silico, with promising applications in systems biology.",

Specifically, we highlight emerging in situ genome engineering approaches as tractable techniques to manipulate microbial communities with high specificity and efficacy.

        "Abstract": "A large fraction of microbial life on earth exists in complex communities where metabolic exchange is vital. Microbes trade essential resources to promote their own growth in an analogous way to countries that exchange goods in modern economic markets. Inspired by these similarities, we developed a framework based on general equilibrium theory (GET) from economics to predict the population dynamics of trading microbial communities. Our biotic GET (BGET) model provides an a priori theory of the growth benefits of microbial trade, yielding several novel insights relevant to understanding microbial ecology and engineering synthetic communities. We find that the economic concept of comparative advantage is a necessary condition for mutualistic trade. Our model suggests that microbial communities can grow faster when species are unable to produce essential resources that are obtained through trade, thereby promoting metabolic specialization and increased intercellular exchange. Furthermore, we find that species engaged in trade exhibit a fundamental tradeoff between growth rate and relative population abundance, and that different environments that put greater pressure on group selection versus individual selection will promote varying strategies along this growth-abundance spectrum. We experimentally tested this tradeoff using a synthetic consortium of Escherichia coli cells and found the results match the predictions of the model. This framework provides a foundation to study natural and engineered microbial communities through a new lens based on economic theories developed over the past century.",

        "Abstract": "We conducted an open-label crossover trial to test whether proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) affect the gastrointestinal microbiome to facilitate Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Twelve healthy volunteers each donated 2 baseline fecal samples, 4 weeks apart (at weeks 0 and 4). They then took PPIs for 4 weeks (40 mg omeprazole, twice daily) and fecal samples were collected at week 8. Six individuals took the PPIs for an additional 4 weeks (from week 8 to 12) and fecal samples were collected from all subjects at week 12. Samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. We found no significant within-individual difference in microbiome diversity when we compared changes during baseline vs changes on PPIs. There were, however, significant changes during PPI use in taxa associated with CDI (increased Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae, decreased Clostridiales) and taxa associated with gastrointestinal bacterial overgrowth (increased Micrococcaceae and Staphylococcaceae). In a functional analysis, there were no changes in bile acids on PPIs, but there was an increase in genes involved in bacterial invasion. These alterations could provide a mechanism by which PPIs predispose to CDI. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01901276.",

        "Abstract": "Elucidating functions of commensal microbial genes in the mammalian gut is challenging because many commensals are recalcitrant to laboratory cultivation and genetic manipulation. We present Temporal FUnctional Metagenomics sequencing (TFUMseq), a platform to functionally mine bacterial genomes for genes that contribute to fitness of commensal bacteria in vivo. Our approach uses metagenomic DNA to construct large-scale heterologous expression libraries that are tracked over time in vivo by deep sequencing and computational methods. To demonstrate our approach, we built a TFUMseq plasmid library using the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) and introduced Escherichia coli carrying this library into germfree mice. Population dynamics of library clones revealed Bt genes conferring significant fitness advantages in E. coli over time, including carbohydrate utilization genes, with a Bt galactokinase central to early colonization, and subsequent dominance by a Bt glycoside hydrolase enabling sucrose metabolism coupled with co-evolution of the plasmid library and E. coli genome driving increased galactose utilization. Our findings highlight the utility of functional metagenomics for engineering commensal bacteria with improved properties, including expanded colonization capabilities in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Resistance arises quickly during chemotherapeutic selection and is particularly problematic during long-term treatment regimens such as those for tuberculosis, HIV infections, or cancer. Although drug combination therapy reduces the evolution of drug resistance, drug pairs vary in their ability to do so. Thus, predictive models are needed to rationally design resistance-limiting therapeutic regimens. Using adaptive evolution, we studied the resistance response of the common pathogen Escherichia coli to 5 different single antibiotics and all 10 different antibiotic drug pairs. By analyzing the genomes of all evolved E. coli lineages, we identified the mutational events that drive the differences in drug resistance levels and found that the degree of resistance development against drug combinations can be understood in terms of collateral sensitivity and resistance that occurred during adaptation to the component drugs. Then, using engineered E. coli strains, we confirmed that drug resistance mutations that imposed collateral sensitivity were suppressed in a drug pair growth environment. These results provide a framework for rationally selecting drug combinations that limit resistance evolution.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms that generate variation is a common pursuit unifying the life sciences. Bacteria represent an especially striking puzzle, because closely related strains possess radically different metabolic and ecological capabilities. Differences in protein repertoire arising from gene transfer are currently considered the primary mechanism underlying phenotypic plasticity in bacteria. Although bacterial coding plasticity has been extensively studied in previous decades, little is known about the role that regulatory plasticity plays in bacterial evolution. Here, we show that bacterial genes can rapidly shift between multiple regulatory modes by acquiring functionally divergent nonhomologous promoter regions. Through analysis of 270,000 regulatory regions across 247 genomes, we demonstrate that regulatory \"switching\" to nonhomologous alternatives is ubiquitous, occurring across the bacterial domain. Using comparative transcriptomics, we show that at least 16% of the expression divergence between Escherichia coli strains can be explained by this regulatory switching. Further, using an oligonucleotide regulatory library, we establish that switching affects bacterial promoter architecture. We provide evidence that regulatory switching can occur through horizontal regulatory transfer, which allows regulatory regions to move across strains, and even genera, independently from the genes they regulate. Finally, by experimentally characterizing the fitness effect of a regulatory transfer on a pathogenic E. coli strain, we demonstrate that regulatory switching elicits important phenotypic consequences. Taken together, our findings expose previously unappreciated regulatory plasticity in bacteria and provide a gateway for understanding bacterial phenotypic variation and adaptation.",

        "Abstract": "Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) allows simultaneous mutagenesis of multiple target sites in bacterial genomes using short oligonucleotides. However, large-scale mutagenesis requires hundreds to thousands of unique oligos, which are costly to synthesize and impossible to scale-up by traditional phosphoramidite column-based approaches. Here, we describe a novel method to amplify oligos from microarray chips for direct use in MAGE to perturb thousands of genomic sites simultaneously. We demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale mutagenesis by inserting T7 promoters upstream of 2585 operons in E. coli using this method, which we call Microarray-Oligonucleotide (MO)-MAGE. The resulting mutant library was characterized by high-throughput sequencing to show that all attempted insertions were estimated to have occurred at an average frequency of 0.02% per locus with 0.4 average insertions per cell. MO-MAGE enables cost-effective large-scale targeted genome engineering that should be useful for a variety of applications in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Recent progress in molecular biology and genetics opens up the possibility of engineering a variety of biological systems, from single-cellular to multicellular organisms. The consortia of microbes that reside on the human body, the human-associated microbiota, are particularly interesting as targets for forward engineering and manipulation due to their relevance in health and disease. New technologies in analysis and perturbation of the human microbiota will lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against diseases of microbial origin or pathogenesis. Here, we discuss recent advances that are bringing us closer to realizing the true potential of an engineered human-associated microbial community.",

        "Abstract": "Recombineering and multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) offer the possibility to rapidly modify multiple genomic or plasmid sites at high efficiencies. This enables efficient creation of genetic variants including both single mutants with specifically targeted modifications as well as combinatorial cell libraries. Manual design of oligonucleotides for these approaches can be tedious, time-consuming, and may not be practical for larger projects targeting many genomic sites. At present, the change from a desired phenotype (e.g. altered expression of a specific protein) to a designed MAGE oligo, which confers the corresponding genetic change, is performed manually. To address these challenges, we have developed the MAGE Oligo Design Tool (MODEST). This web-based tool allows designing of MAGE oligos for (i) tuning translation rates by modifying the ribosomal binding site, (ii) generating translational gene knockouts and (iii) introducing other coding or non-coding mutations, including amino acid substitutions, insertions, deletions and point mutations. The tool automatically designs oligos based on desired genotypic or phenotypic changes defined by the user, which can be used for high efficiency recombineering and MAGE. MODEST is available for free and is open to all users at http://modest.biosustain.dtu.dk.",

        "Abstract": "Metabolic crossfeeding is an important process that can broadly shape microbial communities. However, little is known about specific crossfeeding principles that drive the formation and maintenance of individuals within a mixed population. Here, we devised a series of synthetic syntrophic communities to probe the complex interactions underlying metabolic exchange of amino acids. We experimentally analyzed multimember, multidimensional communities of Escherichia coli of increasing sophistication to assess the outcomes of synergistic crossfeeding. We find that biosynthetically costly amino acids including methionine, lysine, isoleucine, arginine, and aromatics, tend to promote stronger cooperative interactions than amino acids that are cheaper to produce. Furthermore, cells that share common intermediates along branching pathways yielded more synergistic growth, but exhibited many instances of both positive and negative epistasis when these interactions scaled to higher dimensions. In more complex communities, we find certain members exhibiting keystone species-like behavior that drastically impact the community dynamics. Based on comparative genomic analysis of >6,000 sequenced bacteria from diverse environments, we present evidence suggesting that amino acid biosynthesis has been broadly optimized to reduce individual metabolic burden in favor of enhanced crossfeeding to support synergistic growth across the biosphere. These results improve our basic understanding of microbial syntrophy while also highlighting the utility and limitations of current modeling approaches to describe the dynamic complexities underlying microbial ecosystems. This work sets the foundation for future endeavors to resolve key questions in microbial ecology and evolution, and presents a platform to develop better and more robust engineered synthetic communities for industrial biotechnology.",

Here, we present a method for oligonucleotide-mediated recombineering in the model eukaryote and industrial production host Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which we call yeast oligo-mediated genome engineering (YOGE). Through a combination of overexpression and knockouts of relevant genes and optimization of transformation and oligonucleotide designs, we achieve high gene-modification frequencies at levels that only require screening of dozens of cells. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach in three divergent yeast strains, including those involved in industrial production of biobased chemicals. Furthermore, YOGE can be iteratively executed via cycling to generate genomic libraries up to 10 (5) individuals at each round for diversity generation. YOGE cycling alone or in combination with phenotypic selections or endonuclease-based negative genotypic selections can be used to generate modified alleles easily in yeast populations with high frequencies.",

        "Abstract": "Genome-modification technologies enable the rational engineering and perturbation of biological systems. Historically, these methods have been limited to gene insertions or mutations at random or at a few pre-defined locations across the genome. The handful of methods capable of targeted gene editing suffered from low efficiencies, significant labor costs, or both. Recent advances have dramatically expanded our ability to engineer cells in a directed and combinatorial manner. Here, we review current technologies and methodologies for genome-scale engineering, discuss the prospects for extending efficient genome modification to new hosts, and explore the implications of continued advances toward the development of flexibly programmable chasses, novel biochemistries, and safer organismal and ecological engineering.",

        "Title": "Improving lambda red genome engineering in Escherichia coli via rational removal of endogenous nucleases.",
        "Abstract": "Lambda Red recombineering is a powerful technique for making targeted genetic changes in bacteria. However, many applications are limited by the frequency of recombination. Previous studies have suggested that endogenous nucleases may hinder recombination by degrading the exogenous DNA used for recombineering. In this work, we identify ExoVII as a nuclease which degrades the ends of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cassettes. Removing this nuclease improves both recombination frequency and the inheritance of mutations at the 3' ends of ssDNA and dsDNA. Extending this approach, we show that removing a set of five exonucleases (RecJ, ExoI, ExoVII, ExoX, and Lambda Exo) substantially improves the performance of co-selection multiplex automatable genome engineering (CoS-MAGE). In a given round of CoS-MAGE with ten ssDNA oligonucleotides, the five nuclease knockout strain has on average 46% more alleles converted per clone, 200% more clones with five or more allele conversions, and 35% fewer clones without any allele conversions. Finally, we use these nuclease knockout strains to investigate and clarify the effects of oligonucleotide phosphorothioation on recombination frequency. The results described in this work provide further mechanistic insight into recombineering, and substantially improve recombineering performance.",

Here, we present an efficient Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) strategy to simultaneously modify and co-purify large protein complexes and pathways from the model organism Escherichia coli to reconstitute functional synthetic proteomes in vitro. By application of over 110 MAGE cycles, we successfully inserted hexa-histidine sequences into 38 essential genes in vivo that encode for the entire translation machinery. Streamlined co-purification and reconstitution of the translation protein complex enabled protein synthesis in vitro. Our approach can be applied to a growing area of applications in in vitro one-pot multienzyme catalysis (MEC) to manipulate or enhance in vitro pathways such as natural product or carbohydrate biosynthesis.",

Here we provide a review of recent progress in engineering natural and synthetic microbial ecosystems. We highlight important forward engineering design principles, theoretical and quantitative models, new experimental and manipulation tools, and possible applications of microbial ecosystem engineering. We argue that simply engineering individual microbes will lead to fragile homogenous populations that are difficult to sustain, especially in highly heterogeneous and unpredictable environments. Instead, engineered microbial ecosystems are likely to be more robust and able to achieve complex tasks at the spatial and temporal resolution needed for truly programmable biology.",

We used multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) to site-specifically replace all 314 TAG stop codons with synonymous TAA codons in parallel across 32 Escherichia coli strains. This approach allowed us to measure individual recombination frequencies, confirm viability for each modification, and identify associated phenotypes. We developed hierarchical conjugative assembly genome engineering (CAGE) to merge these sets of codon modifications into genomes with 80 precise changes, which demonstrate that these synonymous codon substitutions can be combined into higher-order strains without synthetic lethal effects. Our methods treat the chromosome as both an editable and an evolvable template, permitting the exploration of vast genetic landscapes.",

        "Abstract": "Genome engineering using single-stranded oligonucleotides is an efficient method for generating small chromosomal and episomal modifications in a variety of host organisms. The efficiency of this allelic replacement strategy is highly dependent on avoidance of the endogenous mismatch repair (MMR) machinery. However, global MMR inactivation generally results in significant accumulation of undesired background mutations. Here, we present a novel strategy using oligos containing chemically modified bases (2'-Fluoro-Uridine, 5-Methyl-deoxyCytidine, 2,6-Diaminopurine or Iso-deoxyGuanosine) in place of the standard T, C, A or G to avoid mismatch detection and repair, which we tested in Escherichia coli. This strategy increases transient allelic-replacement efficiencies by up to 20-fold, while maintaining a 100-fold lower background mutation level. We further show that the mismatched bases between the full length oligo and the chromosome are often not incorporated at the target site, probably due to nuclease activity at the 5' and 3' termini of the oligo. These results further elucidate the mechanism of oligo-mediated allelic replacement (OMAR) and enable improved methodologies for efficient, large-scale engineering of genomes.",

        "Abstract": "Engineering at the scale of whole genomes requires fundamentally new molecular biology tools. Recent advances in recombineering using synthetic oligonucleotides enable the rapid generation of mutants at high efficiency and specificity and can be implemented at the genome scale. With these techniques, libraries of mutants can be generated, from which individuals with functionally useful phenotypes can be isolated. Furthermore, populations of cells can be evolved in situ by directed evolution using complex pools of oligonucleotides. Here, we discuss ways to utilize these multiplexed genome engineering methods, with special emphasis on experimental design and implementation.",

        "Abstract": "The breadth of genomic diversity found among organisms in nature allows populations to adapt to diverse environments. However, genomic diversity is difficult to generate in the laboratory and new phenotypes do not easily arise on practical timescales. Although in vitro and directed evolution methods have created genetic variants with usefully altered phenotypes, these methods are limited to laborious and serial manipulation of single genes and are not used for parallel and continuous directed evolution of gene networks or genomes. Here, we describe multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. MAGE simultaneously targets many locations on the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because the process is cyclical and scalable, we constructed prototype devices that automate the MAGE technology to facilitate rapid and continuous generation of a diverse set of genetic changes (mismatches, insertions, deletions). We applied MAGE to optimize the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce the industrially important isoprenoid lycopene. Twenty-four genetic components in the DXP pathway were modified simultaneously using a complex pool of synthetic DNA, creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day. We isolated variants with more than fivefold increase in lycopene production within 3 days, a significant improvement over existing metabolic engineering techniques. Our multiplex approach embraces engineering in the context of evolution by expediting the design and evolution of organisms with new and improved properties.",
