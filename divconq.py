Born in 1751 in Orange County, Virginia, and educated at Princeton, Madison was a prominent figure in the Virginia Assembly, Continental Congress, and the Constitutional Convention. Despite his less charismatic public persona, his wife Dolley was widely admired. Madison played a key role in drafting the Bill of Rights and opposing Hamilton's financial policies, which led to the formation of the Republican Party. As Secretary of State, he confronted France and Britain over their violations of American shipping rights, leading to the Embargo Act of 1807. Elected President in 1808, he faced challenges including the War of 1812, driven by issues such as British impressment of American seamen and trade restrictions. Madison's presidency saw the repeal of the Embargo Act and the eventual declaration of war against Britain on June 1, 1812."], 2)
