    "jason adelman md": "Dr. Adelman’s Patient Safety Research Program began with the development of the Wrong-Patient Retract-and-Reorder (RAR) Measure—a valid and reliable method of quantifying the frequency of wrong-patient orders placed in electronic ordering systems. The Wrong-Patient RAR measure was the first automated measure of medical errors and the first Health IT Safety Measure endorsed by the National Quality Forum. The RAR method identifies thousands of near-miss, wrong-patient errors per year in large health systems, enabling researchers to test interventions to prevent this type of error.\nThe Wrong-Patient RAR measure has been used to evaluate the effectiveness of patient safety interventions in several studies conducted in different electronic health record systems and clinical settings, including in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The measure is the primary outcome measure for three federally funded studies supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (R21HS023704, R01HS024945) and the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (R01HD094793). Additional research is underway to extend the RAR methodology to other types of errors, such as wrong-drug errors, and develop new health IT safety measures (R01HS024538).\nResults of Dr. Adelman’s research led to national patient safety guidance, including a recommendation issued by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology that healthcare organizations use the Wrong-Patient RAR measure to monitor the frequency of wrong-patient orders. Effective 2019, The Joint Commission will require that hospitals adopt a distinct newborn naming convention that incorporates the mother’s first name, based on studies by Adelman and colleagues.",

    "andrea califano": "Andrea Califano, Dr., is a pioneer in the field of systems biology and founding chair of the Department of Systems Biology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. A physicist by training, Dr. Califano has taken innovative, systematic approaches to identify the molecular factors that lead to cancer progression and to the emergence of drug resistance at the single-cell level. Directing the conversation about cancer research away from focusing solely on gene mutations, Dr. Califano examines the complex and tumor-specific molecular interaction networks that determine cancer cell behavior. Using information theoretic approaches, analysis of these networks can precisely pinpoint master regulator proteins that are mechanistically responsible for supporting tumorigenesis and for implementing tumor cell homeostasis. Dr. Califano and his lab have shown that master regulators represent critical drivers and tumor dependencies, despite the fact that they are rarely mutated or differentially expressed, thus establishing them as a bona fide new class of therapeutic targets.\n\nThe Califano Systems Biology Lab combines computational and experimental methodologies to reconstruct the regulatory and signaling logic of human cells in genome-wide fashion. In addition, his lab has developed methods for the systematic discovery of small molecule compounds and combinations that can inactivate master regulator proteins in cancer, thus providing novel therapeutic hypotheses that can be validated pre-clinically and clinically. Indeed, several of his findings have been translated into clinical studies, including an innovative N-of-1 study at Columbia in which master regulators are identified and pharmacologically targeted on an individual patient basis in several aggressive malignancies, thus getting a step closer to deliver on the promise of a truly mechanistic implementation of precision medicine.\n\nDr. Califano’s master regulator analyses have led to several discoveries that are being tested in the clinics, including the drug entinostat in a subset of metastatic neuroendocrine tumor patients, the use of combination therapy in HER2+ and inflammatory breast cancer, and additional phase 2 clinical trials in patients with recurrent pancreatic ductal carcinoma and metastatic prostate cancer.

He moved to Columbia University as an Assistant Professor in 2008, with a joint appointment in the Department of Systems Biology and the Department of Biomedical Informatics. At Columbia University, Rabadan has put together a highly interdisciplinary lab with researchers from the fields of mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering, and medicine, with the common goal of solving pressing biomedical problems through quantitative computational models. The amount of high-throughput data in biological and clinical systems — from next-generation sequencing experiments to electronic health records — is increasing dramatically, allowing for the development of a quantitative understanding of these complex systems. Rabadan’s lab consists of an interdisciplinary team developing mathematical and computational tools to extract useful biological information from large data sets. Rabadan’s work focuses on three distinct topics: 1) Infectious diseases. Evolution is a dynamic process that shapes genomes. Our team at Columbia is developing algorithms and software to analyze genomic data with a view to understanding the molecular biology, population genetics, phylogeny, and epidemiology of viruses. 2) Evolution of cancer genomes. Next-generation sequencing technologies provide an extraordinary opportunity to identify somatic mutations that contribute to the development of tumors. We are establishing methods to identify cancer-driving mutations in high-throughput sequencing data sets. 3) Electronic health records. Clinical databases provide a rich and complex source of raw data. We are using the power of statistics and computers to tease out important clinical patterns in these diverse, important data sets.
