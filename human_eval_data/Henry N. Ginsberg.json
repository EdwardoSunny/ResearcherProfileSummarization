        "Abstract": "LCAT (lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase) catalyzes the conversion of unesterified, or free cholesterol, to cholesteryl ester, which moves from the surface of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) into the neutral lipid core. As this iterative process continues, nascent lipid-poor HDL is converted to a series of larger, spherical cholesteryl ester-enriched HDL particles that can be cleared by the liver in a process that has been termed reverse cholesterol transport.",

A genetic variant from glutamic acid to lysine substitution at amino acid position 167 (NM_001001524.3:c.499G> A) (p.Gln167Lys/p.E167K, rs58542926) was discovered (p.E167K) to be highly associated with increased hepatic fat content and reduced levels of plasma triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. In this review, we focus on the discovery of TM6SF2 and its role in VLDL secretion pathways. Human data suggest TM6SF2 is linked to hepatic steatosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD), hence understanding its metabolic pathways is of high scientific interest.",

        "Title": "VLDL Biogenesis and Secretion: It Takes a Village.",
        "Abstract": "The production and secretion of VLDLs (very-low-density lipoproteins) by hepatocytes has a direct impact on liver fat content, as well as the concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides in the circulation and thus affects both liver and cardiovascular health, respectively. Importantly, insulin resistance, excess caloric intake, and lack of physical activity are associated with overproduction of VLDL, hepatic steatosis, and increased plasma levels of atherogenic lipoproteins. Cholesterol and triglycerides in remnant particles generated by VLDL lipolysis are risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and have garnered increasing attention over the last few decades. Presently, however, increased risk of atherosclerosis is not the only concern when considering today's cardiometabolic patients, as they often also experience hepatic steatosis, a prevalent disorder that can progress to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. This duality of metabolic risk highlights the importance of understanding the molecular regulation of the biogenesis of VLDL, the lipoprotein that transports triglycerides and cholesterol out of the liver. Fortunately, there has been a resurgence of interest in the intracellular assembly, trafficking, degradation, and secretion of VLDL by hepatocytes, which has led to many exciting new molecular insights that are the topic of this review. Increasing our understanding of the biology of this pathway will aid to the identification of novel therapeutic targets to improve both the cardiovascular and the hepatic health of cardiometabolic patients. This review focuses, for the first time, on this duality.",

        "Abstract": "Depletion of torsinA from hepatocytes leads to reduced liver triglyceride secretion and marked hepatic steatosis. TorsinA is an atypical ATPase that lacks intrinsic activity unless it is bound to its activator, lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1) or luminal domain-like LAP1 (LULL1). We previously demonstrated that depletion of LAP1 from hepatocytes has more modest effects on liver triglyceride secretion and steatosis development than depletion of torsinA. We now show that depletion of LULL1 alone does not significantly decrease triglyceride secretion or cause steatosis. However, simultaneous depletion of both LAP1 and LULL1 leads to defective triglyceride secretion and marked steatosis similar to that observed with depletion of torsinA. Depletion of both LAP1 and torsinA from hepatocytes generated phenotypes similar to those observed with only torsinA depletion, implying that the 2 proteins act in the same pathway in liver lipid metabolism. Our results demonstrate that torsinA and its activators dynamically regulate hepatic lipid metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "Background The Hp (haptoglobin)2-2 phenotype (~40% of people) is associated with dysfunctional high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that is heavily oxidized in hyperglycemia, which may explain why raising HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) does not reliably prevent coronary artery disease (CAD) in diabetes. Methods and Results In this observational study using longitudinal data from the ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) lipid trial, time-varying (achieved) HDL-C updated at 4, 8, and 12\u2009months, and annually thereafter over a mean of 4.7\u2009years, was analyzed in relation to risk of CAD and secondary outcomes using Cox proportional hazards regression with time-varying covariables among participants with (n=1781) and without (n=3191) the Hp2-2 phenotype. HDL-C did not differ between the phenotypes throughout the study. Having low HDL-C (<40 mg/dL for male participants and <50 mg/dL for female participants) was associated with a greater risk of CAD compared with non-low HDL-C among participants with the non-Hp2-2 phenotype (hazard ratio [HR], 1.48 [95% CI, 1.18-1.87]) but not among the Hp2-2 phenotype (HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.70-1.35]; ",

        "Abstract": "Apolipoprotein B (apoB)-lipoproteins initiate and promote atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Plasma tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity is negatively associated with atherogenic apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol levels in humans, but the mechanisms are unknown. We found that tPA, partially through the lysine-binding site on its Kringle 2 domain, binds to the N terminus of apoB, blocking the interaction between apoB and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in hepatocytes, thereby reducing very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and plasma apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) sequesters tPA away from apoB and increases VLDL assembly. Humans with PAI-1 deficiency have smaller VLDL particles and lower plasma levels of apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol. These results suggest a mechanism that fine-tunes VLDL assembly by intracellular interactions among tPA, PAI-1, and apoB in hepatocytes.",

        "Title": "TM6SF2 Determines Both the Degree of Lipidation and the Number of VLDL Particles Secreted by the Liver.",
        "Abstract": "In 2014, exome-wide studies identified a glutamine176lysine (p.E167K) substitution in a protein of unknown function named transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2). The p.E167K variant was associated with increased hepatic fat content and reduced levels of plasma TG and LDL cholesterol. Over the next several years, additional studies defined the role of TM6SF2, which resides in the ER and the ER-Golgi interface, in the lipidation of nascent VLDL to generate mature, more TG-rich VLDL. Consistent results from cells and rodents indicated that the secretion of TG was reduced in the p.E167K variant or when hepatic TM6SF2 was deleted. However, data for secretion of APOB was inconsistent, either reduced or increased secretion was observed. A recent study of people homozygous for the variant demonstrated reduced in vivo secretion of large, TG-rich VLDL1 into plasma; both TG and APOB secretion were reduced. Here we present new results demonstrating increased secretion of VLDL APOB with no change in TG secretion in p.E167K homozygous individuals from the Lancaster Amish community compared to their wild-type siblings. Our in vivo kinetic tracer results are supported by in vitro experiments in HepG2 and McA cells with knock-down or Crispr-deletions of TM6SF2, respectively. We offer a model to potentially explain all of the prior data and our new results.",

Driven by genetic cohort studies, inhibitors of APOC3 (apolipoprotein C3) and ANGPTL (angiopoietin-like protein) 3 that reduce circulating triglycerides are poised to enter clinical practice. We will review the biology of how inhibition of these 2 proteins affects circulating lipoproteins as well as the current state of clinical development of monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, and silencing RNAs targeting APOC3 and ANGPTL3.",

        "Title": "Hepatocytes Deficient in Nuclear Envelope Protein Lamina-associated Polypeptide 1 are an Ideal Mammalian System to Study Intranuclear Lipid Droplets.",
        "Abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are generally considered to be synthesized in the ER and utilized in the cytoplasm. However, LDs have been observed inside nuclei in some cells, although recent research on nuclear LDs has focused on cultured cell lines. To better understand nuclear LDs that occur in\u00a0vivo, here we examined LDs in primary hepatocytes from mice following depletion of the nuclear envelope protein lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1). Microscopic image analysis showed that LAP1-depleted hepatocytes contain frequent nuclear LDs, which differ from cytoplasmic LDs in their associated proteins. We found type 1 nucleoplasmic reticula, which are invaginations of the inner nuclear membrane, are often associated with nuclear LDs in these hepatocytes. Furthermore, in\u00a0vivo depletion of the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A and C from mouse hepatocytes led to severely abnormal nuclear morphology, but significantly fewer nuclear LDs than were observed upon depletion of LAP1. In addition, we show both high-fat diet feeding and fasting of mice increased cytoplasmic lipids in LAP1-depleted hepatocytes but reduced nuclear LDs, demonstrating a relationship of LD formation with nutritional state. Finally, depletion of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein did not change the frequency of nuclear LDs in LAP1-depleted hepatocytes, suggesting that it is not required for the biogenesis of nuclear LDs in these cells. Together, these data show that LAP1-depleted hepatocytes represent an ideal mammalian system to investigate the biogenesis of nuclear LDs and their partitioning between the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to changes in nutritional state and cellular metabolism in\u00a0vivo.",

We set out to identify players in the VLDL biogenesis pathway by identifying genes that are co-expressed with the MTTP gene that encodes for microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, key to the lipidation of apolipoprotein B, the core protein of VLDL.

        "Abstract": "Statins are the cornerstone of the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, even under optimal statin therapy, a significant residual ASCVD risk remains. Therefore, there has been an unmet clinical need for novel lipid-lowering agents that can target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and other atherogenic particles. During the past decade, several drugs have been developed for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Inclisiran, a small interfering RNA that targets proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), shows comparable effects to that of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies. Bempedoic acid, an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor, is a valuable treatment option for the patients with statin intolerance. Pemafibrate, the first selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulator, showed a favorable benefit-risk balance in phase 2 trial, but the large clinical phase 3 trial (PROMINENT) was recently stopped for futility based on a late interim analysis. High dose icosapent ethyl, a modified eicosapentaenoic acid preparation, shows cardiovascular benefits. Evinacumab, an angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) monoclonal antibody, reduces plasma LDL-C levels in patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia. Novel antisense oligonucleotides targeting apolipoprotein C3 (apoC3), ANGPTL3, and lipoprotein(a) have significantly attenuated the levels of their target molecules with beneficial effects on associated dyslipidemias. Apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) is considered as a potential treatment to exploit the athero-protective effects of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), but solid clinical evidence is necessary. In this review, we discuss the mode of action and clinical outcomes of these novel lipid-lowering agents beyond statins.",

        "Abstract": "FGF19/FGF15 is an endocrine regulator of hepatic bile salt and lipid metabolism, which has shown promising effects in the treatment of NASH in clinical trials. FGF19/15 is transcribed and released from enterocytes of the small intestine into enterohepatic circulation in response to bile-induced FXR activation. Previously, the TSS of FGF19 was identified to bind Wnt-regulated TCF7L2/encoded transcription factor TCF4 in colorectal cancer cells. Impaired Wnt signaling and specifical loss of function of its coreceptor LRP6\u00a0have been associated with NASH. We, therefore, examined if TCF7L2/TCF4 upregulates Fgf19 in the small intestine and restrains NASH through gut-liver crosstalk. We examined the mice globally overexpressing, haploinsufficient, and conditional knockout models of TCF7L2 in the intestinal epithelium. The TCF7L2",

LDL cholesterol remained the main target and a variety of drugs to lower LDL cholesterol through different mechanisms were explored. Emerging evidence on the atherogenity of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins led to renewed interest in lowering them with new treatments. Lp(a) was back in focus with evidence on causality and new targeted therapeutics which dramatically lower Lp(a) levels. We will be able to personalise lipid lowering therapy further with this enriched armamentarium once we have the results of the cardiovascular outcome studies with some of these new agents.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in Dyrk1b are associated with metabolic syndrome and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in humans. Our investigations showed that DYRK1B levels are increased in the liver of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and in mice fed with a high-fat, high-sucrose diet. Increasing Dyrk1b levels in the mouse liver enhanced de novo lipogenesis (DNL), fatty acid uptake, and triacylglycerol secretion and caused NASH and hyperlipidemia. Conversely, knockdown of Dyrk1b was protective against high-calorie-induced hepatic steatosis and fibrosis and hyperlipidemia. Mechanistically, Dyrk1b increased DNL by activating mTORC2 in a kinase-independent fashion. Accordingly, the Dyrk1b-induced NASH was fully rescued when mTORC2 was genetically disrupted. The elevated DNL was associated with increased plasma membrane sn-1,2-diacylglyerol levels and increased PKC\u03b5-mediated IRKT1150 phosphorylation, which resulted in impaired activation of hepatic insulin signaling and reduced hepatic glycogen storage. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms that underlie Dyrk1b-induced hepatic lipogenesis and hepatic insulin resistance and identify Dyrk1b as a therapeutic target for NASH and insulin resistance in the liver.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate assessment of LDL-C levels is important, as they are often used for treatment recommendations. For many years, plasma LDL-C levels were calculated using the Friedewald equation, but there are limitations to this method compared with direct measurement via beta-quantification (BQ). Here, we assessed differences between the Friedewald, Martin-Hopkins, and NIH equation 2 methods of calculating LDL-C and the \"gold standard\" BQ method using pooled phase 3 data with alirocumab. All randomized patients were included irrespective of the treatment arm (n\u00a0= 6,122). We compared pairs of LDL-C values (n = 17,077) determined by each equation and BQ. We found that BQ-derived LDL-C values ranged from 1 to 397\u00a0mg/dl (mean 90.68\u00a0mg/dl). There were strong correlations between Friedewald-calculated, Martin-Hopkins-calculated, and NIH equation 2-calculated LDL-C with BQ-determined LDL-C values (Pearson's correlation coefficient\u00a0= 0.985, 0.981, and 0.985, respectively). Importantly, for BQ-derived LDL-C values \u226570\u00a0mg/dl, only 3.2%, 1.4%, and 1.8% of Friedewald-calculated, Martin-Hopkins-calculated, and NIH equation 2-calculated values were <70\u00a0mg/dl, respectively. When triglyceride (TG) levels were <150\u00a0mg/dl, differences between calculated and BQ-derived LDL-C values were minimal, regardless of the LDL-C level (<40, <55, or <70\u00a0mg/dl). However, when TG levels were >150\u00a0mg/dl, NIH equation 2 provided greater accuracy than Friedewald or Martin-Hopkins. When TGs were >250\u00a0mg/dl, inaccuracies were seen with all three methods, although NIH equation 2 remained the most accurate. In conclusion, LDL-C calculated by any of the three methods can guide treatment decisions for most patients, including those treated with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors.",

        "Abstract": "High levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], an apoB100-containing lipoprotein, are an independent and causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases through mechanisms associated with increased atherogenesis, inflammation, and thrombosis. Lp(a) is predominantly a monogenic cardiovascular risk determinant, with \u224870% to \u226590% of interindividual heterogeneity in levels being genetically determined. The 2 major protein components of Lp(a) particles are apoB100 and apolipoprotein(a). Lp(a) remains a risk factor for cardiovascular disease development even in the setting of effective reduction of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoB100. Despite its demonstrated contribution to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease burden, we presently lack standardization and harmonization of assays, universal guidelines for diagnosing and providing risk assessment, and targeted treatments to lower Lp(a). There is a clinical need to understand the genetic and biological basis for variation in Lp(a) levels and its relationship to disease in different ancestry groups. This scientific statement capitalizes on the expertise of a diverse basic science and clinical workgroup to highlight the history, biology, pathophysiology, and emerging clinical evidence in the Lp(a) field. Herein, we address key knowledge gaps and future directions required to mitigate the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk attributable to elevated Lp(a) levels.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in human genetics, together with a large body of epidemiologic, preclinical, and clinical trial results, provide strong support for a causal association between triglycerides (TG), TG-rich lipoproteins (TRL), and TRL remnants, and increased risk of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and aortic valve stenosis. These data also indicate that TRL and their remnants may contribute significantly to residual cardiovascular risk in patients on optimized low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering therapy. This statement critically appraises current understanding of the structure, function, and metabolism of TRL, and their pathophysiological role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Key points are (i) a working definition of normo- and hypertriglyceridaemic states and their relation to risk of ASCVD, (ii) a conceptual framework for the generation of remnants due to dysregulation of TRL production, lipolysis, and remodelling, as well as clearance of remnant lipoproteins from the circulation, (iii) the pleiotropic proatherogenic actions of TRL and remnants at the arterial wall, (iv) challenges in defining, quantitating, and assessing the atherogenic properties of remnant particles, and (v) exploration of the relative atherogenicity of TRL and remnants compared to LDL. Assessment of these issues provides a foundation for evaluating approaches to effectively reduce levels of TRL and remnants by targeting either production, lipolysis, or hepatic clearance, or a combination of these mechanisms. This consensus statement updates current understanding in an integrated manner, thereby providing a platform for new therapeutic paradigms targeting TRL and their remnants, with the aim of reducing the risk of ASCVD.",

Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and T2D are at particularly high risk for recurrent MACE despite evidence-based therapies. It is uncertain to what extent this risk is further magnified in patients with recent ACS who are treated with insulin.

        "Abstract": "Rapidly increasing costs have been a major threat to our clinical research enterprise. Improvement in appointment scheduling is a crucial means to boost efficiency and save cost in clinical research and has been well studied in the outpatient setting. This study reviews nearly 5 years of usage data of an integrated scheduling system implemented at Columbia University/New York Presbyterian (CUIMC/NYP) called IMPACT and provides original insights into the challenges faced by a clinical research facility. Briefly, the IMPACT data shows that high rates of room and resource changes correlate with rescheduled appointments and that rescheduled visits are more likely to be attended than non-rescheduled visits. We highlight the differing roles of schedulers, coordinators, and investigators, and propose a highly accurate predictive model of participant no-shows in a research setting. This study sheds light on ways to reduce overall cost and improve the care we offer to clinical research participants.",

        "Abstract": "The burden of liver diseases is increasing worldwide, accounting for two million deaths annually. In the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in the basic and translational research of liver tissue engineering. Liver microtissues are small, three-dimensional hepatocyte cultures that recapitulate liver physiology and have been used in biomedical research and regenerative medicine. This review summarizes recent advances, challenges, and future directions in liver microtissue research. Cellular engineering approaches are used to sustain primary hepatocytes or produce hepatocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells and other adult tissues. Three-dimensional microtissues are generated by scaffold-free assembly or scaffold-assisted methods such as macroencapsulation, droplet microfluidics, and bioprinting. Optimization of the hepatic microenvironment entails incorporating the appropriate cell composition for enhanced cell-cell interactions and niche-specific signals, and creating scaffolds with desired chemical, mechanical and physical properties. Perfusion-based culture systems such as bioreactors and microfluidic systems are used to achieve efficient exchange of nutrients and soluble factors. Taken together, systematic optimization of liver microtissues is a multidisciplinary effort focused on creating liver cultures and on-chip models with greater structural complexity and physiological relevance for use in liver disease research, therapeutic development, and regenerative medicine.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetes is now a pandemic disease. Moreover, a large number of people with prediabetes are at risk for developing frank diabetes worldwide. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Even with statin treatment to lower LDL cholesterol, patients with diabetes have a high residual CVD risk. Factors mediating the residual risk are incompletely characterized. An attractive hypothesis is that remnant lipoprotein particles (RLPs), derived by lipolysis from VLDL and chylomicrons, contribute to this residual risk. RLPs constitute a heterogeneous population of lipoprotein particles, varying markedly in size and composition. Although a universally accepted definition is lacking, for the purpose of this review we define RLPs as postlipolytic partially triglyceride-depleted particles derived from chylomicrons and VLDL that are relatively enriched in cholesteryl esters and apolipoprotein (apo)E. RLPs derived from chylomicrons contain apoB48, while those derived from VLDL contain apoB100. Clarity as to the role of RLPs in CVD risk is hampered by lack of a widely accepted definition and a paucity of adequate methods for their accurate and precise quantification. New specific methods for RLP quantification would greatly improve our understanding of their biology and role in promoting atherosclerosis in diabetes and other disorders.",

A common polymorphism at the haptoglobin (Hp) genetic locus is associated with CVD, especially coronary heart disease, in the setting of hyperglycemia.",

        "Abstract": "Hypertriglyceridaemia is a common clinical problem. Epidemiologic and genetic studies have established that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and their remnants as important contributors to ASCVD while severe hypertriglyceridaemia raises risk of pancreatitis. While low-density lipoprotein is the primary treatment target for lipid lowering therapy, secondary targets that reflect the contribution of TRL such as apoB and non-HDL-C are recommended in the current guidelines. Reduction of severely elevated triglycerides is important to avert or reduce the risk of pancreatitis. Here we discuss interventions for hypertriglyceridaemia, including diet and lifestyle, established treatments such as fibrates and omega-3 fatty acid preparations and emerging therapies, including various biological agents.",

        "Abstract": "Alirocumab, an antibody that blocks PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), was associated with reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and death in the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab). In this study, higher baseline levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) predicted greater benefit from alirocumab treatment. Recent studies indicate high polygenic risk scores (PRS) for coronary artery disease (CAD) identify individuals at higher risk who derive increased benefit from statins. We performed post hoc analyses to determine whether high PRS for CAD identifies higher-risk individuals, independent of baseline LDL-C and other known risk factors, who might derive greater benefit from alirocumab treatment.",

However, in practice, underdiagnosis and undertreatment of these disorders are common, in large part due to interindividual variability in the genetic causes and phenotypic presentation of these conditions. To address these challenges, the European Atherosclerosis Society formed a task force to provide practical clinical guidance focusing on patients with extreme concentrations (either low or high) of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The task force also recognises the scarcity of quality information regarding the prevalence and outcomes of these conditions. Collaborative registries are needed to improve health policy for the care of patients with rare dyslipidaemias.",

        "Abstract": "In this issue of the JCI, Kanter et al. make a strong case for implicating apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) as a central player in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease that is commonly seen in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Kanter and colleagues suggest that insulin deficiency elevates plasma APOC3 as well as atherogenic triglyceride-rich (TG-rich) lipoproteins (TRLs). Using two mouse models of T1DM, the authors investigated APOC3-mediated inhibition of both TG hydrolysis by lipoprotein lipase and hepatic uptake of remnant lipoproteins. They suggest that poorly catabolized lipoproteins, enriched in both APOC3 and APOE content, are particularly atherogenic. Notably, treating both mouse models with an APOC3 antisense oligonucleotide lowered both plasma APOC3 and TRLs, and prevented atherosclerosis. These impactful mouse studies were supported by the initial finding that APOC3 predicted coronary artery disease events in participants of the prospective Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes study with normal TG levels.",

        "Abstract": "Deciphering novel pathways regulating liver lipid content has profound implications for understanding the pathophysiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Recent evidence suggests that the nuclear envelope is a site of regulation of lipid metabolism but there is limited appreciation of the responsible mechanisms and molecular components within this organelle. We showed that conditional hepatocyte deletion of the inner nuclear membrane protein lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1) caused defective VLDL secretion and steatosis, including intranuclear lipid accumulation. LAP1 binds to and activates torsinA, an AAA+ ATPase that resides in the perinuclear space and continuous main ER. Deletion of torsinA from mouse hepatocytes caused even greater reductions in VLDL secretion and profound steatosis. Both of these mutant mouse lines developed hepatic steatosis and subsequent steatohepatitis on a regular chow diet in the absence of whole-body insulin resistance or obesity. Our results establish an essential role for the nuclear envelope-localized torsinA-LAP1 complex in hepatic VLDL secretion and suggest that the torsinA pathway participates in the pathophysiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.",

        "Abstract": "In the era of precision medicine, treatments that target specific modifiable characteristics of high-risk patients have the potential to lower further the residual risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. Correction of atherogenic dyslipidemia, however, remains a major unmet clinical need. Elevated plasma triglycerides, with or without low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), offer a key modifiable component of this common dyslipidemia, especially in insulin resistant conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. The development of selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulators (SPPARM\u03b1) offers an approach to address this treatment gap. This Joint Consensus Panel appraised evidence for the first SPPARM\u03b1 agonist and concluded that this agent represents a novel therapeutic class, distinct from fibrates, based on pharmacological activity, and, importantly, a safe hepatic and renal profile. The ongoing PROMINENT cardiovascular outcomes trial is testing in 10,000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, elevated triglycerides, and low levels of HDL-C whether treatment with this SPPARM\u03b1 agonist safely reduces residual cardiovascular risk.",

        "Abstract": "Objective- Apo (apolipoprotein) CIII inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LpL)-mediated lipolysis of VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) triglyceride (TG) and decreases hepatic uptake of VLDL remnants. The discovery that 5% of Lancaster Old Order Amish are heterozygous for the APOC3 R19X null mutation provided the opportunity to determine the effects of a naturally occurring reduction in apo CIII levels on the metabolism of atherogenic containing lipoproteins. Approach and Results- We conducted stable isotope studies of VLDL-TG and apoB100 in 5 individuals heterozygous for the null mutation APOC3 R19X (CT) and their unaffected (CC) siblings. Fractional clearance rates and production rates of VLDL-TG and apoB100 in VLDL, IDL (intermediate-density lipoprotein), LDL, apo CIII, and apo CII were determined. Affected (CT) individuals had 49% reduction in plasma apo CIII levels compared with CCs ( P<0.01) and reduced plasma levels of TG (35%, P<0.02), VLDL-TG (45%, P<0.02), and VLDL-apoB100 (36%, P<0.05). These changes were because of higher fractional clearance rates of VLDL-TG and VLDL-apoB100 with no differences in production rates. CTs had higher rates of the conversion of VLDL remnants to LDL compared with CCs. In contrast, rates of direct removal of VLDL remnants did not differ between the groups. As a result, the flux of apoB100 from VLDL to LDL was not reduced, and the plasma levels of LDL-cholesterol and LDL-apoB100 were not lower in the CT group. Apo CIII production rate was lower in CTs compared with CCs, whereas apo CII production rate was not different between the 2 groups. The fractional clearance rates of both apo CIII and apo CII were higher in CTs than CCs. Conclusions- These studies demonstrate that 50% reductions in plasma apo CIII, in otherwise healthy subjects, results in a significantly higher rate of conversion of VLDL to LDL, with little effect on direct hepatic uptake of VLDL. When put in the context of studies demonstrating significant protection from cardiovascular events in individuals with loss of function variants in the APOC3 gene, our results provide strong evidence that therapies which increase the efficiency of conversion of VLDL to LDL, thereby reducing remnant concentrations, should reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.",

        "Abstract": "Background In statin trials, men and women derived similar relative risk reductions in cardiovascular events per 39\u00a0mg/ dL low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL -C) reduction. We explored whether lower LDL -C levels and greater LDL -C percentage reductions than those achieved with statins are associated with reduced major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) rates in women as well as men. Methods and Results Data pooled from 10 phase 3 ODYSSEY randomized trials (n=4983) comparing alirocumab with control (placebo/ezetimibe) were assessed for association between 39\u00a0mg/dL lower on-treatment LDL -C and percentage LDL -C change from baseline, and MACE risk by sex, using multivariable Cox regression. Mean baseline LDL -C was 135\u00a0mg/dL (women) and 121\u00a0mg/dL (men). Average on-treatment LDL -C levels with alirocumab, ezetimibe, and placebo were 71, 114, and 134\u00a0mg/dL, respectively, in women (n=1882) and 52, 93, and 122\u00a0mg/dL, respectively, in men (n=3090). Overall, 36.5% and 58.7% of women and men, respectively, achieved on-treatment LDL -C <50\u00a0mg/dL. Each 39\u00a0mg/dL lower LDL -C was associated with a 33% and 22%\u00a0lower risk of MACE in women ( P=0.0209) and men ( P=0.0307), respectively, with no significant between-sex difference ( P for heterogeneity=0.4597). Results were similar when analyzed per 50% LDL -C reduction, 24% ( P=0.1094) and 29% ( P=0.0125) lower MACE risk in women and men, respectively ( P for heterogeneity=0.7499). Alirocumab was generally well tolerated in both sexes. Conclusions The present analysis reinforces the notion that both sexes derive a similar cardiovascular benefit from LDL -C lowering. Although women had slightly higher on-treatment LDL -C than men, both sexes showed a similar lower MACE risk with lower LDL -C.",

        "Abstract": "Elevated lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels increase the risk for CVD. Novel treatments that decrease LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) have also shown promise for reducing Lp(a) levels. Mipomersen, an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits apoB synthesis, is approved for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. It decreases plasma levels of LDL-C by 25% to 39% and lowers levels of Lp(a) by 21% to 39%. We examined the mechanisms for Lp(a) lowering during mipomersen treatment. We enrolled 14 healthy volunteers who received weekly placebo injections for 3 weeks followed by weekly injections of mipomersen for 7 weeks. Stable isotope kinetic studies were performed using deuterated leucine at the end of the placebo and mipomersen treatment periods. The fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of Lp(a) was determined from the enrichment of a leucine-containing peptide specific to apo(a) by LC/MS. The production rate (PR) of Lp(a) was calculated from the product of Lp(a) FCR and Lp(a) concentration (converted to pool size). In a diverse population, mipomersen reduced plasma Lp(a) levels by 21%. In the overall study group, mipomersen treatment resulted in a 27% increase in the FCR of Lp(a) with no significant change in PR. However, there was heterogeneity in the response to mipomersen therapy, and changes in both FCRs and PRs affected the degree of change in Lp(a) concentrations. Mipomersen treatment decreases Lp(a) plasma levels mainly by increasing the FCR of Lp(a), although changes in Lp(a) PR were significant predictors of reductions in Lp(a) levels in some subjects.",

        "Abstract": "Excess plasma triglycerides (TGs) are a key component of obesity-induced metabolic syndrome. We have shown that \u03b3-secretase inhibitor (GSI) treatment improves glucose tolerance due to inhibition of hepatic Notch signaling but found additional Notch-independent reduction of plasma TG-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) in GSI-treated, as well as hepatocyte-specific, \u03b3-secretase knockout (L-Ncst) mice, which suggested a primary effect on hepatocyte TRL uptake. Indeed, we found increased VLDL and LDL particle uptake in L-Ncst hepatocytes and Ncst-deficient hepatoma cells, in part through reduced \u03b3-secretase-mediated low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) cleavage and degradation. To exploit this novel finding, we generated a liver-selective Nicastrin ASO, which recapitulated glucose and lipid improvements of L-Ncst mice, with increased levels of hepatocyte LDLR. Collectively, these results identify the role of hepatic \u03b3-secretase to regulate LDLR and suggest that liver-specific GSIs may simultaneously improve multiple aspects of the metabolic syndrome.",

In this work, we show that mice with liver-specific triple FoxO knockout (L-FoxO1,3,4), which are known to have reduced hepatic glucose production, also have increased HDL-C. This was associated with decreased expression of the HDL-C clearance factors scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and hepatic lipase and defective selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester by the liver. The phenotype could be rescued by re-expression of SR-BI. These findings demonstrate that hepatic FoxOs are required for cholesterol homeostasis and HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport to the liver.",

        "Abstract": "Pathophysiological, epidemiological, and genetic studies provide strong evidence that lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a causal mediator of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Specific therapies to address Lp(a)-mediated CVD and CAVD are in clinical development. Due to knowledge gaps, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute organized a working group that identified challenges in fully understanding the role of Lp(a) in CVD/CAVD. These included the lack of research funding, inadequate experimental models, lack of globally standardized Lp(a) assays, and inadequate understanding of the mechanisms underlying current drug therapies on Lp(a) levels. Specific recommendations were provided to facilitate basic, mechanistic, preclinical, and clinical research on Lp(a); foster collaborative research and resource sharing; leverage expertise of different groups and centers with complementary skills; and use existing National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute resources. Concerted efforts to understand Lp(a) pathophysiology, together with diagnostic and therapeutic advances, are required to reduce Lp(a)-mediated risk of CVD and CAVD.",

        "Abstract": "Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and dyslipidemia are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Fibrates are a class of drugs prescribed to treat dyslipidemia, but variation in response has been observed. To evaluate common and rare genetic variants that impact lipid responses to fenofibrate in statin-treated patients with T2D, we examined lipid changes in response to fenofibrate therapy using a genomewide association study (GWAS). Associations were followed-up using gene expression studies in mice. Common variants in SMAD3 and IPO11 were marginally associated with lipid changes in black subjects (P < 5 \u00d7 10",

        "Abstract": "Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the transfer of HDL cholesteryl esters for triglyceride (TG) in VLDL/LDL. CETP inhibition, with anacetrapib, increases HDL-cholesterol, reduces LDL-cholesterol, and lowers TG levels. This study describes the mechanisms responsible for TG lowering by examining the kinetics of VLDL-TG, apoC-II, apoC-III, and apoE. Mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects were randomized to either placebo (N = 10) or atorvastatin 20 mg/qd (N = 29) for 4 weeks (period 1) followed by 8 weeks of anacetrapib, 100 mg/qd (period 2). Following each period, subjects underwent stable isotope metabolic studies to determine the fractional catabolic rates (FCRs) and production rates (PRs) of VLDL-TG and plasma apoC-II, apoC-III, and apoE. Anacetrapib reduced the VLDL-TG pool on a statin background due to an increased VLDL-TG FCR (29%; ",

        "Abstract": "Retinoic acid, an active metabolite of dietary vitamin A, acts as a ligand for nuclear receptor transcription factors with more than 500 known target genes. It is becoming increasingly clear that alcohol has a significant impact on cellular retinoic acid metabolism, with resultant effects on its function. Here, we test the hypothesis that chronic alcohol consumption impairs retinoic acid signaling in brown adipose tissue (BAT), leading to impaired BAT function and thermoregulation. All studies were conducted in age-matched, male mice consuming alcohol-containing liquid diets. Alcohol's effect on BAT was assessed by histology, qPCR, HPLC, LC/MS and measures of core body temperature. Our data show that chronic alcohol consumption decreases BAT mass, with a resultant effect on thermoregulation. Follow-up mechanistic studies reveal a decreased triglyceride content in BAT, as well as impaired retinoic acid homeostasis, associated with decreased BAT levels of retinoic acid in alcohol-consuming mice. Our work highlights a hitherto uncharacterized effect of alcohol on BAT function, with possible implications for thermoregulation and energy metabolism in drinkers. Our data indicate that alcohol's effects on brown adipose tissue may be mediated through altered retinoic acid signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B100 (apoB). Although studies in mice and cells have identified increased hepatic LDL receptors as the basis for LDL lowering by PCSK9 inhibitors, there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on lipoprotein metabolism. In particular, it is not known whether inhibition of PCSK9 has any effects on very low-density lipoprotein or intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) metabolism. Inhibition of PCSK9 also results in reductions of plasma lipoprotein (a) levels. The regulation of plasma Lp(a) levels, including the role of LDL receptors in the clearance of Lp(a), is poorly defined, and no mechanistic studies of the Lp(a) lowering by alirocumab in humans have been published to date.",

We assessed the relationship between additional LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B100 reductions and MACE among patients within the ODYSSEY trials that compared alirocumab with controls (placebo/ezetimibe), mainly as add-on therapy to maximally tolerated statin.",

        "Abstract": "Inhibition of VLDL secretion reduces plasma levels of atherogenic apolipoprotein B (apoB) lipoproteins but can also cause hepatic steatosis. Approaches targeting apoB synthesis, which lies upstream of VLDL secretion, have potential to effectively reduce dyslipidemia but can also lead to hepatic accumulation of unsecreted triglycerides (TG). Here, we found that treating mice with apoB antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) for 6 weeks decreased VLDL secretion and plasma cholesterol without causing steatosis. The absence of steatosis was linked to an increase in ER stress in the first 3 weeks of ASO treatment, followed by development of ER autophagy at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. The latter resulted in increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation that was inhibited by both chloroquine and 3-methyl adenine, consistent with trafficking of ER TG through the autophagic pathway before oxidation. These findings support the concept that inhibition of apoB synthesis traps lipids that have been transferred to the ER by microsomal TG transfer protein (MTP), inducing ER stress. ER stress then triggers ER autophagy and subsequent lysosomal lipolysis of TG, followed by mitochondrial oxidation of released FA, leading to prevention of steatosis. The identification of this pathway indicates that inhibition of VLDL secretion remains a viable target for therapies aiming to reduce circulating levels of atherogenic apoB lipoproteins.",

        "Title": "Impaired postprandial lipemic response in chronic kidney disease.",
        "Abstract": "Dyslipidemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is usually characterized by hypertriglyceridemia. Here we studied postprandial lipemia in children and young adults to determine whether an increasing degree of CKD results in\u00a0a\u00a0proportional increase in triglyceride and chylomicron concentration. Secondary goals were to determine whether subnephrotic proteinuria, apolipoprotein (apo)C-III and insulin resistance modify the CKD effect. Eighteen fasting participants (mean age of 15 years, mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 50 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) underwent a\u00a0postprandial challenge with a high fat milkshake. Triglycerides, apoB-48, insulin, and other markers were measured before and 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours afterward. Response was assessed by the incremental area under the\u00a0curve of triglycerides and of apoB-48. The primary hypothesis was tested by correlation to estimated GFR. Significantly, for every 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2) lower estimated GFR, the incremental area under the curve of triglycerides was 17% greater while that of apoB-48 was 16% greater. Univariate analyses also showed that the incremental area\u00a0under the curve of triglycerides and apoB-48 were significantly associated with subnephrotic proteinuria, apoC-III, and insulin resistance. In multivariate analysis, CKD and insulin resistance were independently associated with increased area under the curve and were each linked\u00a0to increased levels of apoC-III. Thus, postprandial triglyceride and chylomicron plasma excursions are increased in direct proportion to the degree of CKD. Independent effects are associated with subclinical insulin resistance and increased apoC-III is linked to both CKD and\u00a0insulin resistance.",

        "Abstract": "Anacetrapib (ANA), an inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity, increases plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein A-I (apoA)-I, apoA-II, and CETP. The mechanisms responsible for these treatment-related increases in apolipoproteins and plasma CETP are unknown.

        "Title": "Complex effects of inhibiting hepatic apolipoprotein B100 synthesis in humans.",
        "Abstract": "Mipomersen is a 20mer antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that inhibits apolipoprotein B (apoB) synthesis; its low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering effects should therefore result from reduced secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). We enrolled 17 healthy volunteers who received placebo injections weekly for 3 weeks followed by mipomersen weekly for 7 to 9 weeks. Stable isotopes were used after each treatment to determine fractional catabolic rates and production rates of apoB in VLDL, IDL (intermediate-density lipoprotein), and LDL, and of triglycerides in VLDL. Mipomersen significantly reduced apoB in VLDL, IDL, and LDL, which was associated with increases in fractional catabolic rates of VLDL and LDL apoB and reductions in production rates of IDL and LDL apoB. Unexpectedly, the production rates of VLDL apoB and VLDL triglycerides were unaffected. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of apoB expression in human liver cells demonstrated preservation of apoB secretion across a range of apoB synthesis. Titrated ASO knockdown of apoB mRNA in chow-fed mice preserved both apoB and triglyceride secretion. In contrast, titrated ASO knockdown of apoB mRNA in high-fat-fed mice resulted in stepwise reductions in both apoB and triglyceride secretion. Mipomersen lowered all apoB lipoproteins without reducing the production rate of either VLDL apoB or triglyceride. Our human data are consistent with long-standing models of posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulation of apoB secretion and are supported by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Targeting apoB synthesis may lower levels of apoB lipoproteins without necessarily reducing VLDL secretion, thereby lowering the risk of steatosis associated with this therapeutic strategy.",

        "Abstract": "Pharmacological reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol using statin drugs is foundational therapy to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Here, we consider the place of nonstatin therapies that also reduce LDL cholesterol in prevention of CVD. Among conventional nonstatins, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials showed that bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and fibrates given as monotherapy each reduce CVD end points. From trials in which patients' LDL cholesterol was already well controlled on a statin, adding ezetimibe incrementally reduced CVD end points, whereas adding a fibrate or niacin showed no incremental benefit. Among emerging nonstatins, monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 added to a statin and given for \u226478 weeks showed preliminary evidence of reductions in CVD outcomes. Although these promising early findings contributed to the recent approval of these agents in Europe and in North America, much larger and longer duration outcomes studies are ongoing for definitive proof of CVD benefits. Other nonstatin agents recently approved in the United States include lomitapide and mipomersen, which both act via distinctive LDL receptor independent mechanisms to substantially reduce LDL cholesterol in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. We also address some unanswered questions, including measuring alternative biochemical variables to LDL cholesterol, evidence for treating children with monitoring of subclinical atherosclerosis, and potential risks of extremely low LDL cholesterol. As evidence for benefit in CVD prevention accumulates, we anticipate that clinical practice will shift toward more assertive LDL-lowering treatment, using both statins and nonstatins initiated earlier in appropriately selected patients.",

        "Title": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia in children and adolescents: gaining decades of life by optimizing detection and treatment.",
        "Abstract": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common genetic cause of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Globally, one baby is born with FH every minute. If diagnosed and treated early in childhood, individuals with FH can have normal life expectancy. This consensus paper aims to improve awareness of the need for early detection and management of FH children. Familial hypercholesterolaemia is diagnosed either on phenotypic criteria, i.e. an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level plus a family history of elevated LDL-C, premature coronary artery disease and/or genetic diagnosis, or positive genetic testing. Childhood is the optimal period for discrimination between FH and non-FH using LDL-C screening. An LDL-C \u22655 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), or an LDL-C \u22654 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) with family history of premature CHD and/or high baseline cholesterol in one parent, make the phenotypic diagnosis. If a parent has a genetic defect, the LDL-C cut-off for the child is \u22653.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). We recommend cascade screening of families using a combined phenotypic and genotypic strategy. In children, testing is recommended from age 5 years, or earlier if homozygous FH is suspected. A healthy lifestyle and statin treatment (from age 8 to 10 years) are the cornerstones of management of heterozygous FH. Target LDL-C is <3.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) if >10 years, or ideally 50% reduction from baseline if 8-10 years, especially with very high LDL-C, elevated lipoprotein(a), a family history of premature CHD or other cardiovascular risk factors, balanced against the long-term risk of treatment side effects. Identifying FH early and optimally lowering LDL-C over the lifespan reduces cumulative LDL-C burden and offers health and socioeconomic benefits. To drive policy change for timely detection and management, we call for further studies in the young. Increased awareness, early identification, and optimal treatment from childhood are critical to adding decades of healthy life for children and adolescents with FH.",

        "Abstract": "Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are one of the principal reasons for statin non-adherence and/or discontinuation, contributing to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Consensus Panel overviews current understanding of the pathophysiology of statin-associated myopathy, and provides guidance for diagnosis and management of SAMS. Statin-associated myopathy, with significant elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK), is a rare but serious side effect of statins, affecting 1 per 1000 to 1 per 10 000 people on standard statin doses. Statin-associated muscle symptoms cover a broader range of clinical presentations, usually with normal or minimally elevated CK levels, with a prevalence of 7-29% in registries and observational studies. Preclinical studies show that statins decrease mitochondrial function, attenuate energy production, and alter muscle protein degradation, thereby providing a potential link between statins and muscle symptoms; controlled mechanistic and genetic studies in humans are necessary to further understanding. The Panel proposes to identify SAMS by symptoms typical of statin myalgia (i.e. muscle pain or aching) and their temporal association with discontinuation and response to repetitive statin re-challenge. In people with SAMS, the Panel recommends the use of a maximally tolerated statin dose combined with non-statin lipid-lowering therapies to attain recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. The Panel recommends a structured work-up to identify individuals with clinically relevant SAMS generally to at least three different statins, so that they can be offered therapeutic regimens to satisfactorily address their cardiovascular risk. Further research into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms may offer future therapeutic potential.",

        "Abstract": "Autophagy is an essential cellular pathway by which protein aggregates, long-lived proteins, or defective organelles are sequestered in double membrane vesicles and then degraded upon fusion of those vesicles with lysosomes. Although autophagy plays a critical role in maintaining intracellular homeostasis and keeping the cell in a healthy state, this key pathway can become dysregulated in various cardiometabolic disorders, such as; obesity, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and insulin resistance. In these conditions, autophagy may actually worsen the pathological state instead of protecting the cell or organism. In this review, we discuss how dysregulated autophagy may be linked to increases in cardiovascular risk factors, and how manipulation of the autophagic machinery might reduce those risks.",

        "Abstract": "Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) catalyzes the final step in triglyceride synthesis, the conversion of diacylglycerol (DAG) to triglyceride. Dgat1(-/-) mice exhibit a number of beneficial metabolic effects including reduced obesity and improved insulin sensitivity and no known cardiac dysfunction. In contrast, failing human hearts have severely reduced DGAT1 expression associated with accumulation of DAGs and ceramides. To test whether DGAT1 loss alone affects heart function, we created cardiomyocyte-specific DGAT1 knock-out (hDgat1(-/-)) mice. hDgat1(-/-) mouse hearts had 95% increased DAG and 85% increased ceramides compared with floxed controls. 50% of these mice died by 9 months of age. The heart failure marker brain natriuretic peptide increased 5-fold in hDgat1(-/-) hearts, and fractional shortening (FS) was reduced. This was associated with increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 and cluster of differentiation 36. We crossed hDgat1(-/-) mice with previously described enterocyte-specific Dgat1 knock-out mice (hiDgat1(-/-)). This corrected the early mortality, improved FS, and reduced cardiac ceramide and DAG content. Treatment of hDgat1(-/-) mice with the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist exenatide also improved FS and reduced heart DAG and ceramide content. Increased fatty acid uptake into hDgat1(-/-) hearts was normalized by exenatide. Reduced activation of protein kinase C\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1), which is increased by DAG and ceramides, paralleled the reductions in these lipids. Our mouse studies show that loss of DGAT1 reproduces the lipid abnormalities seen in severe human heart failure.",

        "Abstract": "Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, with limited treatment options. This analysis evaluated the effect of a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9, alirocumab 150\u00a0mg every 2\u00a0weeks (Q2W), on Lp(a) levels in pooled data from 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 studies of 8 or 12\u00a0weeks' duration conducted in patients with hypercholesterolemia on background lipid-lowering therapy (NCT01266876, NCT01288469, and NCT01288443). Data were available for 102 of 108 patients who received alirocumab 150\u00a0mg Q2W and 74 of 77 patients who received placebo. Alirocumab resulted in a significant reduction in Lp(a) from baseline compared with placebo (-30.3% vs\u00a0-0.3%, p <0.0001). Median percentage Lp(a) reductions in the alirocumab group were of a similar magnitude across a range of baseline Lp(a) levels, resulting in greater absolute reductions in Lp(a) in patients with higher baseline levels. Regression analysis indicated that <5% of the variance in the reduction of Lp(a) was explained by the effect of alirocumab on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In conclusion, pooled data from 3 phase 2 trials demonstrate substantive reduction in Lp(a) with alirocumab 150\u00a0mg Q2W, including patients with baseline Lp(a) >50\u00a0mg/dl. Reductions in Lp(a) only weakly correlated with the magnitude of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering.",

        "Abstract": "Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) is a rare life-threatening condition characterized by markedly elevated circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and accelerated, premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD). Given recent insights into the heterogeneity of genetic defects and clinical phenotype of HoFH, and the availability of new therapeutic options, this Consensus Panel on Familial Hypercholesterolaemia of the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) critically reviewed available data with the aim of providing clinical guidance for the recognition and management of HoFH.",

Kinetic experiments with stable isotope tracers typically require laborious sample preparation and are most often used for studying abundant proteins. Here we describe a practical methodology for measuring isotope enrichment into low-abundance proteins that uses an automated procedure and immunoaffinity enrichment (IA) with LC-MS. Low-abundance plasma proteins cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) were studied as examples.",

        "Abstract": "Plasma triglyceride concentration is a biomarker for circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their metabolic remnants. Common mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridaemia is typically multigenic, and results from the cumulative burden of common and rare variants in more than 30 genes, as quantified by genetic risk scores. Rare autosomal recessive monogenic hypertriglyceridaemia can result from large-effect mutations in six different genes. Hypertriglyceridaemia is exacerbated by non-genetic factors. On the basis of recent genetic data, we redefine the disorder into two states: severe (triglyceride concentration >10 mmol/L), which is more likely to have a monogenic cause; and mild-to-moderate (triglyceride concentration 2-10 mmol/L). Because of clustering of susceptibility alleles and secondary factors in families, biochemical screening and counselling for family members is essential, but routine genetic testing is not warranted. Treatment includes management of lifestyle and secondary factors, and pharmacotherapy. In severe hypertriglyceridaemia, intervention is indicated because of pancreatitis risk; in mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridaemia, intervention can be indicated to prevent cardiovascular disease, dependent on triglyceride concentration, concomitant lipoprotein disturbances, and overall cardiovascular risk.",

        "Abstract": "LC/MS quantification of multiple plasma proteins that differ by several orders of magnitude in concentration from a single sample is challenging. We present a strategy that allows the simultaneous determination of the concentration and turnover kinetics of higher and lower abundant proteins from a single digestion mixture. Our attention was directed at a cluster of proteins that interact to affect the absorption and interorgan lipid trafficking. We demonstrate that apos involved in TG metabolism such as apoC2, C3, E, and A4 (micromolar concentration), and apoB48 and apoA5 (single-digit nanomolar concentration) can be quantified from a single digestion mixture. A high degree of correlation between LC/MS and immunobased measurements for apoC2, C3, E, and B48 was observed. Moreover, apoA5 fractional synthesis rate was measured in humans for the first time. Finally, the method can be directly applied to studies involving nonhuman primates because peptide sequences used in the method are conserved between humans and nonhuman primates.",

        "Title": "The combined hyperlipidemia caused by impaired Wnt-LRP6 signaling is reversed by Wnt3a rescue.",
        "Abstract": "The underlying molecular genetic basis of combined hyperlipidemia, the most common atherogenic lipid disorder, is poorly characterized. Rare, nonconservative mutations in the Wnt coreceptor, LRP6, underlie autosomal dominant atherosclerosis, combined hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver disease. Mice with LRP6(R611C) mutation similarly developed elevated plasma LDL and TG levels and fatty liver. Further investigation showed that LRP6(R611C) mutation triggers hepatic de novo lipogenesis, lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis, and apoB secretion by an Sp1-dependent activation of IGF1, AKT, and both mTORC1 and mTORC2. These pathways were normalized after in\u00a0vitro treatment of primary hepatocytes from LRP6(R611C) mice with either the IGF1R antagonist PPP, rapamycin, or rmWnt3a. Strikingly, in\u00a0vivo administration of rmWnt3a to LRP6(R611C) mice normalized the altered expression of enzymes of DNL and cholesterol biosynthesis, and restored plasma TG and LDL levels to normal. These findings identify Wnt signaling as a regulator of plasma lipids and a target for treatment of hyperlipidemia.",

        "Title": "Residual macrovascular risk in 2013: what have we learned?",
        "Abstract": "Cardiovascular disease poses a major challenge for the 21st century, exacerbated by the pandemics of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. While best standards of care, including high-dose statins, can ameliorate the risk of vascular complications, patients remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. The Residual Risk Reduction Initiative (R3i) has previously highlighted atherogenic dyslipidaemia, defined as the imbalance between proatherogenic triglyceride-rich apolipoprotein B-containing-lipoproteins and antiatherogenic apolipoprotein A-I-lipoproteins (as in high-density lipoprotein, HDL), as an important modifiable contributor to lipid-related residual cardiovascular risk, especially in insulin-resistant conditions. As part of its mission to improve awareness and clinical management of atherogenic dyslipidaemia, the R3i has identified three key priorities for action: i) to improve recognition of atherogenic dyslipidaemia in patients at high cardiometabolic risk with or without diabetes; ii) to improve implementation and adherence to guideline-based therapies; and iii) to improve therapeutic strategies for managing atherogenic dyslipidaemia. The R3i believes that monitoring of non-HDL cholesterol provides a simple, practical tool for treatment decisions regarding the management of lipid-related residual cardiovascular risk. Addition of a fibrate, niacin (North and South America), omega-3 fatty acids or ezetimibe are all options for combination with a statin to further reduce non-HDL cholesterol, although lacking in hard evidence for cardiovascular outcome benefits. Several emerging treatments may offer promise. These include the next generation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor\u03b1 agonists, cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors and monoclonal antibody therapy targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. However, long-term outcomes and safety data are clearly needed. In conclusion, the R3i believes that ongoing trials with these novel treatments may help to define the optimal management of atherogenic dyslipidaemia to reduce the clinical and socioeconomic burden of residual cardiovascular risk.",

        "Title": "Inhibition of Notch uncouples Akt activation from hepatic lipid accumulation by decreasing mTorc1 stability.",
        "Abstract": "Increased hepatic lipid content is an early correlate of insulin resistance and can be caused by nutrient-induced activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor). This activation of mTor increases basal Akt activity, leading to a self-perpetuating lipogenic cycle. We have previously shown that the developmental Notch pathway has metabolic functions in adult mouse liver. Acute or chronic inhibition of Notch dampens hepatic glucose production and increases Akt activity and may therefore be predicted to increase hepatic lipid content. Here we now show that constitutive liver-specific ablation of Notch signaling, or its acute inhibition with a decoy Notch1 receptor, prevents hepatosteatosis by blocking mTor complex 1 (mTorc1) activity. Conversely, Notch gain of function causes fatty liver through constitutive activation of mTorc1, an effect that is reversible by treatment with rapamycin. We demonstrate that Notch signaling increases mTorc1 complex stability, augmenting mTorc1 function and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1c (Srebp1c)-mediated lipogenesis. These data identify Notch as a therapeutically actionable branch point of metabolic signaling at which Akt activation in the liver can be uncoupled from hepatosteatosis.",

        "Abstract": "Apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] is the defining protein component of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The regulation of Lp(a) levels in blood is poorly understood in part due to technical challenges in measuring Lp(a) kinetics. Improvements in the ability to readily and reliably measure the kinetics of apo(a) using a stable isotope labeled tracer is expected to facilitate studies of the role of Lp(a) in cardiovascular disease. Since investigators typically determine the isotopic labeling of protein-bound amino acids following acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a protein of interest [e.g., apo(a)], studies of protein synthesis require extensive protein purification which limits throughput and often requires large sample volumes. We aimed to develop a rapid and efficient method for studying apo(a) kinetics that is suitable for use in studies involving human subjects.",

        "Title": "Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy.",
        "Abstract": "In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field.",

        "Abstract": "Acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 1 catalyzes the final step of triglyceride (TG) synthesis. We show that acute administration of a DGAT1 inhibitor (DGAT1i) by oral gavage or genetic deletion of intestinal Dgat1 (intestine-Dgat1(-/-)) markedly reduced postprandial plasma TG and retinyl ester excursions by inhibiting chylomicron secretion in mice. Loss of DGAT1 activity did not affect the efficiency of retinol esterification, but it did reduce TG and retinoid accumulation in the small intestine. In contrast, inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) reduced chylomicron secretion after oral fat/retinol loads, but with accumulation of dietary TG and retinoids in the small intestine. Lack of intestinal accumulation of TG and retinoids in DGAT1i-treated or intestine-Dgat1(-/-) mice resulted, in part, from delayed gastric emptying associated with increased plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1. However, neither bypassing the stomach through duodenal oil injection nor inhibiting the receptor for GLP-1 normalized postprandial TG or retinyl esters excursions in the absence of DGAT1 activity. In summary, intestinal DGAT1 inhibition or deficiency acutely delayed gastric emptying and inhibited chylomicron secretion; however, the latter occurred when gastric emptying was normal or when lipid was administered directly into the small intestine. Long-term hepatic retinoid metabolism was not impacted by DGAT1 inhibition.",

        "Abstract": "C-C motif chemokine receptor (CCR)2 and its ligand, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, are pivotal for adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) recruitment and the development of insulin resistance. However, other chemokine systems also may play a role in these processes. In this study, we investigated the role of CCR5 in obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. We analyzed expression levels of CCR5 and its ligands in white adipose tissue (WAT) of genetically (ob/ob) and high-fat (HF) diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Furthermore, we examined the metabolic phenotype of Ccr5(-/-) mice. CCR5 and its ligands were markedly upregulated in WAT of DIO and ob/ob mice. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis also revealed that DIO mice had a robust increase in CCR5(+) cells within ATMs compared with chow-fed mice. Furthermore, Ccr5(-/-) mice were protected from insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis induced by HF feeding. The effects of loss of CCR5 were related to both reduction of total ATM content and an M2-dominant shift in ATM polarization. It is noteworthy that transplantation of Ccr5(-/-) bone marrow was sufficient to protect against impaired glucose tolerance. CCR5 plays a critical role in ATM recruitment and polarization and subsequent development of insulin resistance.",

        "Title": "Activation of ER stress and mTORC1 suppresses hepatic sortilin-1 levels in obese mice.",
        "Abstract": "Recent GWAS have identified SNPs at a human chromosom1 locus associated with coronary artery disease risk and LDL cholesterol levels. The SNPs are also associated with altered expression of hepatic sortilin-1 (SORT1), which encodes a protein thought to be involved in apoB trafficking and degradation. Here, we investigated the regulation of Sort1 expression in mouse models of obesity. Sort1 expression was markedly repressed in both genetic (ob/ob) and high-fat diet models of obesity; restoration of hepatic sortilin-1 levels resulted in reduced triglyceride and apoB secretion. Mouse models of obesity also exhibit increased hepatic activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and ER stress, and we found that administration of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to ob/ob mice reduced ER stress and increased hepatic sortilin-1 levels. Conversely, genetically increased hepatic mTORC1 activity was associated with repressed Sort1 and increased apoB secretion. Treating WT mice with the ER stressor tunicamycin led to marked repression of hepatic sortilin-1 expression, while administration of the chemical chaperone PBA to ob/ob mice led to amelioration of ER stress, increased sortilin-1 expression, and reduced apoB and triglyceride secretion. Moreover, the ER stress target Atf3 acted at the SORT1 promoter region as a transcriptional repressor, whereas knockdown of Atf3 mRNA in ob/ob mice led to increased hepatic sortilin-1 levels and decreased apoB and triglyceride secretion. Thus, in mouse models of obesity, induction of mTORC1 and ER stress led to repression of hepatic Sort1 and increased VLDL secretion via Atf3. This pathway may contribute to dyslipidemia in metabolic disease.",

        "Abstract": "We recently reported that inhibition of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11\u03b2-HSD1) by antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) improved hepatic lipid metabolism independent of food intake. In that study, 11\u03b2-HSD1 ASO-treated mice lost weight compared with food-matched control ASO-treated mice, suggesting treatment-mediated increased energy expenditure. We have now examined the effects of 11\u03b2-HSD1 ASO treatment on adipose tissue metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and whole-body energy expenditure. We used an ASO to knock down 11\u03b2-HSD1 in C57BL/6J mice consuming a Western-type diet (WTD). The 11\u03b2-HSD1 ASO-treated mice consumed less food, so food-matched control ASO-treated mice were also evaluated. We characterized body composition, gene expression of individual adipose depots, and measures of energy metabolism. We also investigated glucose/insulin tolerance as well as acute insulin signaling in several tissues. Knockdown of 11\u03b2-HSD1 protected against WTD-induced obesity by reducing epididymal, mesenteric, and subcutaneous white adipose tissue while activating thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. The latter was confirmed by demonstrating increased energy expenditure in 11\u03b2-HSD1 ASO-treated mice. The 11\u03b2-HSD1 ASO treatment also protected against WTD-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance; this protection was associated with smaller cells and fewer macrophages in epididymal white adipose tissue as well as enhanced in vivo insulin signaling. Our results indicate that ASO-mediated inhibition of 11\u03b2-HSD1 can protect against several WTD-induced metabolic abnormalities. These effects are, at least in part, mediated by increases in the oxidative capacity of brown adipose tissue.",

        "Title": "Different fatty acids inhibit apoB100 secretion by different pathways: unique roles for ER stress, ceramide, and autophagy.",
        "Abstract": "Although short-term incubation of hepatocytes with oleic acid (OA) stimulates secretion of apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100), exposure to higher doses of OA for longer periods inhibits secretion in association with induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Palmitic acid (PA) induces ER stress, but its effects on apoB100 secretion are unclear. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibits apoB100 secretion, but its effects on ER stress have not been studied. We compared the effects of each of these fatty acids on ER stress and apoB100 secretion in McArdle RH7777 (McA) cells: OA and PA induced ER stress and inhibited apoB100 secretion at higher doses; PA was more potent because it also increased the synthesis of ceramide. DHA did not induce ER stress but was the most potent inhibitor of apoB100 secretion, acting via stimulation of autophagy. These unique effects of each fatty acid were confirmed when they were infused into C57BL6J mice. Our results suggest that when both increased hepatic secretion of VLDL apoB100 and hepatic steatosis coexist, reducing ER stress might alleviate hepatic steatosis but at the expense of increased VLDL secretion. In contrast, increasing autophagy might reduce VLDL secretion without causing steatosis.",

IR is associated with increased secretion of VLDL and increased plasma triglycerides, as well as with hepatic steatosis, despite the increased VLDL secretion. Here we link IR with increased VLDL secretion and hepatic steatosis at both the physiologic and molecular levels. Increased VLDL secretion, together with the downstream effects on high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) size, is proatherogenic. Hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. Understanding the complex inter-relationships between IR and these abnormalities of liver lipid homeostasis will provide insights relevant to new therapies for these increasing clinical problems.",

        "Abstract": "Even at low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal, patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. This paper aims (i) to critically appraise evidence for elevated levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as cardiovascular risk factors, and (ii) to advise on therapeutic strategies for management. Current evidence supports a causal association between elevated TRL and their remnants, low HDL-C, and cardiovascular risk. This interpretation is based on mechanistic and genetic studies for TRL and remnants, together with the epidemiological data suggestive of the association for circulating triglycerides and cardiovascular disease. For HDL, epidemiological, mechanistic, and clinical intervention data are consistent with the view that low HDL-C contributes to elevated cardiovascular risk; genetic evidence is unclear however, potentially reflecting the complexity of HDL metabolism. The Panel believes that therapeutic targeting of elevated triglycerides (\u2265 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL), a marker of TRL and their remnants, and/or low HDL-C (<1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) may provide further benefit. The first step should be lifestyle interventions together with consideration of compliance with pharmacotherapy and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia. If inadequately corrected, adding niacin or a fibrate, or intensifying LDL-C lowering therapy may be considered. Treatment decisions regarding statin combination therapy should take into account relevant safety concerns, i.e. the risk of elevation of blood glucose, uric acid or liver enzymes with niacin, and myopathy, increased serum creatinine and cholelithiasis with fibrates. These recommendations will facilitate reduction in the substantial cardiovascular risk that persists in patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities at LDL-C goal.",

        "Abstract": "11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11\u03b2-HSD1) converts inactive 11-keto derivatives to active glucocorticoids within tissues and may play a role in the metabolic syndrome (MS). We used an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to knock down 11\u03b2-HSD1 in livers of C57BL/6J mice consuming a Western-type diet (WTD). 11\u03b2-HSD1 ASO-treated mice consumed less food, so we compared them to ad libitum-fed mice and to food-matched mice receiving control ASO. Knockdown of 11\u03b2-HSD1 directly protected mice from WTD-induced steatosis and dyslipidemia by reducing synthesis and secretion of triglyceride (TG) and increasing hepatic fatty acid oxidation. These changes in hepatic and plasma lipids were not associated with reductions in genes involved in de novo lipogenesis. However, protein levels of both sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1 and fatty acid synthase were significantly reduced in mice treated with 11\u03b2-HSD1 ASO. There was no change in hepatic secretion of apolipoprotein (apo)B, indicating assembly and secretion of smaller apoB-containing lipoproteins by the liver in the 11\u03b2-HSD1-treated mice. Our results indicate that inhibition of 11\u03b2-HSD1 by ASO treatment of WTD-fed mice resulted in improved plasma and hepatic lipid levels, reduced lipogenesis by posttranslational regulation, and secretion of similar numbers of apoB-containing lipoproteins containing less TG per particle.",

        "Abstract": "Diacylglycerol (DAG) acyl transferase 1 (Dgat1) knockout ((-/-)) mice are resistant to high-fat-induced obesity and insulin resistance, but the reasons are unclear. Dgat1(-/-) mice had reduced mRNA levels of all three Ppar genes and genes involved in fatty acid oxidation in the myocardium of Dgat1(-/-) mice. Although DGAT1 converts DAG to triglyceride (TG), tissue levels of DAG were not increased in Dgat1(-/-) mice. Hearts of chow-diet Dgat1(-/-) mice were larger than those of wild-type (WT) mice, but cardiac function was normal. Skeletal muscles from Dgat1(-/-) mice were also larger. Muscle hypertrophy factors phospho-AKT and phospho-mTOR were increased in Dgat1(-/-) cardiac and skeletal muscle. In contrast to muscle, liver from Dgat1(-/-) mice had no reduction in mRNA levels of genes mediating fatty acid oxidation. Glucose uptake was increased in cardiac and skeletal muscle in Dgat1(-/-) mice. Treatment with an inhibitor specific for DGAT1 led to similarly striking reductions in mRNA levels of genes mediating fatty acid oxidation in cardiac and skeletal muscle. These changes were reproduced in cultured myocytes with the DGAT1 inhibitor, which also blocked the increase in mRNA levels of Ppar genes and their targets induced by palmitic acid. Thus, loss of DGAT1 activity in muscles decreases mRNA levels of genes involved in lipid uptake and oxidation.",

Experimental sleep restriction has been shown to significantly increase total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels in women. Short sleep duration has been found in cross sectional studies to be associated with higher total cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol levels. Sleep deprivation could increase the risk for hypercholesterolemia by increasing appetite and dietary consumption of saturated fats, decreasing motivation to engage in regular physical activity, and increasing stress and resultant catecholamine induced lipolysis. No previous published population studies have examined the longitudinal relationship between sleep duration and high cholesterol.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity induces a program of systemic inflammation that is implicated in the development of many of its clinical sequelae. Hepatic inflammation is a feature of obesity-induced liver disease, and our previous studies demonstrated reduced hepatic steatosis in obese mice deficient in the C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) that regulates myeloid cell recruitment. This suggests that a myeloid cell population is recruited to the liver in obesity and contributes to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.",

        "Abstract": "The goal of this study was to determine if individuals with coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) had greater endothelial dysfunction (ED) than individuals with only CAD. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), calculated as percentage increase in brachial artery diameter in response to postischemic blood flow, was measured after an overnight fast in 2 cohorts. The first cohort included 76 participants in the Northern Manhattan Study with CAD; 25 also had T2DM. The second cohort was composed of 27 individuals with both T2DM and CAD who were participants in a study of postprandial lipemia. Combined, we analyzed 103 patients with CAD: 52 with T2DM (T2DM+) and 51 without T2DM (T2DM-). The 52 CAD T2DM+ subjects had a mean FMD of 3.9% +/- 3.2%, whereas the 51 CAD T2DM- subjects had a greater mean FMD of 5.5% +/- 4.0% (P < .03). An investigation of various confounders known to affect FMD identified age and body mass index as the only significant covariates in a multiple regression model. Adjusting for age and body mass index, we found that FMD remained lower in T2DM+ subjects compared with T2DM- subjects (difference, -1.99%; P < .03). In patients with CAD, the concomitant presence of T2DM is independently associated with greater ED, as measured by FMD. This finding may be relevant to the greater early and late morbidity and mortality observed in patients with both CAD and T2DM.",

(c)2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Strategies for the effective management of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with the metabolic syndrome (MS) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are essential to help reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Treatment strategies should be multifactorial and include the promotion of therapeutic lifestyle changes, as well as pharmacologic therapies to treat individual risk factors according to current guidelines. In an accompanying article, the importance of atherogenic dyslipidemia as a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with MS or T2DM was highlighted. Current treatment options for managing this characteristic form of atherogenic dyslipidemia are limited and tend to be only moderately effective. The focus of this review is the current pharmacotherapies available for the management of atherogenic dyslipidemia in patients with the MS or T2DM, highlighting the rationale for combining available treatments. Novel strategies currently in clinical development are also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Both the metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) confer an increased risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease (CVD). As MS and T2DM become more prevalent, there will be an associated rise in the number of individuals with or at risk for CVD and its related disorders. One major underlying cause of CVD in patients with MS or T2DM is a characteristic form of atherogenic dyslipidemia. This article reviews the evidence that demonstrates that individuals with MS or T2DM are at increased risk for CVD and highlights atherogenic dyslipidemia as an important risk factor for the development of CVD in these individuals. In an accompanying article, current pharmacotherapies available for the management of atherogenic dyslipidemia in individuals with MS or T2DM are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) characteristically have elevated fasting and postprandial (PP) plasma triglycerides (TG). Previous case-control studies indicated that PPTG levels predict the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in people without DM; however, the data for patients with DM are conflicting. Therefore, we conducted a case-control study in DM individuals, 84 with (+) and 80 without (-) CAD. Our hypothesis was that DM individuals with or without CAD would have similar PPTG levels, but CAD+ individuals would have more small d<1.006 g/L lipoprotein particles. Several markers of PP lipid metabolism were measured over 10 h after a fat load. PP lipoprotein size and particle number were also determined. There was no significant difference in any measure of PP lipid metabolism between CAD+ and CAD-, except for apoB48, which was actually higher in CAD-. We followed 69 CAD- participants for a mean 8.7 years; 33 remained free of any cardiovascular event. There were no PP differences at baseline between these 33 who remained CAD- and either the 36 original CAD- who subsequently developed CAD or the original CAD+ group.PP measurements of TG-rich lipoproteins do not predict the presence of CAD in individuals with DM.",

        "Abstract": "Despite achieving targets for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycemia in accordance with current standards of care, patients with dyslipidemia remain at high residual risk of vascular events. Atherogenic dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, often with elevated apolipoprotein B and non-HDL cholesterol, is common in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome and contributes to both macrovascular and microvascular residual risk. However, atherogenic dyslipidemia is largely underdiagnosed and undertreated in clinical practice. The Residual Risk Reduction Initiative (R3i) was established to address this highly relevant clinical issue. The aims of this position paper are (1) to highlight evidence that atherogenic dyslipidemia is associated with residual macrovascular and microvascular risk in patients at high risk for CVD, despite current standards of care for dyslipidemia and diabetes; and (2) to recommend therapeutic intervention for reducing this residual vascular risk supported by evidence and expert consensus. Lifestyle modification with nutrition and exercise is an important, effective, and underutilized first step in reducing residual vascular risk. Therapeutic intervention aimed at achievement of all lipid targets is also often required. Combination lipid-modifying therapy, with the addition of niacin, a fibrate, or omega-3 fatty acids to statin therapy, increases the probability of achieving all lipid goals. Outcomes studies are in progress to evaluate whether these combination treatment strategies translate to a clinical benefit greater than that achieved with statins alone. The R3i highlights the need to address with lifestyle and/or pharmacotherapy the high level of residual risk of CVD events and microvascular complications among patients with dyslipidemia receiving therapy for high levels of LDL cholesterol and for diabetes in accordance with current standards of care.",

Therefore, it is not surprising that the assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the small intestine and liver is a highly regulated process. In particular, cotranslational and posttranslational targeting of apoB for degradation, regulated largely by the availability of the core lipids carried in the lipoprotein, by the types of dietary fatty acids consumed, and by the hormonal milieu, determines the number of chylomicrons or VLDL that are secreted. In this review, we summarize both older and more recent findings on the pathways of apoB degradation, focusing on events in the liver.",

        "Abstract": "Despite current standards of care aimed at achieving targets for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, blood pressure and glycaemia, dyslipidaemic patients remain at high residual risk of vascular events. Atherogenic dyslipidaemia, specifically elevated triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, often with elevated apolipoprotein B and non-HDL cholesterol, is common in patients with established cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity or metabolic syndrome and is associated with macrovascular and microvascular residual risk. The Residual Risk Reduction Initiative (R3I) was established to address this important issue. This position paper aims to highlight evidence that atherogenic dyslipidaemia contributes to residual macrovascular risk and microvascular complications despite current standards of care for dyslipidaemia and diabetes, and to recommend therapeutic intervention for reducing this, supported by evidence and expert consensus. Lifestyle modification is an important first step. Additionally, pharmacotherapy is often required. Adding niacin, a fibrate or omega-3 fatty acids to statin therapy improves achievement of all lipid risk factors. Outcomes studies are evaluating whether these strategies translate to greater clinical benefit than statin therapy alone. In conclusion, the R3I highlights the need to address with lifestyle and/or pharmacotherapy the high level of residual vascular risk among dyslipidaemic patients who are treated in accordance with current standards of care.",

        "Abstract": "Combination therapy for the treatment of dyslipidemia and reduction of cardiovascular risk has been demonstrated to beneficially modify the lipid profile in multiple randomized clinical trials. As reported in the updated National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol remains the primary treatment target, although the comprehensive management of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients includes the modification of secondary lipid parameters such as triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although statin therapy is the standard intervention for lowering LDL cholesterol, combination therapy has demonstrated added benefits on secondary lipid parameters and enhances statin-mediated reductions in LDL cholesterol. The benefits of modifying these secondary targets on all-cause or cardiovascular event-related mortality are currently under investigation in several clinical trials. Prescription omega-3 fatty acid (Lovaza) is a formulation of 2 highly purified omega-3-acid ethyl esters, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. The recently completed Combination of Prescription Omega-3 With Simvastatin (COMBOS) study confirmed that prescription omega-3 fatty acid administered in combination with simvastatin achieves statistically significant improvements across a range of lipid indicators beyond the LDL primary target, including triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lipoprotein particle size. In conclusion, several classes of drugs, including omega-3 fatty acids, can be used in combination with statins to achieve more global improvements in lipid profiles.",

        "Abstract": "Although low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established atherogenic factor for coronary heart disease, it does not completely represent the risk associated with atherogenic lipoproteins in the presence of high triglyceride (TG) levels. Constituent lipoproteins constituting non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) include atherogenic TG-rich lipoproteins, cholesteryl ester-enriched remnants of TG-rich lipoproteins, and lipoprotein(a). Recent observational and intervention studies suggest that the predictive value of non-HDL-C for cardiovascular risk and mortality is better than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and that non-HDL-C correlates highly with plasma apolipoprotein B levels. Currently, the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines identify non-HDL-C as a secondary target of therapy in patients with TG elevation (> or =200 mg/dl) after the attainment of LDL-C target goals. In patients with coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease risk equivalents, an optional non-HDL-C goal is <100 mg/dl. To achieve the non-HDL-C goal, statin therapy may be intensified or combined with ezetimibe, niacin, a fibrate, or omega-3 fatty acids. In conclusion, non-HDL-C remains an important target of therapy for patients with elevated TGs, although its widespread adoption has yet to gain a foothold among health care professionals treating patients with dyslipidemia.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin resistance plays a central role in the development of the metabolic syndrome, but how it relates to cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Liver insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mice have pure hepatic insulin resistance. On a standard chow diet, LIRKO mice have a proatherogenic lipoprotein profile with reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles that are markedly enriched in cholesterol. This is due to increased secretion and decreased clearance of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, coupled with decreased triglyceride secretion secondary to increased expression of Pgc-1 beta (Ppargc-1b), which promotes VLDL secretion, but decreased expression of Srebp-1c (Srebf1), Srebp-2 (Srebf2), and their targets, the lipogenic enzymes and the LDL receptor. Within 12 weeks on an atherogenic diet, LIRKO mice show marked hypercholesterolemia, and 100% of LIRKO mice, but 0% of controls, develop severe atherosclerosis. Thus, insulin resistance at the level of the liver is sufficient to produce the dyslipidemia and increased risk of atherosclerosis associated with the metabolic syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is common in individuals with insulin resistance, and diets enriched in 1,3-diacylglycerol (DAG) may reduce postprandial plasma triglycerides (PPTGs). We enrolled 25 insulin-resistant, nondiabetic individuals in a double-blind, randomized crossover trial to test the acute and chronic effects of a DAG-enriched diet on PPTG. Participants received either DAG or triacylglycerol (TAG) oil, in food products, for 5 weeks. Fasting lipids, and two separate postprandial tests, one with DAG oil and one with TAG oil, were performed at the end of each 5 week diet period. We found no acute or chronic effects of DAG oil on PPTG. Thus, neither the DAG oil PPTG (h/mg/dl) on a chronic TAG diet [area under the curve (AUC) = 503 +/- 439] nor the TAG oil PPTG on a chronic DAG diet (AUC = 517 +/- 638) was different from the TAG oil PPTG on a chronic TAG diet (AUC = 565 +/- 362). Five weeks of a DAG-enriched diet had no acute or chronic effects on PPTG in insulin-resistant individuals. We suggest further studies to evaluate the effects of DAG on individuals with low and high TG levels.",

        "Abstract": "ER stress can cause hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Increased VLDL secretion could protect the liver from ER stress-induced steatosis, but the effect of lipid-induced ER stress on the secretion of VLDL is unknown. To determine the effect of lipids on hepatic ER stress and VLDL secretion, we treated McA-RH7777 liver cells with free fatty acids. Prolonged exposure increased cell triglycerides, induced steatosis, and increased ER stress. Effects on apoB100 secretion, which is required for VLDL assembly, were parabolic, with moderate free fatty acid exposure increasing apoB100 secretion, while greater lipid loading inhibited apoB100 secretion. This decreased secretion at higher lipid levels was due to increased protein degradation through both proteasomal and nonproteasomal pathways and was dependent on the induction of ER stress. These findings were supported in vivo, where intravenous infusion of oleic acid (OA) in mice increased ER stress in a duration-dependent manner. apoB secretion was again parabolic, stimulated by moderate, but not prolonged, OA infusion. Inhibition of ER stress was able to restore OA-stimulated apoB secretion after prolonged OA infusion. These results suggest that excessive ER stress in response to increased hepatic lipids may decrease the ability of the liver to secrete triglycerides by limiting apoB secretion, potentially worsening steatosis.",

        "Abstract": "To investigate the effect of dietary 1,3-diacylglycerol (DAG) on the development of insulin resistance (IR) and obesity, brown adipose tissue-deficient mice, a model of high-fat diet-induced IR and obesity, were fed Western-type diets (WTD) containing either DAG oil (n = 8) or standard triacylglycerol (TAG) oil (n = 9) for 15 weeks, beginning at 8 weeks of age. Although brown adipose tissue-deficient mice became obese on both TAG- and DAG-enriched WTD (TAG-WTD and DAG-WTD), the mice eating DAG-WTD gained less weight and had less body fat accumulation. The results of glucose tolerance tests conducted after 5 weeks of each WTD were not different. However, after 10 weeks of each WTD, impaired glucose tolerance developed in the TAG-WTD group but was prevented by DAG-WTD. Exploratory analyses of gene expression suggested that consumption of DAG-WTD was associated with reduced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression in liver and increased expression of the genes for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, lipoprotein lipase, and uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 in skeletal muscle. There were no effects of the DAG-WTD on fasting and postprandial plasma triglyceride (TG) levels, hepatic TG content, or the rate of secretion of TG from the liver. These findings suggest that diets enriched in 1,3-DAG oil may reduce WTD-induced IR and body fat accumulation by suppressing gluconeogenesis in liver and stimulating fat oxidation in skeletal muscle.",

        "Abstract": "The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) lipid trial aims to test whether a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) plus a fibrate is more efficacious in reducing cardiovascular events than a statin plus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with defined glycemic control. This is a blinded component in a 5,518-patient subset of the ACCORD cohort. These participants were randomized to either be (1) treated with simvastatin (titrated to 40 mg/day if necessary to achieve a goal low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol level of <2.59 mmol/L [100 mg/dL]) plus placebo or (2) treated to the same goal LDL cholesterol level with the statin plus active fenofibrate 160 mg/day or its bioequivalent (or 54 mg/day if the estimated glomerular filtration rate ranges from 30 to <50 mL/min per 1.73 m2). Setting an upper limit of LDL cholesterol qualifying for randomization excluded patients who would not likely achieve the LDL cholesterol goal. Recruitment for ACCORD began in January 2001, and follow-up is scheduled to end in June 2009. Since recruitment began, several clinical trials and consensus statements have been published that led to changes in the details of the lipid treatment algorithm and protocol. This report describes the design of the lipid protocol and modifications to the protocol during the course of the study in response to and in anticipation of these developments. The current protocol is designed to provide an ethically justifiable test of combined statin plus fibrate treatment consistent with the highest level of safety and lipid treatment standards of care.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus die of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at rates 2-4 times higher than patients without diabetes but with similar demographic characteristics. The prevalence of diabetes is increasing in the United States and, thus, the prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes poses an urgent public health challenge. The objective of this report is to review the current knowledge base for the prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes, with particular emphasis on the control of glycemia, lipids, and blood pressure. Epidemiologic analyses suggest that each 1% increase in glycosylated hemoglobin increases the risk for CVD by approximately 18%; however, evidence from the randomized trials that have examined whether glucose lowering reduces this risk is conflicting. Randomized trials have shown that lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduces CVD event rates by 17%-43% in patients with diabetes. Limited data support a role for lowering triglycerides and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the prevention of CVD. Evidence from clinical trials shows that reducing systolic blood pressure to <140 mm Hg results in 30%-60% reductions in CVD events; however, epidemiologic evidence suggests that lowering to optimal systolic blood pressure levels (<120 mm Hg) may be additionally beneficial. Important questions regarding prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes remain unresolved, including the benefits of near-normal glycemic control, comprehensive therapy for diabetes-related dyslipidemia, and optimal blood pressure control. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial will test hypotheses to address these unanswered questions.",

        "Abstract": "Most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus develop cardiovascular disease (CVD), with substantial loss of life expectancy. Nonfatal CVD contributes greatly to excess healthcare costs and decreased quality of life in patients with diabetes. The current epidemic of obesity has raised expectations that CVD associated with type 2 diabetes will become an even greater public health challenge. Despite the importance of this health problem, there is a lack of definitive data on the effects of the intensive control of glycemia and other CVD risk factors on CVD event rates in patients with type 2 diabetes. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial is a randomized, multicenter, double 2 x 2 factorial design study involving 10,251 middle-aged and older participants with type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for CVD events because of existing CVD or additional risk factors. ACCORD is testing the effects of 3 medical treatment strategies to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality. All participants are in the glycemia trial, which is testing the hypothesis that a therapeutic strategy that targets a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of <6.0% will reduce the rate of CVD events more than a strategy that targets an HbA1c level of 7.0%-7.9%. The lipid trial includes 5,518 of the participants, who receive either fenofibrate or placebo in a double-masked fashion to test the hypothesis of whether, in the context of good glycemic control, a therapeutic strategy that uses a fibrate to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels together with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol will reduce the rate of CVD events compared with a strategy that uses a statin plus a placebo. The blood pressure trial includes the remaining 4,733 participants and tests the hypothesis that a therapeutic strategy that targets a systolic blood pressure of <120 mm Hg in the context of good glycemic control will reduce the rate of CVD events compared with a strategy that targets a systolic blood pressure of <140 mm Hg. The primary outcome measure for all 3 research questions is the first occurrence of a major CVD event, specifically nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Upon the expected completion of participant follow-up in 2009, the ACCORD trial should document for the first time the benefits and risks of intensive glucose control, intensive blood pressure control, and the combination of fibrate and statin drugs in managing blood lipids in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes.",

        "Title": "Lipoprotein metabolism in chronic renal insufficiency.",
        "Abstract": "Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) is associated with a characteristic dyslipidemia. Findings in children with CRI largely parallel those in adults. Moderate hypertriglyceridemia, increased triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and reduced high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are the most usual findings, whereas total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) remain normal or modestly increased. Qualitative abnormalities in lipoproteins are common, including small dense LDL, oxidized LDL, and cholesterol-enriched TRL. Measures of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activity are reduced, and concentrations of apolipoprotein C-III are markedly elevated. Still an active area of research, major pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the dyslipidemia of CRI include insulin resistance and nonnephrotic proteinuria. Sources of variability in the severity of this dyslipidemia include the degree of renal impairment and the modality of dialysis. The benefits of maintaining normal body weight and physical activity extend to those with CRI. In addition to multiple hypolipidemic pharmaceuticals, fish oils are also effective as a triglyceride-lowering agent, and the phosphorous binding agent sevelamer also lowers LDL-C. Emerging classes of hypolipidemic agents and drugs affecting sensitivity to insulin may impact future treatment. Unfortunately, cardiovascular benefit has not been convincingly demonstrated by any trial designed to study adults or children with renal disease. Therefore, it is not possible at this time to endorse general recommendations for the use of any agent to treat dyslipidemia in children with chronic kidney disease.",

        "Abstract": "Prior studies have suggested that FAs liberated in the small intestine from ingested 1,3-diacylglycerol (DAG) are inefficiently incorporated into triglyceride (TG) in enterocytes, with less chylomicron TG entering the circulation postprandially. We found less TG, but more monacylglyerol and DAG, with similar total acylglycerol in newly secreted chylomicrons after oral DAG or triacylglycerol (TAG). However, clearance of DAG-chylomicrons was more rapid than that of TAG-chylomicrons; this was associated with more efficient in vitro LPL-mediated lipolysis of DAG-derived chylomicrons. Intravenously infused DAG was also cleared faster than TAG in normal mice, via both LPL-mediated lipolysis and apolipoprotein E (apoE)-dependent hepatic uptake. Infusions of TAG, but not DAG, increased plasma TG levels. Greater delivery of DAG-derived FA to the liver during infusion of DAG led to greater TG secretion versus TAG; this allowed the maintenance of similar hepatic TG levels after DAG and TAG infusions. Of note, apoB secretion was similar after DAG versus TAG, indicating the assembly of larger very low density lipoproteins after DAG. In conclusion, reduced plasma TG levels, after oral or intravenous DAG, result from more efficient clearance of DAG by both LPL lipolysis and apoE-mediated hepatic endocytosis. DAG emulsions may by useful for intravenous nutrition in people with preexisting hypertriglyceridemia.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin-resistant apoB/BATless mice have hypertriglyceridemia because of increased assembly and secretion of very low density apolipoprotein B (apoB) and triglycerides compared with mice expressing only apoB (Siri, P., Candela, N., Ko, C., Zhang, Y., Eusufzai, S., Ginsberg, H. N., and Huang, L. S. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 46064-46072). Despite increased very low density lipoprotein secretion, apoB/BATless mice have fatty livers. We found that hepatic mRNA levels of key lipogenic enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty-acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 were increased in apoB/BATless mice compared with levels in apoB mice, suggesting increased lipogenesis in apoB/BATless mice. This was confirmed by determining incorporation of tritiated water into fatty acids. Neither the hepatic mRNA of the lipogenic transcription factor, SREBP-1c (sterol-response element-binding protein 1c), nor the nuclear levels of the mature form of SREBP-1 protein were elevated in apoB/BATless mice. By contrast, hepatic levels of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor 2 (PPARgamma2) mRNA and protein were specifically increased in apoB/BATless mice, as were hepatic mRNA levels of two targets of PPARgamma, CD36 and aP2. Treatment of apoB/BATless mice for 4 weeks with intraperitoneal injections of a PPARgamma antisense oligonucleotide resulted in dramatic reductions of both PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma2 mRNA, PPARgamma2 protein, and mRNA levels of fatty-acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. These changes were associated with decreased hepatic de novo lipogenesis and hepatic triglyceride concentrations. We conclude that hepatic steatosis in apoB/BATless mice is associated with elevated rates of hepatic lipogenesis that are linked directly to increased hepatic expression of PPARgamma2. The mechanism whereby hepatic Ppargamma2 gene expression is increased and how PPARgamma2 stimulates lipogenesis is under investigation.",

A complex dyslipidemia, which is an integral part of the underlying insulin resistance in this group, is a key to this increased risk.

        "Title": "Translocation efficiency of apolipoprotein B is determined by the presence of beta-sheet domains, not pause transfer sequences.",
        "Abstract": "Cotranslational translocation of apoB100 across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is inefficient, resulting in exposure of nascent apoB on the cytosolic surface of the ER. This predisposes apoB100 to ubiquitinylation and targeting for proteasomal degradation. It has been suggested that pause transfer sequences (PTS) present throughout apoB cause inefficient translocation. On the other hand, our previous study demonstrated that the translocation efficiency of apoB100 is dependent on the presence of a beta-sheet domain between 29 and 34% of full-length apoB100 (Liang, J.-S., Wu, X., Jiang, H., Zhou, M., Yang, H., Angkeow, P., Huang, L.-S., Sturley, S. L., and Ginsberg, H. N. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 35216-35221); this region of apoB has no PTS. However, the effects of the beta-sheet domain may require the presence of PTS elsewhere in the N-terminal region of apoB100. To further investigate the roles of PTS and beta-sheet domains in the translocation of apoB100 across the ER, we transfected McArdle RH7777, HepG2, or Chinese hamster ovary cells with human albumin (ALB)/human apoB chimeric cDNA constructs: ALB/B12-17 (two PTS but no beta-sheet), ALB/B29-34 (beta-sheet but no PTS), ALB/B36-41 (two PTS and a beta-sheet), and ALB/B49-54 (neither PTS nor a beta-sheet). ALB/ALB1-40 served as a control. Compared with ALB/ALB1-40, secretion rates of ALB/B12-17, ALB/B29-34, and ALB/B36-41 were reduced. Secretion of ALB/B49-54 was similar to that of ALB/ALB1-40. However, only ALB/B29-34 and ALB/B36-41 had increased proteinase K sensitivity, ubiquitinylation, and increased physical interaction with Sec61alpha. These results indicate that the translocation efficiency of apoB100 is determined mainly by the presence of beta-sheet domains. PTS do not appear to affect translocation, but may affect secretion by other mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin resistance is often associated with obesity. We tested whether augmentation of triglyceride synthesis in adipose tissue by transgenic overexpression of the diacylglycerol aclytransferase-1 (Dgat1) gene causes obesity and/or alters insulin sensitivity. Male FVB mice expressing the aP2-Dgat1 had threefold more Dgat1 mRNA and twofold greater DGAT activity levels in adipose tissue. After 30 weeks of age, these mice had hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance on a high-fat diet but were not more obese than wild-type littermates. Compared with control littermates, Dgat1 transgenic mice were both insulin and leptin resistant and had markedly elevated plasma free fatty acid levels. Adipocytes from Dgat1 transgenic mice displayed increased basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis rates and decreased gene expression for fatty acid uptake. Muscle triglyceride content was unaffected, but liver mass and triglyceride content were increased by 20 and 300%, respectively. Hepatic insulin signaling was suppressed, as evidenced by decreased phosphorylation of insulin receptor-beta (Tyr(1,131)/Tyr(1,146)) and protein kinase B (Ser473). Gene expression data suggest that the gluconeogenic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, were upregulated. Thus, adipose overexpression of Dgat1 gene in FVB mice leads to diet-inducible insulin resistance, which is secondary to redistribution of fat from adipose tissue to the liver in the absence of obesity.",

        "Abstract": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective lipid-altering drugs for the treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design trial to determine the effects of simvastatin, 80 mg/day, on plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels and on the metabolism of apolipoprotein B (apoB) in VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and LDL and of triglycerides (TGs) in VLDL. Simvastatin therapy decreased TG, cholesterol, and apoB significantly in VLDL, IDL, and LDL. These effects were associated with reduced production of LDL-apoB, mainly as a result of reduced secretion of apoB-lipoproteins directly into the LDL density range. Statin therapy also reduced hepatic production of VLDL-TG. There were no effects of simvastatin on the fractional catabolic rates of VLDL-apoB or -TG or LDL-apoB. The basis for decreased VLDL-TG secretion during simvastatin treatment is not clear, but recent studies suggest that statins may activate peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). Activation of PPARalpha could lead to increased hepatic oxidation of fatty acids and less synthesis of TG for VLDL assembly.",

        "Abstract": "This randomized, controlled trial of cholesterol lowering by an oat bran cereal containing beta glucan vs a corn cereal without soluble fiber in Hispanic Americans was conducted for 11 weeks. One-hundred fifty-two men and women, ages 30 to 70 years, with baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels between 120 and 190 mg/dL and triglycerides <400 mg/dL were included. After eating a National Cholesterol Education Program Step 1 diet for 5 weeks, subjects were randomly assigned to the corn or the oat cereal for the next 6 weeks. The daily dose of beta glucan was 3 g. Consumption of oat cereal was associated with a reduction in plasma levels of both total cholesterol (-10.9+/-21.6 mg/dL; -4.5%) and LDL-C (-9.4+/-20.3 mg/dL; -5.3%). Consumption of corn cereal did not affect either total cholesterol (+1.2+/-18.3 mg/dL; 1.1%) or LDL-C (+1.2+/-17.5 mg/dL; 2.2%). Differences between the effects of the two cereals on total cholesterol and LDL-C were significant, P =.0003 and P =.0007, respectively.",

        "Title": "Regulation of plasma triglycerides in insulin resistance and diabetes.",
        "Abstract": "Increased plasma levels of triglycerides (TG) in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) are not only common characteristics of the dyslipidemia associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but are the central pathophysiologic feature of the abnormal lipid profile. Overproduction of VLDL leads to increased plasma levels of TG which, via an exchange process mediated by cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), results in low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I, and the generation of small, dense, cholesterol ester depleted low density lipoproteins (LDL). Increased assembly and secretion of VLDL by the liver results from the complex, post-transcriptional regulation of apolipoprotein B (apoB) metabolism in the liver. In the presence of low levels of hepatic TG and cholesterol, much of the constitutively synthesized apoB is degraded by both proteasomal and non-proteasomal pathways. When excess TG, and to a lesser extent, cholesterol, are present, and in the presence of active microsomal triglycerides transfer protein, apoB is targeted for secretion. The major sources of TG in the liver: uptake of fatty acids (FA) released by lipolysis of adipose tissue TG, uptake of TGFA in VLDL and chylomicrons remnants, and hepatic de novo lipogenesis (the synthesis of FA from glucose) are all abnormally increased in insulin resistance. Treatment of the dyslipidemia in insulin resistant individuals and patients with T2DM has been successful in reducing cardiovascular disease; LDL cholesterol, TG, and HDL cholesterol are all appropriate targets for therapy when diet, exercise, and weight loss do not achieve goals.",

        "Abstract": "For many years adipose tissue was viewed as the site where excess energy was stored, in the form of triglycerides (TGs), and where that energy, when needed elsewhere in the body, was released in the form of fatty acids (FAs). Recently, it has become clear that when the regulation of the storage and release of energy by adipose tissue is impaired, plasma FA levels become elevated and excessive metabolism of FA, including storage of TGs, occurs in nonadipose tissues. Most recently, work by several laboratories has made it clear that in addition to FA, adipose tissue communicates with the rest of the body by synthesizing and releasing a host of secreted molecules, collectively designated as adipokines. Several recent reviews have described how these molecules, along with FA, significantly effect total body glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Relatively little attention has been paid to the effects of adipokines on lipid metabolism. In this review, we will describe, in detail, the effects of molecules secreted by adipose tissue, including FA, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and apolipoproteins, on lipid homeostasis in several nonadipose tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreatic beta cells.",

        "Abstract": "Elevated plasma levels of VLDL triglycerides (TGs) are characteristic of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and are associated with increased production rates (PRs) of VLDL TGs and apoB. Lipoprotein lipase-mediated (LPL-mediated) lipolysis of VLDL TGs may also be reduced in T2DM if the level of LPL is decreased and/or the level of plasma apoC-III, an inhibitor of LPL-mediated lipolysis, is increased. We studied the effects of pioglitazone (Pio), a PPARgamma agonist that improves insulin sensitivity, on lipoprotein metabolism in patients with T2DM. Pio treatment reduced TG levels by increasing the fractional clearance rate (FCR) of VLDL TGs from the circulation, without changing direct removal of VLDL particles. This indicated increased lipolysis of VLDL TGs during Pio treatment, a mechanism supported by our finding of increased plasma LPL mass and decreased levels of plasma apoC-III. Lower apoC-III levels were due to reduced apoC-III PRs. We saw no effects of Pio on the PR of either VLDL TG or VLDL apoB. Thus, Pio, a PPARgamma agonist, reduced VLDL TG levels by increasing LPL mass and inhibiting apoC-III PR. These 2 changes were associated with an increased FCR of VLDL TGs, almost certainly due to increased LPL-mediated lipolysis.",

        "Abstract": "The relative importance of each core lipid in the assembly and secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) has been of interest over the past decade. The isolation of genes encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferases (ACAT1 and ACAT2) provided the opportunity to investigate the effects of isolated increases in triglycerides (TG) or cholesteryl esters (CE) on apolipoprotein B (apoB) lipoprotein biogenesis. Overexpression of human DGAT1 in rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells resulted in increased synthesis, cellular accumulation, and secretion of TG. These effects were associated with decreased intracellular degradation and increased secretion of newly synthesized apoB as VLDL. Similarly, overexpression of human ACAT1 or ACAT2 in McA-RH7777 cells resulted in increased synthesis, cellular accumulation, and secretion of CE. This led to decreased intracellular degradation and increased secretion of VLDL apoB. Overexpression of ACAT2 had a significantly greater impact upon assembly and secretion of VLDL from liver cells than did overexpression of ACAT1. The addition of oleic acid (OA) to media resulted in a further increase in VLDL secretion from cells expressing DGAT1, ACAT1, or ACAT2. VLDL secreted from DGAT1-expressing cells incubated in OA had a higher TG:CE ratio than VLDL secreted from ACAT1- and ACAT2-expressing cells treated with OA. These studies indicate that increasing DGAT1, ACAT1, or ACAT2 expression in McA-RH7777 cells stimulates the assembly and secretion of VLDL from liver cells and that the core composition of the secreted VLDL reflects the enzymatic activity that is elevated.",

        "Abstract": "Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT, EC2.3.1.20), a key enzyme in triglyceride (TG) biosynthesis, not only participates in lipid metabolism but also influences metabolic pathways of other fuel molecules. Changes in the expression and/or activity levels of DGAT may lead to changes in systemic insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis. The synthetic role of DGAT in adipose tissue, the liver, and the intestine, sites where endogenous levels of DGAT activity and TG synthesis are high, is relatively clear. Less clear is whether DGAT plays a mediating or preventive role in the development of ectopic lipotoxicity in tissues such as muscle and the pancreas, when their supply of free fatty acids (FFAs) exceeds their needs. Future studies with tissue-specific overexpression and/or knockout in these animal models would be expected to shed additional light on these issues.",

        "Abstract": "How omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) lower plasma lipid levels is incompletely understood. We previously showed that marine omega-3 PUFAs (docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] and eicosapentaenoic acid) stimulate a novel pathway, post-ER presecretory proteolysis (PERPP), that degrades apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100), thereby reducing lipoprotein secretion from liver cells. To identify signals stimulating PERPP, we examined known actions of omega-3 PUFA. In rat hepatoma or primary rodent hepatocytes incubated with omega-3 PUFA, cotreatment with the iron chelator desferrioxamine, an inhibitor of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, or vitamin E, a lipid antioxidant, suppressed increases in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARSs; a measure of lipid peroxidation products) and restored ApoB100 recovery and VLDL secretion. Moreover, omega-6 and nonmarine omega-3 PUFA, also prone to peroxidation, increased ApoB100 degradation via intracellular induction of TBARSs. Even without added fatty acids, degradation of ApoB100 in primary hepatocytes was blocked by desferrioxamine or antioxidant cotreatment. To extend these results in vivo, mice were infused with DHA, which increased hepatic TBARSs and reduced VLDL-ApoB100 secretion. These results establish a novel link between lipid peroxidation and oxidant stress with ApoB100 degradation via PERPP, and may be relevant to the hypolipidemic actions of dietary PUFAs, the basal regulation of ApoB100 secretion, and hyperlipidemias arising from ApoB100 overproduction.",

        "Title": "Regulation of hepatic apolipoprotein B-lipoprotein assembly and secretion by the availability of fatty acids. I. Differential response to the delivery of fatty acids via albumin or remnant-like emulsion particles.",
        "Abstract": "The in vivo effects of increased delivery of fatty acids (FA) to the liver are poorly defined. Therefore, we compared the effects of infusing either 6 mM oleic acid (OA) bound to albumin, 0.5-20% Intralipid, or saline for 3 or 6 h into male C57BL/6J mice. Infusions were followed by studies of triglyceride (TG) and apoB secretion. Although plasma FA levels increased similarly after either 20% Intralipid or 6 mM OA, TG secretion increased only after infusion of 4-20% Intralipid; TG secretion was unchanged by 6 mM OA. By contrast, 6-h infusions of either 6 mM OA or 4-20% Intralipid increased apoB secretion. 6 mM OA and 20% Intralipid each increased secretion of apoB from primary hepatocytes ex vivo. Importantly, 0.5-2% Intralipid, which delivered more FA to the liver than 6 mM OA, did not stimulate apoB secretion. Hepatic apoB mRNA levels were unaffected by either 6 mM OA or 20% Intralipid, but microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mRNA was significantly lower after 6-h infusions with 6 mM OA versus either saline or 20% Intralipid. Lower microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mRNA levels were associated with reduced hepatic TG mass after 6-h infusions of 6 mM OA. We conclude that 1) increased FA delivery to the liver in vivo increases secretion of apoB-lipoproteins via post-transcriptional mechanisms, 2) OA-induced apoB-lipoprotein secretion occurred at least in part via mechanisms other than by providing substrate for TG synthesis, and 3) the route of delivery of FA is important for its effects on apoB secretion.",

        "Abstract": "The site where bulk lipid is added to apoB100 low density lipoproteins (LDL)/high density lipoproteins (HDL) particles to form triglyceride-enriched very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) has not been identified definitively. We employed several strategies to address this question. First, McA RH7777 cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased for 1 h (Chase I) to allow study of newly synthesized apoB100 LDL/HDL remaining in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). After Chase I, cells were incubated for another hour (C2) with/without brefeldin A (BFA) and nocodazole (Noc) (to block ER to Golgi trafficking) and with/without oleic acid (OA). OA treatment alone during C2 increased VLDL secretion. This was prevented by the addition of BFA/Noc in C2. When C2 media were replaced by control media for another 1-h chase (C3), VLDL formed during OA treatment in C2 were secreted into C3 medium. Thus, OA-induced conversion of apoB100 LDL/HDL to VLDL during C2 occurred in the ER. Next, newly synthesized apoB100 lipoproteins were trapped in the Golgi by treatment with Noc and monensin during Chase I (C1), and C2 was carried out in the presence of BFA/Noc with/without OA and without monensin. Under these conditions, OA treatment during C2 did not stimulate VLDL secretion. The same pulse/chase protocols were followed by iodixanol subcellular fractionation, extraction of lipoproteins from ER and Golgi, and sucrose gradient separation of extracted lipoproteins. Cells treated with BFA/Noc and OA in C2 had VLDL in the ER. In the absence of OA, only LDL/HDL were present in the ER. The density of Golgi lipoproteins in these cells was not affected by OA. Similar results were obtained when ER were immuno-isolated with anti-calnexin antibodies. In conclusion, apoB100 bulk lipidation, resulting in conversion of LDL/HDL to VLDL, can occur in the ER, but not in the Golgi, in McA RH7777 cells.",

Ovariectomized apoB/BATless mice were more obese and more insulin-resistant than sham ovariectomized apoB/BATless mice. Estrogen replacement by subcutaneous pellet reversed the obesity, lowered plasma insulin levels, and normalized both glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity associated with ovariectomy. The apoB/BATless mouse should be a good model to delineate the molecular mechanisms whereby estrogen protects against insulin resistance.",

        "Abstract": "The metabolic syndrome, or insulin resistance syndrome, is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and related mortality and has an estimated age-adjusted US prevalence of 23.7%. Dyslipidemia in the syndrome is characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles in the context of normal/slightly elevated LDL cholesterol. Outcomes in treatment studies in or including diabetic patients suggest that a variety of therapies may be of benefit in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with the metabolic syndrome, including physiologic therapies and pharmacologic treatments, such as aspirin, antihypertensive therapy, anti-ischemic therapy, and lipid-modifying therapies. The recently updated National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines identify the metabolic syndrome as a secondary target of lipid-lowering therapy after LDL cholesterol reduction and recommend use of weight reduction and increased physical activity to address underlying risk factors as well as therapies to address specific lipid and nonlipid risk factors.",

        "Abstract": "Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB) is a large (520-kDa) complex secretory protein; its secretion is regulated posttranscriptionally by several degradation pathways. The best described of these degradative processes is co-translational ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of nascent apoB, involving the 70- and 90-kDa heat shock proteins and the multiple components of the proteasomal pathway. Ubiquitinylation involves several proteins, including ligases called E3s, that coordinate the covalent binding of ubiquitin to target proteins. The recent discovery that tumor autocrine motility factor receptor, also known as gp78, is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated E3, raised the possibility that this E3 might be involved in the ER-associated degradation of nascent apoB. In a series of experiments in HepG2 cells, we demonstrated that overexpression of gp78 was sufficient for increased ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of apoB, with reduced secretion of apoB-lipoproteins. This action of gp78 was specific: overexpression of the protein did not affect secretion of either albumin or apolipoprotein AI. Furthermore, overexpression of a cytosolic E3, Itch, had no effect on apoB secretion. Finally, using an in vitro translation system, we demonstrated that gp78 led to increased ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of apoB48. Together, these results indicate that an ER-associated protein, gp78, is a bona fide E3 ligase in the apoB ER-associated degradation pathway.",

        "Title": "The metabolic syndrome: targeting dyslipidaemia to reduce coronary risk.",
        "Abstract": "The metabolic syndrome is a complex constellation of disorders, each one a significant risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The increasing prevalence of this condition is a major concern for healthcare providers both in Europe and North America. The concern surrounding the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is reflected in the recently published National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Although complex in nature, the individual components of the metabolic syndrome appear to be linked by the presence of insulin resistance. Concurrently treating the underlying insulin resistance along with the complex array of other disorders should form the core of any management strategy. Treatment of atherogenic dyslipidaemia should be a major aim, since it is associated with a significant risk of CVD. While lifestyle modifications form the cornerstone of any dyslipidaemia management strategy, many patients require the addition of lipid-modifying drugs. Several agents are available for the treatment of lipid abnormalities, including fibrates, bile acid sequestrants, niacin and hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). Of these, statins should be used as the first treatment option in the majority of patients because they are efficacious for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are effective across the lipid profile and are well tolerated in the majority of cases. Furthermore, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends statins as first-line pharmacological treatment of dyslipidaemia in patients with diabetes mellitus. This review discusses the diagnosis and management of the metabolic syndrome and examines the potential of future treatment options.",

        "Title": "Posttranscriptional control of the expression and function of diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 in mouse adipocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 (DGAT1) catalyzes the final step of triglyceride synthesis in mammalian cells. Data obtained from DGAT1-knockout mice have indicated that this enzyme plays an important role in energy homeostasis. We investigated the regulation of the expression and function of DGAT1 in mouse 3T3-L1 cell as a model for mammalian adipocytes. We demonstrated that the DGAT1 protein level increased by approximately 90-fold following differentiation of 3T3-L1 into mature adipocytes, a change that was accompanied by approximately 7-fold increase in DGAT1 mRNA. On the other hand, forced overexpression of DGAT1 mRNA by >20-fold via a recombinant adenovirus only resulted in approximately 2-fold increase in DGAT1 protein in mature adipocytes and little increase in preadipocytes. These results indicated that gene expression of DGAT1 in adipocytes is subjected to rigorous posttranscriptional regulation, which is modulated significantly by the differentiation status of 3T3-L1 cells. Protein stability is not a significant factor in the control of DGAT1 expression. The steady-state levels of DGAT1 were unaffected by blockage of proteolytic pathways by ALLN. However, translational control was suggested by sequence analysis of the 5'-untranslated region of human DGAT1 (hDGAT1) mRNA. We found that the level of DGAT1 activity was predominantly a function of the steady-state level of DGAT1 protein. No significant functional changes were observed when the conserved tyrosine phosphorylation site in hDGAT1 was mutated by a single base pair substitution. Despite only a approximately 2-fold increase in DGAT1 protein caused by recombinant viral transduction, a proportionate increase in cellular triglyceride synthesis resulted without affecting the triglyceride lipolysis rate, leading to >2-fold increase in intracellular triglyceride accumulation. No change in adipocyte morphology or in the expression levels of lipoprotein lipase, proxisomal proliferation-activating receptor-gamma, and aP2 was evident secondary to DGAT1 overexpression at different stages in 3T3-L1 differentiation. These data suggest that dysregulation of DGAT1 may play a role in the development of obesity, and manipulation of the steady-state level of DGAT1 protein may offer a potential means to treat or prevent obesity.",

        "Abstract": "Although microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and newly synthesized triglyceride (TG) are critical for co-translational targeting of apolipoprotein B (apoB100) to lipoprotein assembly in hepatoma cell lines, their roles in the later stages of lipoprotein assembly remain unclear. Using N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal to prevent proteasomal degradation, HepG2 cells were radiolabeled and chased for 0-90 min (chase I). The medium was changed and cells chased for another 150 min (chase II) in the absence (control) or presence of Pfizer MTP inhibitor CP-10447 (CP). As chase I was extended, inhibition of apoB100 secretion by CP during chase II decreased from 75.9% to only 15% of control (no CP during chase II). Additional studies were conducted in which chase I was either 0 or 90 min, and chase II was in the presence of [(3)H]glycerol and either BSA (control), CP (inhibits both MTP activity and TG synthesis),BMS-1976360-1) (BMS) (inhibits only MTP activity), or triacsin C (TC) (inhibits only TG synthesis). When chase I was 0 min, CP, BMS, and TC reduced apoB100 secretion during chase II by 75.3, 73.9, and 53.9%. However, when chase I was 90 min, those agents reduced apoB100 secretion during chase II by only 16.0, 19.2, and 13.9%. Of note, all three inhibited secretion of newly synthesized TG during chase II by 80, 80, and 40%, whether chase I was 0 or 90 min. In both HepG2 cells and McA-RH7777 cells, if chase I was at least 60 min, inhibition of TG synthesis and/or MTP activity did not affect the density of secreted apoB100-lipoproteins under basal conditions. Oleic acid increased secretion of TG-enriched apoB100-lipoproteins similarly in the absence or presence of either of CP, BMS, or TC. We conclude that neither MTP nor newly synthesized TG is necessary for the later stages of apoB100-lipoprotein assembly and secretion in either HepG2 or McA-RH7777 cells.",

        "Title": "Effect of Pravastatin in the Treatment of Patients with Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia.",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of pravastatin in the treatment of subjects with Type III hyperlipoproteinemia. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. SETTING: Four lipid research clinics in the United States. PATIENTS: Twenty subjects between 18 and 70 years old with three diagnostic features of Type III hyperlipoproteinemia: very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C)/total plasma triglyceride ratio in excess of 0.30; beta-migrating VLDL pattern on agarose-gel electrophoresis; and the homozygous apolipoprotein E phenotype E(2)/E(2). After 4 weeks of dietary control, the subjects were eligible if their mean plasma total cholesterol level was at least 250 mg/dl and mean plasma trigylceraide level was at least 220 mg/dL. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomly assigned to pravastatin 40 mg hs or placebo hs at the start of the first 6-week double-blind treatment period. After completing this phase, subjects entered a 4-week placebo/drug washout phase before crossing over to the opposite treatment for the second 6-week double-blind treatment period. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma VLDL-C and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after ultracentrifugation and total triglyceride, cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) after 6 weeks of treatment; adverse clinical events and abnormal laboratory results. RESULTS: After 6 weeks of pravastatin theraphy, plasma levels of VLDL-C and LDL-C decreased 49% and 39%, respectively (p less-than-or-equal 0.01 vs. placebo). Total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations decreased 36% and 22%, respectively (p less-than-or-equal 0.001 vs. placebo). Levels of HDL-C increased 8% (p less-than-or-equal 0.01 vs. placebo). Pravastatin was tolerated well. One marked laboratory abnormality, an asymptomatic elevation of creatine phosphokinase, resolved upon completing pravastatin treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Pravastatin lowers plasma VLDL-C, LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglyceride and raises HDL-C in subjects with Type III hyperlipoproteinemia. The safety profile is excellent. Pravastatin reductase inhibitor therapy affords a useful approach to the management of Type III or remnant removal disease.",
