        "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for biomarkers important for clinical phenotypes can lead to clinically relevant discoveries. Conventional GWAS for quantitative traits are based on simplified regression models modeling the conditional mean of a phenotype as a linear function of genotype. We draw attention here to an alternative, lesser known approach, namely quantile regression that naturally extends linear regression to the analysis of the entire conditional distribution of a phenotype of interest. Quantile regression can be applied efficiently at biobank scale, while having some unique advantages such as (1) identifying variants with heterogeneous effects across quantiles of the phenotype distribution; (2) accommodating a wide range of phenotype distributions including non-normal distributions, with invariance of results to trait transformations; and (3) providing more detailed information about genotype-phenotype associations even for those associations identified by conventional GWAS. We show in simulations that quantile regression is powerful across both homogeneous and various heterogeneous models. Applications to 39 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank demonstrate that quantile regression can be a helpful complement to linear regression in GWAS and can identify variants with larger effects on high-risk subgroups of individuals but with lower or no contribution overall.",

        "Abstract": "About 37 million people in the United States have chronic kidney disease, a disease that encompasses diseases of multiple causes. About 10% or more of kidney diseases in adults and about 70% of selected chronic kidney diseases in children are expected to be explained by genetic causes. Despite the advances in genetic testing and an increasing understanding of the genetic bases of certain kidney diseases, genetic testing in nephrology lags behind other medical fields. More understanding of the benefits and logistics of genetic testing is needed to advance the implementation of genetic testing in chronic kidney diseases. Accordingly, the National Kidney Foundation convened a Working Group of experts with diverse expertise in genetics, nephrology, and allied fields to develop recommendations for genetic testing for monogenic disorders and to identify genetic risk factors for oligogenic and polygenic causes of kidney diseases. Algorithms for clinical decision making on genetic testing and a road map for advancing genetic testing in kidney diseases were generated. An important aspect of this initiative was the use of a modified Delphi process to reach group consensus on the recommendations. The recommendations and resources described herein provide support to nephrologists and allied health professionals to advance the use of genetic testing for diagnosis and screening of kidney diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate estimation of population allele frequency (AF) is crucial for gene discovery and genetic diagnostics. However, determining AF for frameshift-inducing small insertions and deletions (indels) faces challenges due to discrepancies in mapping and variant calling methods. Here, we propose an innovative approach to assess indel AF. We developed CRAFTS-indels (Calculating Regional Allele Frequency Targeting Small indels), an algorithm that combines AF of distinct indels within a given region and provides \"regional AF\" (rAF). We tested and validated CRAFTS-indels using three independent datasets: gnomAD v2 (n=125,748 samples), an internal dataset (IGM; n=39,367), and the UK BioBank (UKBB; n=469,835). By comparing rAF against standard AF, we identified rare indels with rAF exceeding standard AF (sAF\u226410",

        "Abstract": "Cardiovascular disease, infection, malignancy, and thromboembolism are major causes of morbidity and mortality in kidney transplant recipients (KTR). Prospectively identifying monogenic conditions associated with post-transplant complications may enable personalized management. Therefore, we developed a transplant morbidity panel (355 genes) associated with major post-transplant complications including cardiometabolic disorders, immunodeficiency, malignancy, and thrombophilia. This gene panel was then evaluated using exome sequencing data from 1590 KTR. Additionally, genes associated with monogenic kidney and genitourinary disorders along with American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) secondary findings v3.2 were annotated. Altogether, diagnostic variants in 37 genes associated with Mendelian kidney and genitourinary disorders were detected in 9.9% (158/1590) of KTR; 25.9% (41/158) had not been clinically diagnosed. Moreover, the transplant morbidity gene panel detected diagnostic variants for 56 monogenic disorders in 9.1% KTRs (144/1590). Cardiovascular disease, malignancy, immunodeficiency, and thrombophilia variants were detected in 5.1% (81), 2.1% (34), 1.8% (29) and 0.2% (3) among 1590 KTRs, respectively. Concordant phenotypes were present in half of these cases. Reviewing implications for transplant care, these genetic findings would have allowed physicians to set specific risk factor targets in 6.3% (9/144), arrange intensive surveillance in 97.2% (140/144), utilize preventive measures in 13.2% (19/144), guide disease-specific therapy in 63.9% (92/144), initiate specialty referral in 90.3% (130/144) and alter immunosuppression in 56.9% (82/144). Thus, beyond diagnostic testing for kidney disorders, sequence annotation identified monogenic disorders associated with common post-transplant complications in 9.1% of KTR, with important clinical implications. Incorporating genetic diagnostics for transplant morbidities would enable personalized management in pre- and post-transplant care.",

        "Abstract": "The relationship between genetic variation and gene expression in brain cell types and subtypes remains understudied. Here, we generated single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from the neocortex of 424 individuals of advanced age; we assessed the effect of genetic variants on RNA expression in cis (cis-expression quantitative trait loci) for seven cell types and 64 cell subtypes using 1.5 million transcriptomes. This effort identified 10,004 eGenes at the cell type level and 8,099 eGenes at the cell subtype level. Many eGenes are only detected within cell subtypes. A new variant influences APOE expression only in microglia and is associated with greater cerebral amyloid angiopathy but not Alzheimer's disease pathology, after adjusting for APOE\u03b54, providing mechanistic insights into both pathologies. Furthermore, only a TMEM106B variant affects the proportion of cell subtypes. Integration of these results with genome-wide association studies highlighted the targeted cell type and probable causal gene within Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, educational attainment and Parkinson's disease loci.",

        "Abstract": "Research on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for common, genetically complex chronic diseases aims to improve health-related predictions, tailor risk-reducing interventions, and improve health outcomes. Yet, the study and use of PRSs in clinical settings raise equity, clinical, and regulatory challenges that can be greater for individuals from historically marginalized racial, ethnic, and other minoritized communities. As part of the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics IV Network, we conducted online focus groups with patients/community members, clinicians, and members of institutional review boards to explore their views on key issues, including PRS research, return of PRS results, clinical translation, and barriers and facilitators to health behavioral changes in response to PRS results. Across stakeholder groups, our findings indicate support for PRS development and a strong interest in having PRS results returned to research participants. However, we also found multi-level barriers and significant differences in stakeholders' views about what is needed and possible for successful implementation. These include researcher-participant interaction formats, health and genomic literacy, and a range of structural barriers, such as financial instability, insurance coverage, and the absence of health-supporting infrastructure and affordable healthy food options in poorer neighborhoods. Our findings highlight the need to revisit and implement measures in PRS studies (e.g., incentives and resources for follow-up care), as well as system-level policies to promote equity in genomic research and health outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have improved in predictive performance, but several challenges remain to be addressed before PRSs can be implemented in the clinic, including reduced predictive performance of PRSs in diverse populations, and the interpretation and communication of genetic results to both providers and patients. To address these challenges, the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network has developed a framework and pipeline for return of a PRS-based genome-informed risk assessment to 25,000 diverse adults and children as part of a clinical study. From an initial list of 23 conditions, ten were selected for implementation based on PRS performance, medical actionability and potential clinical utility, including cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. Standardized metrics were considered in the selection process, with additional consideration given to strength of evidence in African and Hispanic populations. We then developed a pipeline for clinical PRS implementation (score transfer to a clinical laboratory, validation and verification of score performance), and used genetic ancestry to calibrate PRS mean and variance, utilizing genetically diverse data from 13,475 participants of the All of Us Research Program cohort to train and test model parameters. Finally, we created a framework for regulatory compliance and developed a PRS clinical report for return to providers and for inclusion in an additional genome-informed risk assessment. The initial experience from eMERGE can inform the approach needed to implement PRS-based testing in diverse clinical settings.",

        "Abstract": "African American (AA) kidney recipients have a higher risk of allograft rejection and failure compared to non-AAs, but to what extent these outcomes are due to genetic versus environmental effects is currently unknown. Herein, we tested the effects of recipient self-reported race versus genetic proportion of African ancestry (pAFR), and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) on kidney allograft outcomes in multiethnic kidney transplant recipients from Columbia University (N = 1083) and the University of Pennsylvania (N = 738). All participants were genotyped with SNP arrays to estimate genetic admixture proportions. US census tract variables were used to analyze the effect of neighborhood factors. In both cohorts, self-reported recipient AA race and pAFR were individually associated with increased risk of rejection and failure after adjustment for known clinical risk factors and neighborhood SES factors. Joint analysis confirmed that self-reported recipient AA race and pAFR were both associated with a higher risk of allograft rejection (AA: HR 1.61 (1.31-1.96), P = 4.05E-06; pAFR: HR 1.90 (1.46-2.48), P = 2.40E-06) and allograft failure (AA: HR 1.52 (1.18-1.97), P = .001; pAFR: HR 1.70 (1.22-2.35), P = .002). Further research is needed to disentangle the role of genetics versus environmental, social, and structural factors contributing to poor transplantation outcomes in kidney recipients of African ancestry.",

        "Abstract": "There is a need to define regions of gene activation or repression that control human kidney cells in states of health, injury, and repair to understand the molecular pathogenesis of kidney disease and design therapeutic strategies. Comprehensive integration of gene expression with epigenetic features that define regulatory elements remains a significant challenge. We measure dual single nucleus RNA expression and chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 histone modifications to decipher the chromatin landscape and gene regulation of the kidney in reference and adaptive injury states. We establish a spatially-anchored epigenomic atlas to define the kidney's active, silent, and regulatory accessible chromatin regions across the genome. Using this atlas, we note distinct control of adaptive injury in different epithelial cell types. A proximal tubule cell transcription factor network of ELF3, KLF6, and KLF10 regulates the transition between health and injury, while in thick ascending limb cells this transition is regulated by NR2F1. Further, combined perturbation of ELF3, KLF6, and KLF10 distinguishes two adaptive proximal tubular cell subtypes, one of which manifested a repair trajectory after knockout. This atlas will serve as a foundation to facilitate targeted cell-specific therapeutics by reprogramming gene regulatory networks.",

        "Abstract": "Some patients diagnosed with benign IgA nephropathy (IgAN) develop a progressive clinical course, not predictable by known clinical or histopathological parameters. To assess if gene expression can differentiate between progressors and non-progressors with assumed benign IgAN, we tested microdissected glomeruli from archival kidney biopsy sections from adult patients with stable clinical remission (21 non-progressors) or from 15 patients that had undergone clinical progression within a 25-year time frame. Based on 1 240 differentially expressed genes from patients with suitable sequencing results, we identified eight IgAN progressor and nine non-progressor genes using a two-component classifier. These genes, including APOL5 and ZXDC, predicted disease progression with 88% accuracy, 75% sensitivity and 100% specificity on average 21.6 years before progressive disease was clinically documented. APOL lipoproteins are associated with inflammation, autophagy and kidney disease while ZXDC is a zinc-finger transcription factor modulating adaptive immunity. Ten genes from our transcriptomics data overlapped with an external genome wide association study dataset, although the gene set enrichment test was not statistically significant. We also identified 45 drug targets in the DrugBank database, including angiotensinogen, a target of sparsentan (dual antagonist of the endothelin type A receptor and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor) currently investigated for IgAN treatment. Two validation cohorts were used for substantiating key results, one by immunohistochemistry and the other by nCounter technology. Thus, glomerular mRNA sequencing from diagnostic kidney biopsies from patients with assumed benign IgAN can differentiate between future progressors and non-progressors at the time of diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined by an interplay of monogenic, polygenic, and environmental risks. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and COL4A-associated nephropathy (COL4A-AN) represent the most common forms of monogenic kidney diseases. These disorders have incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, and we hypothesize that polygenic factors explain some of this variability. By combining SNP array, exome/genome sequence, and electronic health record data from the UK Biobank and All-of-Us cohorts, we demonstrate that the genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) significantly predicts CKD among ADPKD monogenic variant carriers. Compared to the middle tertile of the GPS for noncarriers, ADPKD variant carriers in the top tertile have a 54-fold increased risk of CKD, while ADPKD variant carriers in the bottom tertile have only a 3-fold increased risk of CKD. Similarly, the GPS significantly predicts CKD in COL4A-AN carriers. The carriers in the top tertile of the GPS have a 2.5-fold higher risk of CKD, while the risk for carriers in the bottom tertile is not different from the average population risk. These results suggest that accounting for polygenic risk improves risk stratification in monogenic kidney disease.",

        "Abstract": "African Americans have a significantly higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease, especially focal segmental glomerulosclerosis -, than European Americans. Two coding variants (G1 and G2) in the APOL1 gene play a major role in this disparity. While 13% of African Americans carry the high-risk recessive genotypes, only a fraction of these individuals develops FSGS or kidney failure, indicating the involvement of additional disease modifiers. Here, we show that the presence of the APOL1 p.N264K missense variant, when co-inherited with the G2 APOL1 risk allele, substantially reduces the penetrance of the G1G2 and G2G2 high-risk genotypes by rendering these genotypes low-risk. These results align with prior functional evidence showing that the p.N264K variant reduces the toxicity of the APOL1 high-risk alleles. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of APOL1-associated nephropathy, as well as for the clinical management of individuals with high-risk genotypes that include the G2 allele.",

        "Abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Critically ill COVID-19 patients are at twice the risk of in-hospital mortality compared to non-COVID AKI patients. We know little about the cell-specific mechanism in the kidney that contributes to worse clinical outcomes in these patients. New generation single cell technologies have the potential to provide insights into physiological states and molecular mechanisms in COVID-AKI. One of the key limitations is that these patients are severely ill posing significant risks in procuring additional biopsy tissue. We recently generated single nucleus RNA-sequencing data using COVID-AKI patient biopsy tissue as part of the human kidney atlas. Here we describe this approach in detail and report deeper comparative analysis of snRNAseq of 4 COVID-AKI, 4 reference, and 6 non-COVID-AKI biopsies. We also generated and analyzed urine transcriptomics data to find overlapping COVID-AKI-enriched genes and their corresponding cell types in the kidney from snRNA-seq data. We identified all major and minor cell types and states by using by using less than a few cubic millimeters of leftover tissue after pathological workup in our approach. Differential expression analysis of COVID-AKI biopsies showed pathways enriched in viral response, WNT signaling, kidney development, and cytokines in several nephron epithelial cells. COVID-AKI profiles showed a much higher proportion of altered TAL cells than non-COVID AKI and the reference samples. In addition to kidney injury and fibrosis markers indicating robust remodeling we found that, 17 genes overlap between urine cell COVID-AKI transcriptome and the snRNA-seq data from COVID-AKI biopsies. A key feature was that several of the distal nephron and collecting system cell types express these markers. Some of these markers have been previously observed in COVID-19 studies suggesting a common mechanism of injury and potentially the kidney as one of the sources of soluble factors with a potential role in disease progression.",

Spatially resolved transcriptomics captures cellular-level gene expression with corresponding spatial coordinates in two or three dimensions and can be used to infer SVGs effectively. However, current computational methods may not achieve reliable results and often cannot handle three-dimensional spatial transcriptomic data. Here we introduce BSP (big-small patch), a non-parametric model by comparing gene expression pattens at two spatial granularities to identify SVGs from two or three-dimensional spatial transcriptomics data in a fast and robust manner. This method has been extensively tested in simulations, demonstrating superior accuracy, robustness, and high efficiency. BSP is further validated by substantiated biological discoveries in cancer, neural science, rheumatoid arthritis, and kidney studies with various types of spatial transcriptomics technologies.",

        "Abstract": "As large-scale genomic screening becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding the influence of actionable results on healthcare utilization is key to estimating the potential long-term clinical impact. The eMERGE network sequenced individuals for actionable genes in multiple genetic conditions and returned results to individuals, providers, and the electronic health record. Differences in recommended health services (laboratory, imaging, and procedural testing) delivered within 12\u00a0months of return were compared among individuals with pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) findings to matched individuals with negative findings before and after return of results. Of 16,218 adults, 477 unselected individuals were found to have a monogenic risk for arrhythmia (n\u00a0= 95), breast cancer (n\u00a0= 96), cardiomyopathy (n\u00a0= 95), colorectal cancer (n\u00a0= 105), or familial hypercholesterolemia (n\u00a0= 86). Individuals with P/LP results more frequently received services after return (43.8%) compared to before return (25.6%) of results and compared to individuals with negative findings (24.9%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The annual cost of qualifying healthcare services increased from an average of $162 before return to $343 after return of results among the P/LP group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001); differences in the negative group were non-significant. The mean difference-in-differences was $149 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), which describes the increased cost within the P/LP group corrected for cost changes in the negative group. When stratified by individual conditions, significant cost differences were observed for arrhythmia, breast cancer, and cardiomyopathy. In conclusion, less than half of individuals received billed health services after monogenic return, which modestly increased healthcare costs for payors in the year following return.",

        "Abstract": "Fibronectin glomerulopathy is a rare inherited kidney disease, characterized by abnormal accumulation of fibronectin in the glomeruli. We report an exceptional case of recurrent fibronectin glomerulopathy first diagnosed in the kidney allograft. The presence of IgA staining in the native kidney biopsy and the reported family history of IgA nephropathy had led to initial pretransplant diagnosis of IgA nephropathy. At 4.5 years posttransplant, the patient presented with kidney insufficiency and minimal proteinuria. The allograft biopsy revealed glomerular deposits with very weak staining for immunoglobulins and vague filamentous material. Immunostaining for fibronectin was positive, and genetic studies showed a variant of unknown significance in the fibronectin 1 gene. Proteomic analyses of the glomeruli in the native kidney biopsy demonstrated large amount of fibronectin with abundant accumulation of the peptide synthesized by the detected variant. These findings established the diagnosis of recurrent fibronectin glomerulopathy secondary to a novel variant in the fibronectin 1 gene. This report sheds light on recurrent fibronectin glomerulopathy in the allograft, highlights the diagnostic pitfalls of the disease, and underscores the importance of pathologic-genomic correlation to establish the correct diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) are heterogeneous syndromes defined clinically by serial measures of kidney function. Each condition possesses strong histopathologic associations, including glomerular obsolescence or acute tubular necrosis, respectively. Despite such characterization, there remains wide variation in patient outcomes and treatment responses. Precision medicine efforts, as exemplified by the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP), have begun to establish evolving, spatially anchored, cellular and molecular atlases of the cell types, states, and niches of the kidney in health and disease. The KPMP atlas provides molecular context for CKD and AKI disease drivers and will help define subtypes of disease that are not readily apparent from canonical functional or histopathologic characterization but instead are appreciable through advanced clinical phenotyping, pathomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic, and metabolomic interrogation of kidney biopsy samples. This perspective outlines the structure of the KPMP, its approach to the integration of these diverse datasets, and its major outputs relevant to future patient care.",

        "Abstract": "Confounding is a major limitation of observational studies. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a powerful study design that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to enable examination of the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome in observational data. With the emergence of large-scale genome-wide association studies in nephrology over the past decade, MR has become a popular method to establish causal inferences. However, MR is a complex and challenging methodology that requires careful consideration to ensure robust results. This review article aims to summarize the basic concepts of MR, its application and relevance in nephrology, and the methodological challenges and limitations as well as discuss the current guidelines for design and reporting. With reference to a clinically relevant example of examining the causal relationship between the estimated glomerular filtration rate and cancer, this review outlines the key steps to conducting an MR study, including the key considerations and potential pitfalls at each step. These include defining the clinical question, selecting the data sources, identifying and refining appropriate genetic variants by considering linkage disequilibrium and associations with potential confounders, harmonization of variants across data sets, validation of the genetic instrument by assessing its strength, estimation of the causal effects, confirming the validity of the findings, and interpreting and reporting results.",

        "Abstract": "Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.",

        "Abstract": "The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) aims to create a kidney tissue atlas, define disease subgroups, and identify critical cells, pathways, and targets for novel therapies through molecular investigation of human kidney biopsies obtained from participants with AKI or CKD. We present the case of a 66-year-old woman with diabetic kidney disease who underwent a protocol KPMP kidney biopsy. Her clinical history included diabetes mellitus complicated by neuropathy and eye disease, increased insulin resistance, hypertension, albuminuria, and relatively preserved glomerular filtration rate (early CKD stage 3a). The patient's histopathology was consistent with diabetic nephropathy and arterial and arteriolar sclerosis. Three-dimensional, immunofluorescence imaging of the kidney biopsy specimen revealed extensive periglomerular neovascularization that was underestimated by standard histopathologic approaches. Spatial transcriptomics was performed to obtain gene expression signatures at discrete areas of the kidney biopsy. Gene expression in the areas of glomerular neovascularization revealed increased expression of genes involved in angiogenic signaling, proliferation, and survival of endothelial cells, as well as new vessel maturation and stability. This molecular correlation provides additional insights into the development of kidney disease in patients with diabetes and spotlights how novel molecular techniques used by the KPMP can supplement and enrich the histopathologic diagnosis obtained from a kidney biopsy.",

        "Abstract": "Arteriolar hyalinosis in kidneys is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease, the main cause of mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The underlying molecular mechanisms of protein accumulation in the subendothelial space are not well understood. Using single cell transcriptomic data and whole slide images from kidney biopsies of patients with CKD and acute kidney injury in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project, the molecular signals associated with arteriolar hyalinosis were evaluated. Co-expression network analysis of the endothelial genes yielded three gene set modules as significantly associated with arteriolar hyalinosis. Pathway analysis of these modules showed enrichment of transforming growth factor beta / bone morphogenetic protein (TGF\u03b2 / BMP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathways in the endothelial cell signatures. Ligand-receptor analysis identified multiple integrins and cell adhesion receptors as over-expressed in arteriolar hyalinosis, suggesting a potential role of integrin-mediated TGF\u03b2 signaling. Further analysis of arteriolar hyalinosis associated endothelial module genes identified focal segmental glomerular sclerosis as an enriched term. On validation in gene expression profiles from the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network cohort, one of the three modules was significantly associated with the composite endpoint (> 40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or kidney failure) independent of age, sex, race, and baseline eGFR, suggesting poor prognosis with elevated expression of genes in this module. Thus, integration of structural and single cell molecular features yielded biologically relevant gene sets, signaling pathways and ligand-receptor interactions, underlying arteriolar hyalinosis and putative targets for therapeutic intervention.",

Here we performed a genome-wide association study of 10,146 kidney-biopsy-diagnosed IgAN cases and 28,751 controls across 17 international cohorts. We defined 30 genome-wide significant risk loci explaining 11% of disease risk. A total of 16 loci were new, including TNFSF4/TNFSF18, REL, CD28, PF4V1, LY86, LYN, ANXA3, TNFSF8/TNFSF15, REEP3, ZMIZ1, OVOL1/RELA, ETS1, IGH, IRF8, TNFRSF13B and FCAR. The risk loci were enriched in gene orthologs causing abnormal IgA levels when genetically manipulated in mice. We also observed a positive genetic correlation between IgAN and serum IgA levels. High polygenic score for IgAN was associated with earlier onset of kidney failure. In a comprehensive functional annotation analysis of candidate causal genes, we observed convergence of biological candidates on a common set of inflammatory signaling pathways and cytokine ligand-receptor pairs, prioritizing potential new drug targets.",

        "Abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have improved in predictive performance supporting their use in clinical practice. Reduced predictive performance of PRS in diverse populations can exacerbate existing health disparities. The NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network is returning a PRS-based genome-informed risk assessment to 25,000 diverse adults and children. We assessed PRS performance, medical actionability, and potential clinical utility for 23 conditions. Standardized metrics were considered in the selection process with additional consideration given to strength of evidence in African and Hispanic populations. Ten conditions were selected with a range of high-risk thresholds: atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, prostate cancer, asthma, type 1 diabetes, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. We developed a pipeline for clinical PRS implementation, used genetic ancestry to calibrate PRS mean and variance, created a framework for regulatory compliance, and developed a PRS clinical report. eMERGE's experience informs the infrastructure needed to implement PRS-based implementation in diverse clinical settings.",

However, comprehensive integration of gene expression with epigenetic features that define regulatory elements remains a significant challenge. We measured dual single nucleus RNA expression and chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 histone modifications to decipher the chromatin landscape and gene regulation of the kidney in reference and adaptive injury states. We established a comprehensive and spatially-anchored epigenomic atlas to define the kidney's active, silent, and regulatory accessible chromatin regions across the genome. Using this atlas, we noted distinct control of adaptive injury in different epithelial cell types. A proximal tubule cell transcription factor network of ",

        "Abstract": "With the burgeoning development of computational phenotypes, it is increasingly difficult to identify the right phenotype for the right tasks. This study uses a mixed-methods approach to develop and evaluate a novel metadata framework for retrieval of and reusing computational phenotypes. Twenty active phenotyping researchers from 2 large research networks, Electronic Medical Records and Genomics and Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, were recruited to suggest metadata elements. Once consensus was reached on 39 metadata elements, 47 new researchers were surveyed to evaluate the utility of the metadata framework. The survey consisted of 5-Likert multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. Two more researchers were asked to use the metadata framework to annotate 8 type-2 diabetes mellitus phenotypes. More than 90% of the survey respondents rated metadata elements regarding phenotype definition and validation methods and metrics positively with a score of 4 or 5. Both researchers completed annotation of each phenotype within 60\u2009min. Our thematic analysis of the narrative feedback indicates that the metadata framework was effective in capturing rich and explicit descriptions and enabling the search for phenotypes, compliance with data standards, and comprehensive validation metrics. Current limitations were its complexity for data collection and the entailed human costs.",

        "Abstract": "Fine-mapping is commonly used to identify putative causal variants at genome-wide significant loci. Here we propose a Bayesian model for fine-mapping that has several advantages over existing methods, including flexible specification of the prior distribution of effect sizes, joint modeling of summary statistics and functional annotations and accounting for discrepancies between summary statistics and external linkage disequilibrium in meta-analyses. Using simulations, we compare performance with commonly used fine-mapping methods and show that the proposed model has higher power and lower false discovery rate (FDR) when including functional annotations, and higher power, lower FDR and higher coverage for credible sets in meta-analyses. We further illustrate our approach by applying it to a meta-analysis of Alzheimer's disease genome-wide association studies where we prioritize putatively causal variants and genes.",

        "Abstract": "Pediatric steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (pSSNS) is the most common childhood glomerular disease. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified a risk locus in the HLA Class II region and three additional independent risk loci. But the genetic architecture of pSSNS, and its genetically driven pathobiology, is largely unknown. Here, we conduct a multi-population GWAS meta-analysis in 38,463 participants (2440 cases). We then conduct conditional analyses and population specific GWAS. We discover twelve significant associations-eight from the multi-population meta-analysis (four novel), two from the multi-population conditional analysis (one novel), and two additional novel loci from the European meta-analysis. Fine-mapping implicates specific amino acid haplotypes in HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 driving the HLA Class II risk locus. Non-HLA loci colocalize with eQTLs of monocytes and numerous T-cell subsets in independent datasets. Colocalization with kidney eQTLs is lacking but overlap with kidney cell open chromatin suggests an uncharacterized disease mechanism in kidney cells. A polygenic risk score (PRS) associates with earlier disease onset. Altogether, these discoveries expand our knowledge of pSSNS genetic architecture across populations and provide cell-specific insights into its molecular drivers. Evaluating these associations in additional cohorts will refine our understanding of population specificity, heterogeneity, and clinical and molecular associations.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital obstructive uropathy (COU) is a prevalent human developmental defect with highly heterogeneous clinical presentations and outcomes. Genetics may refine diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, but the genomic architecture of COU is largely unknown. Comprehensive genomic screening study of 733 cases with three distinct COU subphenotypes revealed disease etiology in 10.0% of them. We detected no significant differences in the overall diagnostic yield among COU subphenotypes, with characteristic variable expressivity of several mutant genes. Our findings therefore may legitimize a genetic first diagnostic approach for COU, especially when burdening clinical and imaging characterization is not complete or available.",

        "Abstract": "We propose BIGKnock (BIobank-scale Gene-based association test via Knockoffs), a computationally efficient gene-based testing approach for biobank-scale data, that leverages long-range chromatin interaction data, and performs conditional genome-wide testing via knockoffs. BIGKnock can prioritize causal genes over proxy associations at a locus. We apply BIGKnock to the UK Biobank data with 405,296 participants for multiple binary and quantitative traits, and show that relative to conventional gene-based tests, BIGKnock produces smaller sets of significant genes that contain the causal gene(s) with high probability. We further illustrate its ability to pinpoint potential causal genes at [Formula: see text] of the associated loci.",

        "Abstract": "APOL1 high-risk genotypes confer a significant risk of kidney disease, but variability in patient outcomes suggests the presence of modifiers of the APOL1 effect. We show that a diverse population of CKD patients with high-risk APOL1 genotypes have an increased lifetime risk of kidney failure and higher eGFR decline rates, with a graded risk among specific high-risk genotypes. CKD patients with high-risk APOL1 genotypes have a lower diagnostic yield for monogenic kidney disease. Exome sequencing revealed enrichment of rare missense variants within the inflammasome pathway modifying the effect of APOL1 risk genotypes, which may explain some clinical heterogeneity.",

        "Abstract": "The electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network assessed the feasibility of deploying portable phenotype rule-based algorithms with natural language processing (NLP) components added to improve performance of existing algorithms using electronic health records (EHRs). Based on scientific merit and predicted difficulty, eMERGE selected six existing phenotypes to enhance with NLP. We assessed performance, portability, and ease of use. We summarized lessons learned by: (1) challenges; (2) best practices to address challenges based on existing evidence and/or eMERGE experience; and (3) opportunities for future research. Adding NLP resulted in improved, or the same, precision and/or recall for all but one algorithm. Portability, phenotyping workflow/process, and technology were major themes. With NLP, development and validation took longer. Besides portability of NLP technology and algorithm replicability, factors to ensure success include privacy protection, technical infrastructure setup, intellectual property agreement, and efficient communication. Workflow improvements can improve communication and reduce implementation time. NLP performance varied mainly due to clinical document heterogeneity; therefore, we suggest using semi-structured notes, comprehensive documentation, and customization options. NLP portability is possible with improved phenotype algorithm performance, but careful planning and architecture of the algorithms is essential to support local customizations.",

        "Abstract": "Immunoglobulin A (IgA) mediates mucosal responses to food antigens and the intestinal microbiome and is involved in susceptibility to mucosal pathogens, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and IgA nephropathy. We performed a genome-wide association study of serum IgA levels in 41,263 individuals of diverse ancestries and identified 20 genome-wide significant loci, including 9 known and 11 novel loci. Co-localization analyses with expression QTLs prioritized candidate genes for 14 of 20 significant loci. Most loci encoded genes that produced immune defects and IgA abnormalities when genetically manipulated in mice. We also observed positive genetic correlations of serum IgA levels with IgA nephropathy, type 2 diabetes, and body mass index, and negative correlations with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and several infections. Mendelian randomization supported elevated serum IgA as a causal factor in IgA nephropathy. African ancestry was consistently associated with higher serum IgA levels and greater frequency of IgA-increasing alleles compared to other ancestries. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of IgA levels and its potential role in human disease.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Prognostic biomarkers reflective of underlying molecular mechanisms are critically needed for effective management of DKD. A three-marker panel was derived from a proteomics analysis of plasma samples by an unbiased machine learning approach from participants (N = 58) in the Clinical Phenotyping and Resource Biobank study. In combination with standard clinical parameters, this panel improved prediction of the composite outcome of ESKD or a 40% decline in glomerular filtration rate. The panel was validated in an independent group (N = 68), who also had kidney transcriptomic profiles. One marker, plasma angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2), was significantly associated with outcomes in cohorts from the Cardiovascular Health Study (N = 3,183) and the Chinese Cohort Study of Chronic Kidney Disease (N = 210). Glomerular transcriptional angiopoietin/Tie (ANG-TIE) pathway scores, derived from the expression of 154 ANG-TIE signaling mediators, correlated positively with plasma ANGPT2 levels and kidney outcomes. Higher receptor expression in glomeruli and higher ANG-TIE pathway scores in endothelial cells corroborated potential functional effects in the kidney from elevated plasma ANGPT2 levels. Our work suggests that ANGPT2 is a promising prognostic endothelial biomarker with likely functional impact on glomerular pathogenesis in DKD.",

        "Abstract": "Host genetics is a key determinant of COVID-19 outcomes. Previously, the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative genome-wide association study used common variants to identify multiple loci associated with COVID-19 outcomes. However, variants with the largest impact on COVID-19 outcomes are expected to be rare in the population. Hence, studying rare variants may provide additional insights into disease susceptibility and pathogenesis, thereby informing therapeutics development. Here, we combined whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing from 21 cohorts across 12 countries and performed rare variant exome-wide burden analyses for COVID-19 outcomes. In an analysis of 5,085 severe disease cases and 571,737 controls, we observed that carrying a rare deleterious variant in the SARS-CoV-2 sensor toll-like receptor TLR7 (on chromosome X) was associated with a 5.3-fold increase in severe disease (95% CI: 2.75-10.05, p = 5.41x10-7). This association was consistent across sexes. These results further support TLR7 as a genetic determinant of severe disease and suggest that larger studies on rare variants influencing COVID-19 outcomes could provide additional insights.",

        "Abstract": "Pathogenic structural genetic variants, also known as genomic disorders, have been associated with pediatric CKD. This study extends those results across the lifespan, with genomic disorders enriched in both pediatric and adult patients compared with controls. In the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study, genomic disorders were also associated with lower serum Mg, lower educational performance, and a higher risk of death. A phenome-wide association study confirmed the link between kidney disease and genomic disorders in an unbiased way. Systematic detection of genomic disorders can provide a molecular diagnosis and refine prediction of risk and prognosis.",

        "Abstract": "Studies have shown that as many as 1 in 10 adults with chronic kidney disease has a monogenic form of disease. However, genetic services in adult nephrology are limited. An adult Kidney Genetics Clinic was established within the nephrology division at a large urban academic medical center to increase access to genetic services and testing in adults with kidney disease. Between June 2019 and December 2021, a total of 363 patients were referred to the adult Kidney Genetics Clinic. Of those who completed genetic testing, a positive diagnostic finding was identified in 27.1%, a candidate diagnostic finding was identified in 6.7% of patients, and a nondiagnostic positive finding was identified in an additional 8.6% of patients, resulting in an overall yield of 42.4% for clinically relevant genetic findings in tested patients. A genetic diagnosis had implications for medical management, family member testing, and eligibility for clinical trials. With the utilization of telemedicine, genetic services reached a diverse geographic and patient population. Genetic education efforts were integral to the clinic's success, as they increased visibility and helped providers identify appropriate referrals. Ongoing access to genomic services will remain a fundamental component of patient care in adults with kidney disease.",

        "Abstract": "COVID-19 has highly variable clinical courses. The search for prognostic host factors for COVID-19 outcome is a priority. We performed logistic regression for ICU admission against a polygenic score (PGS) for Cystatin C (CyC) production in patients with COVID-19. We analyzed the predictive value of longitudinal plasma CyC levels in an independent cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In four cohorts spanning European and African ancestry populations, we identified a significant association between CyC-production PGS and odds of critical illness (n cases=2,319), with the strongest association captured in the UKB cohort (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.58-2.87, p=7.12e-7). Plasma proteomics from an independent cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n cases = 131) demonstrated that CyC production was associated with COVID-specific mortality (p=0.0007). Our findings suggest that CyC may be useful for stratification of patients and it has functional role in the host response to COVID-19.",

        "Abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a worldwide scourge caused by both genetic and environmental risk factors that disproportionately afflicts communities of color. Leveraging existing large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), polygenic risk scores (PRS) have shown promise to complement established clinical risk factors and intervention paradigms, and improve early diagnosis and prevention of T2D. However, to date, T2D PRS have been most widely developed and validated in individuals of European descent. Comprehensive assessment of T2D PRS in non-European populations is critical for equitable deployment of PRS to clinical practice that benefits global populations.",

Polygenic prediction could enhance CKD screening and prevention; however, this approach has not been optimized for ancestrally diverse populations. By combining APOL1 risk genotypes with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of kidney function, we designed, optimized and validated a genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) for CKD. The new GPS was tested in 15 independent cohorts, including 3 cohorts of European ancestry (n\u2009=\u200997,050), 6 cohorts of African ancestry (n\u2009=\u200914,544), 4 cohorts of Asian ancestry (n\u2009=\u20098,625) and 2 admixed Latinx cohorts (n\u2009=\u20093,625). We demonstrated score transferability with reproducible performance across all tested cohorts. The top 2% of the GPS was associated with nearly threefold increased risk of CKD across ancestries. In African ancestry cohorts, the APOL1 risk genotype and polygenic component of the GPS had additive effects on the risk of CKD.",

        "Abstract": "The continual development of potent immunosuppressive regimens has led to a decreased incidence of acute rejection and improvement of short-term kidney allograft survival. In contrast to acute rejection, glomerular diseases of the kidney allograft are being encountered more frequently and are emerging as leading causes of late kidney allograft failure. Although data on the pathogeneses of glomerular diseases in the kidney allograft are sparse, cumulative evidence suggests that post-transplant glomerular diseases may be the result of inherited predispositions and immunologic triggers. Although studying immunologic signals and performing genome-wide association studies are ideal approaches to tackle glomerular diseases in the kidney allograft, such studies are challenging because of the lack of adequately powered cohorts. In this review, we focus on the most commonly encountered recurrent and de novo glomerular diseases in the kidney allograft. We address the important advances made in understanding the immunopathology and genetic susceptibility of glomerular diseases in the native kidney and how to benefit from such knowledge to further our knowledge of post-transplant glomerular diseases. Defining genomic and immune predictors for glomerular diseases in the kidney allograft would support novel donor-recipient matching strategies and development of targeted therapies to ultimately improve long-term kidney allograft survival.",

        "Abstract": "Numerous genes for monogenic kidney diseases with classical patterns of inheritance, as well as genes for complex kidney diseases that manifest in combination with environmental factors, have been discovered. Genetic findings are increasingly used to inform clinical management of nephropathies, and have led to improved diagnostics, disease surveillance, choice of therapy, and family counseling. All of these steps rely on accurate interpretation of genetic data, which can be outpaced by current rates of data collection. In March of 2021, Kidney Diseases: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a Controversies Conference on \"Genetics in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\" to review the current state of understanding of monogenic and complex (polygenic) kidney diseases, processes for applying genetic findings in clinical medicine, and use of genomics for defining and stratifying CKD. Given the important contribution of genetic variants to CKD, practitioners with CKD patients are advised to \"think genetic,\" which specifically involves obtaining a family history, collecting detailed information on age of CKD onset, performing clinical examination for extrarenal symptoms, and considering genetic testing. To improve the use of genetics in nephrology, meeting participants advised developing an advanced training or subspecialty track for nephrologists, crafting guidelines for testing and treatment, and educating patients, students, and practitioners. Key areas of future research, including clinical interpretation of genome variation, electronic phenotyping, global representation, kidney-specific molecular data, polygenic scores, translational epidemiology, and open data resources, were also identified.",

        "Abstract": "The current strategy to detect acute injury of kidney tubular cells relies on changes in serum levels of creatinine. Yet serum creatinine (sCr) is a marker of both functional and pathological processes and does not adequately assay tubular injury. In addition, sCr may require days to reach diagnostic thresholds, yet tubular cells respond with programs of damage and repair within minutes or hours. To detect acute responses to clinically relevant stimuli, we created mice expressing Rosa26-floxed-stop uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (Uprt) and inoculated 4-thiouracil (4-TU) to tag nascent RNA at selected time points. Cre-driven 4-TU-tagged RNA was isolated from intact kidneys and demonstrated that volume depletion and ischemia induced different genetic programs in collecting ducts and intercalated cells. Even lineage-related cell types expressed different genes in response to the 2 stressors. TU tagging also demonstrated the transient nature of the responses. Because we placed Uprt in the ubiquitously active Rosa26 locus, nascent RNAs from many cell types can be tagged in vivo and their roles interrogated under various conditions. In short, 4-TU labeling identifies stimulus-specific, cell-specific, and time-dependent acute responses that are otherwise difficult to detect with other technologies and are entirely obscured when sCr is the sole metric of kidney damage.",

        "Abstract": "The OAS1/2/3 cluster has been identified as a risk locus for severe COVID-19 among individuals of European ancestry, with a protective haplotype of approximately 75 kilobases (kb) derived from Neanderthals in the chromosomal region 12q24.13. This haplotype contains a splice variant of OAS1, which occurs in people of African ancestry independently of gene flow from Neanderthals. Using trans-ancestry fine-mapping approaches in 20,779 hospitalized cases, we demonstrate that this splice variant is likely to be the SNP responsible for the association at this locus, thus strongly implicating OAS1 as an effector gene influencing COVID-19 severity.",

        "Abstract": "An understanding of the ethical underpinnings of human subjects research that involves some risk to participants without anticipated direct clinical benefit-such as the kidney biopsy procedure as part of the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP)-requires a critical examination of the risks as well as the diverse set of countervailing potential benefits to participants. This kind of deliberation has been foundational to the development and conduct of the KPMP. Herein, we use illustrative features of this research paradigm to develop a more comprehensive conceptualization of the types of benefits that may be important to research participants, including respecting pluralistic values, supporting the opportunity to act altruistically, and enhancing benefits to a participant's community. This approach may serve as a model to help researchers, ethicists, and regulators to identify opportunities to better respect and support participants in future research that entails some risk to these participants as well as to improve the quality of research for people with kidney disease.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThere is considerable variability in COVID-19 outcomes among younger adults, and some of this variation may be due to genetic predisposition.MethodsWe combined individual level data from 13,888 COVID-19 patients (n = 7185 hospitalized) from 17 cohorts in 9 countries to assess the association of the major common COVID-19 genetic risk factor (chromosome 3 locus tagged by rs10490770) with mortality, COVID-19-related complications, and laboratory values. We next performed metaanalyses using FinnGen and the Columbia University COVID-19 Biobank.ResultsWe found that rs10490770 risk allele carriers experienced an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7). Risk allele carriers had increased odds of several COVID-19 complications: severe respiratory failure (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.6), venous thromboembolism (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4), and hepatic injury (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0). Risk allele carriers age 60 years and younger had higher odds of death or severe respiratory failure (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.8-3.9) compared with those of more than 60 years (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8; interaction, P = 0.038). Among individuals 60 years and younger who died or experienced severe respiratory failure, 32.3% were risk-variant carriers compared with 13.9% of those not experiencing these outcomes. This risk variant improved the prediction of death or severe respiratory failure similarly to, or better than, most established clinical risk factors.ConclusionsThe major common COVID-19 genetic risk factor is associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality, which are more pronounced among individuals 60 years or younger. The effect was similar in magnitude and more common than most established clinical risk factors, suggesting potential implications for future clinical risk management.",

        "Abstract": "Blocking the complement system as a therapeutic strategy has been proposed for numerous glomerular diseases but presents myriad questions and challenges, not the least of which is demonstrating efficacy and safety. In light of these potential issues and because there are an increasing number of anticomplement therapy trials either planned or under way, the National Kidney Foundation facilitated an all-virtual scientific workshop entitled \"Improving Clinical Trials for Anti-Complement Therapies in Complement-Mediated Glomerulopathies.\" Attended by patient representatives and experts in glomerular diseases, complement physiology, and clinical trial design, the aim of this workshop was to develop standards applicable for designing and conducting clinical trials for anticomplement therapies across a wide spectrum of complement-mediated glomerulopathies. Discussions focused on study design, participant risk assessment and mitigation, laboratory measurements and biomarkers to support these studies, and identification of optimal outcome measures to detect benefit, specifically for trials in complement-mediated diseases. This report summarizes the discussions from this workshop and outlines consensus recommendations.",

        "Abstract": "Labeling clinical data from electronic health records (EHR) in health systems requires extensive knowledge of human expert, and painstaking review by clinicians. Furthermore, existing phenotyping algorithms are not uniformly applied across large datasets and can suffer from inconsistencies in case definitions across different algorithms. We describe here quantitative disease risk scores based on almost unsupervised methods that require minimal input from clinicians, can be applied to large datasets, and alleviate some of the main weaknesses of existing phenotyping algorithms. We show applications to phenotypic data on approximately 100,000 individuals in eMERGE, and focus on several complex diseases, including Chronic Kidney Disease, Coronary Artery Disease, Type 2 Diabetes, Heart Failure, and a few others. We demonstrate that relative to existing approaches, the proposed methods have higher prediction accuracy, can better identify phenotypic features relevant to the disease under consideration, can perform better at clinical risk stratification, and can identify undiagnosed cases based on phenotypic features available in the EHR. Using genetic data from the eMERGE-seq panel that includes sequencing data for 109 genes on 21,363 individuals from multiple ethnicities, we also show how the new quantitative disease risk scores help improve the power of genetic association studies relative to the standard use of disease phenotypes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of quantitative disease risk scores derived from rich phenotypic EHR databases to provide a more meaningful characterization of clinical risk for diseases of interest beyond the prevalent binary (case-control) classification.",

        "Abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness that can result in hospitalization or death. We used exome sequence data to investigate associations between rare genetic variants and seven COVID-19 outcomes in 586,157 individuals, including 20,952 with COVID-19. After accounting for multiple testing, we did not identify any clear associations with rare variants either exome wide or when specifically focusing on (1) 13 interferon pathway genes in which rare deleterious variants have been reported in individuals with severe COVID-19, (2) 281 genes located in susceptibility loci identified by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, or (3) 32 additional genes of immunologic relevance and/or therapeutic potential. Our analyses indicate there are no significant associations with rare protein-coding variants with detectable effect sizes at our current sample sizes. Analyses will be updated as additional data become available, and results are publicly available through the Regeneron Genetics Center COVID-19 Results Browser.",

        "Abstract": "Age is the dominant risk factor for infectious diseases, but the mechanisms linking age to infectious disease risk are incompletely understood. Age-related mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) detected from genotyping of blood-derived DNA, are structural somatic variants indicative of clonal hematopoiesis, and are associated with aberrant leukocyte cell counts, hematological malignancy, and mortality. Here, we show that mCAs predispose to diverse types of infections. We analyzed mCAs from 768,762 individuals without hematological cancer at the time of DNA acquisition across five biobanks. Expanded autosomal mCAs were associated with diverse incident infections (hazard ratio (HR) 1.25; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20091.15-1.36; P\u2009=\u20091.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910",

        "Title": "Novel EDGE encoding method enhances ability to identify genetic interactions.",
        "Abstract": "Assumptions are made about the genetic model of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) when choosing a traditional genetic encoding: additive, dominant, and recessive. Furthermore, SNPs across the genome are unlikely to demonstrate identical genetic models. However, running SNP-SNP interaction analyses with every combination of encodings raises the multiple testing burden. Here, we present a novel and flexible encoding for genetic interactions, the elastic data-driven genetic encoding (EDGE), in which SNPs are assigned a heterozygous value based on the genetic model they demonstrate in a dataset prior to interaction testing. We assessed the power of EDGE to detect genetic interactions using 29 combinations of simulated genetic models and found it outperformed the traditional encoding methods across 10%, 30%, and 50% minor allele frequencies (MAFs). Further, EDGE maintained a low false-positive rate, while additive and dominant encodings demonstrated inflation. We evaluated EDGE and the traditional encodings with genetic data from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network for five phenotypes: age-related macular degeneration (AMD), age-related cataract, glaucoma, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and resistant hypertension. A multi-encoding genome-wide association study (GWAS) for each phenotype was performed using the traditional encodings, and the top results of the multi-encoding GWAS were considered for SNP-SNP interaction using the traditional encodings and EDGE. EDGE identified a novel SNP-SNP interaction for age-related cataract that no other method identified: rs7787286 (MAF: 0.041; intergenic region of chromosome 7)-rs4695885 (MAF: 0.34; intergenic region of chromosome 4) with a Bonferroni LRT p of 0.018. A SNP-SNP interaction was found in data from the UK Biobank within 25 kb of these SNPs using the recessive encoding: rs60374751 (MAF: 0.030) and rs6843594 (MAF: 0.34) (Bonferroni LRT p: 0.026). We recommend using EDGE to flexibly detect interactions between SNPs exhibiting diverse action.",

        "Abstract": "Kidney fibrosis constitutes the shared final pathway of nearly all chronic nephropathies, but biomarkers for the non-invasive assessment of kidney fibrosis are currently not available. To address this, we characterize five candidate biomarkers of kidney fibrosis: Cadherin-11 (CDH11), Sparc-related modular calcium binding protein-2 (SMOC2), Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), Matrix-Gla protein, and Thrombospondin-2. Gene expression profiles in single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq) datasets from rodent models of fibrosis and human chronic kidney disease (CKD) were explored, and Luminex-based assays for each biomarker were developed. Plasma and urine biomarker levels were measured using independent prospective cohorts of CKD: the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort, a cohort of individuals with biopsy-confirmed semiquantitative assessment of kidney fibrosis, and the Seattle Kidney Study, a cohort of patients with common forms of CKD. Ordinal logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to test associations of biomarkers with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and progression to end-stage kidney disease and death, respectively. Sc/snRNA-seq data confirmed cell-specific expression of biomarker genes in fibroblasts. After multivariable adjustment, higher levels of plasma CDH11, SMOC2, and PEDF and urinary CDH11 and PEDF were significantly associated with increasing severity of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort. In both cohorts, higher levels of plasma and urinary SMOC2 and urinary CDH11 were independently associated with progression to end-stage kidney disease. Higher levels of urinary PEDF associated with end-stage kidney disease in the Seattle Kidney Study, with a similar signal in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort, although the latter narrowly missed statistical significance. Thus, we identified CDH11, SMOC2, and PEDF as promising non-invasive biomarkers of kidney fibrosis.",

We performed whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing of 1,864 COVID-19 cases (713 with severe and 1,151 with mild disease) and 15,033 ancestry-matched population controls across 4 independent COVID-19 biobanks. We tested whether rare pLOF variants in these 13 genes were associated with severe COVID-19. We identified only 1 rare pLOF mutation across these genes among 713 cases with severe COVID-19 and observed no enrichment of pLOFs in severe cases compared to population controls or mild COVID-19 cases. We found no evidence of association of rare LOF variants in the 13 candidate genes with severe COVID-19 outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a slowly progressive disorder that is typically silent until late stages, but early intervention can significantly delay its progression. We designed a portable and scalable electronic CKD phenotype to facilitate early disease recognition and empower large-scale observational and genetic studies of kidney traits. The algorithm uses a combination of rule-based and machine-learning methods to automatically place patients on the staging grid of albuminuria by glomerular filtration rate (\"A-by-G\" grid). We manually validated the algorithm by 451 chart reviews across three medical systems, demonstrating overall positive predictive value of 95% for CKD cases and 97% for healthy controls. Independent case-control validation using 2350 patient records demonstrated diagnostic specificity of 97% and sensitivity of 87%. Application of the phenotype to 1.3 million patients demonstrated that over 80% of CKD cases are undetected using ICD codes alone. We also demonstrated several large-scale applications of the phenotype, including identifying stage-specific kidney disease comorbidities, in silico estimation of kidney trait heritability in thousands of pedigrees reconstructed from medical records, and biobank-based multicenter genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies.",

        "Abstract": "IgA vasculitis with nephritis (IgAVN) shares many pathogenetic features with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The purpose of this review is to describe our current understanding of the pathogenesis of pediatric IgAVN, particularly as it relates to the four-hit hypothesis for IgAN. These individual steps, i.e., hits, in the pathogenesis of IgAN are (1) elevated production of IgA1 glycoforms with some O-glycans deficient in galactose (galactose-deficient IgA1; Gd-IgA1), (2) generation of circulating IgG autoantibodies specific for Gd-IgA1, (3) formation of pathogenic circulating Gd-IgA1-containing immune complexes, and (4) kidney deposition of the Gd-IgA1-IgG immune complexes from the circulation and induction of glomerular injury. Evidence supporting the four-hit hypothesis in the pathogenesis of pediatric IgAVN is detailed. The genetics, pediatric outcomes, and kidney histopathologic features and the impact of these findings on future treatment and potential biomarkers are discussed. In summary, the evidence points to the critical roles of Gd-IgA1-IgG immune complexes and complement activation in the pathogenesis of IgAVN. Future studies are needed to characterize the features of the immune and autoimmune responses that enable progression of IgA vasculitis to IgAVN.",

        "Abstract": "Membranous nephropathy is a glomerulopathy that causes nephrotic syndrome and, in at least a third of cases, lasting end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). It is also a rare case of revolutionary changes in our understanding of the disease, that translates from scientific findings to real diagnosis and treatment recommendations in less than ten years. In this review we present: (1) a short history and traditional approach to patients with membranous nephropathy, (2) current recommendations and treatment options that have emerged in recent years, (3) findings of new studies, with a particular focus on serological/immunological methods, genomic and proteomic studies, still requiring validation. With further development in this field, membranous nephropathy may become one of the first nephrological conditions that apply a truly personalized approach with the omission of invasive measures such as kidney biopsy.",

        "Abstract": "The increasing global prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting COVID-19 disease pandemic pose significant concerns for clinical management of solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR). Wearable devices that can measure physiologic changes in biometrics including heart rate, heart rate variability, body temperature, respiratory, activity (such as steps taken per day) and sleep patterns, and blood oxygen saturation show utility for the early detection of infection before clinical presentation of symptoms. Recent algorithms developed using preliminary wearable datasets show that SARS-CoV-2 is detectable before clinical symptoms in >80% of adults. Early detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and other pathogens in SOTR, and their household members, could facilitate early interventions such as self-isolation and early clinical management of relevant infection(s). Ongoing studies testing the utility of wearable devices such as smartwatches for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other infections in the general population are reviewed here, along with the practical challenges to implementing these processes at scale in pediatric and adult SOTR, and their household members. The resources and logistics, including transplant-specific analyses pipelines to account for confounders such as polypharmacy and comorbidities, required in studies of pediatric and adult SOTR for the robust early detection of SARS-CoV-2, and other infections are also reviewed.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) are common, heterogeneous, and morbid diseases. Mechanistic characterization of CKD and AKI in patients may facilitate a precision-medicine approach to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The Kidney Precision Medicine Project aims to ethically and safely obtain kidney biopsies from participants with CKD or AKI, create a reference kidney atlas, and characterize disease subgroups to stratify patients based on molecular features of disease, clinical characteristics, and associated outcomes. An additional aim is to identify critical cells, pathways, and targets for novel therapies and preventive strategies. This project is a multicenter prospective cohort study of adults with CKD or AKI who undergo a protocol kidney biopsy for research purposes. This investigation focuses on kidney diseases that are most prevalent and therefore substantially burden the public health, including CKD attributed to diabetes or hypertension and AKI attributed to ischemic and toxic injuries. Reference kidney tissues (for example, living-donor kidney biopsies) will also be evaluated. Traditional and digital pathology will be combined with transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analysis of the kidney tissue as well as deep clinical phenotyping for supervised and unsupervised subgroup analysis and systems biology analysis. Participants will be followed prospectively for 10 years to ascertain clinical outcomes. Cell types, locations, and functions will be characterized in health and disease in an open, searchable, online kidney tissue atlas. All data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project will be made readily available for broad use by scientists, clinicians, and patients.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic Health Record (EHR) data represents a valuable resource for individualized prospective prediction of health conditions. Statistical methods have been developed to measure patient similarity using EHR data, mostly using clinical attributes. Only a handful of recent methods have combined clinical analytics with other forms of similarity analytics, and no unified framework exists yet to measure comprehensive patient similarity. Here, we developed a generic framework named Patient similarity based on Domain Fusion (PsDF). PsDF performs patient similarity assessment on each available domain data separately, and then integrate the affinity information over various domains into a comprehensive similarity metric. We used the integrated patient similarity to support outcome prediction by assigning a risk score to each patient. With extensive simulations, we demonstrated that PsDF outperformed existing risk prediction methods including a random forest classifier, a regression-based model, and a na\u00efve similarity method, especially when heterogeneous signals exist across different domains. Using PsDF and EHR data extracted from the data warehouse of Columbia University Irving Medical Center, we developed two different clinical prediction tools for two different clinical outcomes: incident cases of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) and severe aortic stenosis (AS) requiring valve replacement. We demonstrated that our new prediction method is scalable to large datasets, robust to random missingness, and generalizable to diverse clinical outcomes.",

Although this hypothesis is supported by recent findings that, in renal immunodeposits of IgA nephropathy patients, IgG is enriched for Gd-IgA1-specific autoantibodies, experimental proof is still lacking.",

        "Abstract": "The advent of personalized medicine has driven the development of novel approaches for obtaining detailed cellular and molecular information from clinical tissue samples. Tissue cytometry is a promising new technique that can be used to enumerate and characterize each cell in a tissue and, unlike flow cytometry and other single-cell techniques, does so in the context of the intact tissue, preserving spatial information that is frequently crucial to understanding a cell's physiology, function, and behavior. However, the wide-scale adoption of tissue cytometry as a research tool has been limited by the fact that published examples utilize specialized techniques that are beyond the capabilities of most laboratories. Here we describe a complete and accessible pipeline, including methods of sample preparation, microscopy, image analysis, and data analysis for large-scale three-dimensional tissue cytometry of human kidney tissues. In this workflow, multiphoton microscopy of unlabeled tissue is first conducted to collect autofluorescence and second-harmonic images. The tissue is then labeled with eight fluorescent probes, and imaged using spectral confocal microscopy. The raw 16-channel images are spectrally deconvolved into 8-channel images, and analyzed using the Volumetric Tissue Exploration and Analysis (VTEA) software developed by our group. We applied this workflow to analyze millimeter-scale tissue samples obtained from human nephrectomies and from renal biopsies from individuals diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy, generating a quantitative census of tens of thousands of cells in each. Such analyses can provide useful insights that can be linked to the biology or pathology of kidney disease. The approach utilizes common laboratory techniques, is compatible with most commercially-available confocal microscope systems and all image and data analysis is conducted using the VTEA image analysis software, which is available as a plug-in for ImageJ.",

We performed whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing of 1,934 COVID-19 cases (713 with severe and 1,221 with mild disease) and 15,251 ancestry-matched population controls across four independent COVID-19 biobanks. We then tested if rare pLOF variants in these 13 genes were associated with severe COVID-19. We identified only one rare pLOF mutation across these genes amongst 713 cases with severe COVID-19 and observed no enrichment of pLOFs in severe cases compared to population controls or mild COVID-19 cases. We find no evidence of association of rare loss-of-function variants in the proposed 13 candidate genes with severe COVID-19 outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) is a multisite study designed to improve understanding of CKD attributed to diabetes or hypertension and AKI by performing protocol-driven kidney biopsies. Study participants and their kidney tissue samples undergo state-of-the-art deep phenotyping using advanced molecular, imaging, and data analytical methods. Few patients participate in research design or concepts for discovery science. A major goal of the KPMP is to include patients as equal partners to inform the research for clinically relevant benefit. The purpose of this report is to describe patient and community engagement and the value they bring to the KPMP. Patients with CKD and AKI and clinicians from the study sites are members of the Community Engagement Committee, with representation on other KPMP committees. They participate in KPMP deliberations to address scientific, clinical, logistic, analytic, ethical, and community engagement issues. The Community Engagement Committee guides KPMP research priorities from perspectives of patients and clinicians. Patients led development of essential study components, including the informed consent process, no-fault harm insurance coverage, the ethics statement, return of results plan, a \"Patient Primer\" for scientists and the public, and Community Advisory Boards. As members across other KPMP committees, the Community Engagement Committee assures that the science is developed and conducted in a manner relevant to study participants and the clinical community. Patients have guided the KPMP to produce research aligned with their priorities. The Community Engagement Committee partnership has set new benchmarks for patient leadership in precision medicine research.",

        "Abstract": "Over the past decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have emerged as a powerful tool to understand the genetic basis of complex traits in humans. The GWAS approach has been successfully applied to primary glomerular disorders, providing numerous novel insights into the genetic architecture of IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. IgA nephropathy appears to have a highly complex polygenic architecture, with nearly 20 genome-wide significant loci of small-to-moderate effects discovered to date. In contrast, the genetic susceptibility to membranous nephropathy and steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome appears to be driven by a small number of large-effect loci. The MHC locus on chromosome 6p21 is strongly associated with genetic susceptibility to all major types of immune-mediated glomerulopathies. However, a distinct set of classical HLA alleles is associated with each individual disease type, pinpointing to specific immune mechanisms underlying each of these conditions. Additional insights from the discovery of non-HLA risk loci reinforced the role of innate and adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis of these disorders, and highlighted important susceptibility overlaps between glomerular and other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Despite these initial successes, much larger GWAS and sequencing studies are still needed for each individual glomerular disease type. Increased power will be critical to comprehensively test for genetic effects across the full spectrum of allelic frequencies, to detect gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, and to potentially improve the performance of polygenic risk predictors. Moreover, the existing studies are limited mostly to European and East Asian populations, stressing the urgency to expand genetic discovery efforts to more diverse populations worldwide.",

        "Abstract": "IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is thought to involve an autoimmune process wherein galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1), recognized as autoantigen by autoantibodies, forms pathogenic immune complexes. Mounting evidence has implicated abnormal activation of some protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in IgAN. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of IgAN provided insight into disease pathobiology and genetics. A GWAS locus on chromosome 22q12 contains genes encoding leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M, interleukin (IL)-6-related cytokines implicated in mucosal immunity and inflammation. We have previously shown that IL-6 mediates overproduction of Gd-IgA1 through aberrant STAT3 activation. Here, we show that LIF enhanced production of Gd-IgA1 in IgA1-secreting cells of patients with IgAN and provide initial analyses of LIF signaling.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of functional regions in the noncoding human genome is difficult but critical in order to gain understanding of the role noncoding variation plays in gene regulation in human health and disease. We describe here a co-localization approach that aims to identify constrained sequences that co-localize with tissue- or cell-type-specific regulatory regions, and we show that the resulting score is particularly well suited for the identification of rare regulatory variants. For 127 tissues and cell types in the ENCODE/Roadmap Epigenomics Project, we provide catalogs of putative tissue- or cell-type-specific regulatory regions under sequence constraint. We use the newly developed co-localization score for brain tissues to score de novo mutations in whole genomes from 1,902 individuals affected with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their unaffected siblings in the Simons Simplex Collection. We show that noncoding de novo mutations near genes co-expressed in midfetal brain with high confidence ASD risk genes, and near FMRP gene targets are more likely to be in co-localized regions if they occur in ASD probands versus in their unaffected siblings. We also observed a similar enrichment for mutations near lincRNAs, previously shown to co-express with ASD risk genes. Additionally, we provide strong evidence that prioritized de\u00a0novo mutations in autism probands point to a small set of well-known ASD genes, the disruption of which produces relevant mouse phenotypes such as abnormal social investigation and abnormal discrimination/associative learning, unlike the de novo mutations in unaffected siblings. The genome-wide co-localization results are available online.",

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the number of kidney transplants performed continues to rise every year, straining the procurement of deceased and living kidney allografts and health systems. Genome-wide genotyping and sequencing of diseased populations have uncovered genetic contributors in substantial proportions of ESRD patients. A number of these discoveries are beginning to be utilized in risk stratification and clinical management of patients. Specifically, genetics can provide insight into the primary cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), the risk of progression to ESRD, and post-transplant outcomes, including various forms of allograft rejection. The International Genetics & Translational Research in Transplantation Network (iGeneTRAiN), is a multi-site consortium that encompasses >45 genetic studies with genome-wide genotyping from over 51,000 transplant samples, including genome-wide data from >30 kidney transplant cohorts (n = 28,015). iGeneTRAiN is statistically powered to capture both rare and common genetic contributions to ESRD and post-transplant outcomes. The primary cause of ESRD is often difficult to ascertain, especially where formal biopsy diagnosis is not performed, and is unavailable in \u223c2% to >20% of kidney transplant recipients in iGeneTRAiN studies. We overview our current copy number variant (CNV) screening approaches from genome-wide genotyping datasets in iGeneTRAiN, in attempts to discover and validate genetic contributors to CKD and ESRD. Greater aggregation and analyses of well phenotyped patients with genome-wide datasets will undoubtedly yield insights into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of CKD, leading the way to improved diagnostic precision in nephrology.",

Two known risk variants in the APOL1 (apolipoprotein L1) gene predispose to kidney disease and are found almost exclusively in persons of African ancestry. APOL1 risk variants are considered, including whether clinicians should incorporate genetic testing in the screening process for living kidney donors. In addition to APOL1 testing, the role of diagnostic exome sequencing in evaluating potential transplant recipients and donors with a positive family history of kidney disease is discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Many bioinformatics methods have been proposed for reducing the complexity of large gene or protein networks into relevant subnetworks or modules. Yet, how such methods compare to each other in terms of their ability to identify disease-relevant modules in different types of network remains poorly understood. We launched the 'Disease Module Identification DREAM Challenge', an open competition to comprehensively assess module identification methods across diverse protein-protein interaction, signaling, gene co-expression, homology and cancer-gene networks. Predicted network modules were tested for association with complex traits and diseases using a unique collection of 180 genome-wide association studies. Our robust assessment of 75 module identification methods reveals top-performing algorithms, which recover complementary trait-associated modules. We find that most of these modules correspond to core disease-relevant pathways, which often comprise therapeutic targets. This community challenge establishes biologically interpretable benchmarks, tools and guidelines for molecular network analysis to study human disease biology.",

        "Abstract": "The advancement of precision medicine requires new methods to coordinate and deliver genetic data from heterogeneous sources to physicians and patients. The eMERGE III Network enrolled >25,000 participants from biobank and prospective cohorts of predominantly healthy individuals for clinical genetic testing to determine clinically actionable findings. The network developed protocols linking together the 11 participant collection sites and 2 clinical genetic testing laboratories. DNA capture panels targeting 109 genes were used for testing of DNA and sample collection, data generation, interpretation, reporting, delivery, and storage were each harmonized. A compliant and secure network enabled ongoing review and reconciliation of clinical interpretations, while maintaining communication and data sharing between clinicians and investigators. A total of 202 individuals had positive diagnostic findings relevant to the indication for testing and 1,294 had additional/secondary findings of medical significance deemed to be returnable, establishing data return rates for other testing endeavors. This study accomplished integration of structured genomic results into multiple electronic health record (EHR) systems, setting the stage for clinical decision support to enable genomic medicine. Further, the established processes enable different sequencing sites to harmonize technical and interpretive aspects of sequencing tests, a critical achievement toward global standardization of genomic testing. The eMERGE protocols and tools are available for widespread dissemination.",

        "Abstract": "The acute loss of kidney function has been diagnosed for many decades using the serum concentration of creatinine - a muscle metabolite that is an insensitive and non-specific marker of kidney function, but is now used for the very definition of acute kidney injury (AKI). Fortunately, myriad new tools have now been developed to better understand the relationship between acute tubular injury and elevation in serum creatinine (SCr). These tools include unbiased gene and protein expression analyses in kidney, urine and blood, the localization of specific gene transcripts in pathological biopsy samples by rapid in-situ RNA technology and single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses. However, this molecular approach to AKI has produced a series of unexpected problems, because the expression of specific kidney-derived molecules that are indicative of injury often do not correlate with SCr levels. This discrepancy between kidney injury markers and SCr level can be reconciled by the recognition that many separate subtypes of AKI exist, each with distinct patterning of molecular markers of tubular injury and SCr data. In this Review, we describe the weaknesses of isolated SCr-based diagnoses, the clinical and molecular subtyping of acute tubular injury, and the role of non-invasive biomarkers in clinical phenotyping. We propose a conceptual model that synthesizes molecular and physiological data along a time course spanning from acute cellular injury to organ failure.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic health records (EHR) are valuable to define phenotype selection algorithms used to identify cohorts ofpatients for sequencing or genome wide association studies (GWAS). To date, the electronic medical records and genomics (eMERGE) network institutions have developed and applied such algorithms to identify cohorts with associated DNA samples used to discover new genetic associations. For complex diseases, there are benefits to stratifying cohorts using comorbidities in order to identify their genetic determinants. The objective of this study was to: (a) characterize comorbidities in a range of phenotype-selected cohorts using the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups\u00ae (ACG\u00ae) System, (b) assess the frequency of important comorbidities in three commonly studied GWAS phenotypes, and (c) compare the comorbidity characterization of cases and controls. Our analysis demonstrates a framework to characterize comorbidities using the ACG system and identified differences in mean chronic condition count among GWAS cases and controls. Thus, we believe there is great potential to use the ACG system to characterize comorbidities among genetic cohorts selected based on EHR phenotypes.",

        "Abstract": "Medicine has long sought to match diagnostic and treatment approaches to the particular needs and risks of individual patients. The decreasing cost and increasing ease of genetic sequencing have propelled the rise of precision medicine. Precision medicine aims to use genetic and other information to provide care tailored to the individual patient, with the goal of improving clinical outcomes and minimizing unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Although developments in genetic sequencing have the potential to transform clinical care, there are important limitations, including uncertainty in the clinical interpretation of many genetic variants and concerns about privacy, discrimination, and cost. To help clinicians understand the basics of genetic sequencing and how to apply it in clinical practice, Annals of Internal Medicine is launching a new \"Precision Medicine\" series. This introduction provides a general overview of clinical sequencing, with a focus on germline variation. Subsequent articles will use a case-based format to provide concise summaries of specific clinical precision medicine scenarios that are relevant to the practice of internal medicine. These cases will highlight specific clinical indications; interpretation of genetic test results; and ethical, legal, cost, and privacy issues related to genetic testing. The goal is to provide practical information on the appropriate application and interpretation of genomics in routine clinical practice.",

Given the rise in public interest in human genetics and precision medicine, direct-to-consumer genetic testing is becoming increasingly popular, and clinicians should expect patients to present the results of these tests more frequently. This article uses a case scenario to provide information about what the results of these tests mean, and what they do not mean.",

        "Abstract": "There is scant literature describing the effect of glomerular disease on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The Cure Glomerulonephropathy study (CureGN) is an international longitudinal cohort study of children and adults with four primary glomerular diseases (minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and IgA nephropathy). HRQOL is systematically assessed using items from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Informative System (PROMIS). We assessed the relationship between HRQOL and demographic and clinical variables in 478 children and 1115 adults at the time of enrollment into CureGN. Domains measured by PROMIS items included global assessments of health, mobility, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep impairment, as well as a derived composite measure incorporating all measured domains. Multivariable models were created that explained 7 to 32% of variance in HRQOL. Patient-reported edema consistently had the strongest and most robust association with each measured domain of HRQOL in multivariable analysis (adjusted \u03b2 [95% CI] for composite PROMIS score in children, -5.2 [-7.1 to -3.4]; for composite PROMIS score in adults, -6.1 [-7.4 to -4.9]). Female sex, weight (particularly obesity), and estimated glomerular filtration rate were also associated with some, but not all, domains of HRQOL. Primary diagnosis, disease duration, and exposure to immunosuppression were not associated with HRQOL after adjustment. Sensitivity analyses and interaction testing demonstrated no significant association between disease duration or immunosuppression and any measured domain of HRQOL. Thus, patient-reported edema has a consistent negative association with HRQOL in patients with primary glomerular diseases, with substantially greater impact than other demographic and clinical variables.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects ~10% of the global population, with considerable ethnic differences in prevalence and aetiology. We assemble genome-wide association studies of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function that defines CKD, in 312,468 individuals of diverse ancestry. We identify 127 distinct association signals with homogeneous effects on eGFR across ancestries and enrichment in genomic annotations including kidney-specific histone modifications. Fine-mapping reveals 40 high-confidence variants driving eGFR associations and highlights putative causal genes with cell-type specific expression in glomerulus, and in\u00a0proximal and distal nephron. Mendelian randomisation supports causal effects of eGFR on overall and cause-specific CKD, kidney stone formation, diastolic blood pressure and hypertension. These results define novel molecular mechanisms and putative causal genes for eGFR, offering insight into clinical outcomes and routes to CKD treatment development.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are a major cause of pediatric kidney failure. We performed a genome-wide analysis of copy number variants (CNVs) in 2,824 cases and 21,498 controls. Affected individuals carried a significant burden of rare exonic (that is, affecting coding regions) CNVs and were enriched for known genomic disorders (GD). Kidney anomaly (KA) cases were most enriched for exonic CNVs, encompassing GD-CNVs and novel deletions; obstructive uropathy (OU) had a lower CNV burden and an intermediate prevalence of GD-CNVs; and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) had the fewest GD-CNVs but was enriched for novel exonic CNVs, particularly duplications. Six loci (1q21, 4p16.1-p16.3, 16p11.2, 16p13.11, 17q12 and 22q11.2) accounted for 65% of patients with GD-CNVs. Deletions at 17q12, 4p16.1-p16.3 and 22q11.2 were specific for KA; the 16p11.2 locus showed extensive pleiotropy. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we identified TBX6 as a driver for the CAKUT subphenotypes in the 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Proteomic approaches allow measurement of thousands of proteins in a single specimen, which can accelerate biomarker discovery. However, applying these technologies to massive biobanks is not currently feasible because of the practical barriers and costs of implementing such assays at scale. To overcome these challenges, we used a \"virtual proteomic\" approach, linking genetically predicted protein levels to clinical diagnoses in >40\u2009000 individuals.",

Challenges to identifying underlying mechanisms, biomarkers, and new therapies include the rarity of each diagnosis and slow progression, often requiring decades to measure the effectiveness of interventions to prevent end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or death.",

        "Abstract": "The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network is a network of medical centers with electronic medical records linked to existing biorepository samples for genomic discovery and genomic medicine research. The network sought to unify the genetic results from 78 Illumina and Affymetrix genotype array batches from 12 contributing medical centers for joint association analysis of 83,717 human participants. In this report, we describe the imputation of eMERGE results and methods to create the unified imputed merged set of genome-wide variant genotype data. We imputed the data using the Michigan Imputation Server, which provides a missing single-nucleotide variant genotype imputation service using the minimac3 imputation algorithm with the Haplotype Reference Consortium genotype reference set. We describe the quality control and filtering steps used in the generation of this data set and suggest generalizable quality thresholds for imputation and phenotype association studies. To test the merged imputed genotype set, we replicated a previously reported chromosome 6 HLA-B herpes zoster (shingles) association and discovered a novel zoster-associated loci in an epigenetic binding site near the terminus of chromosome 3 (3p29).",

        "Abstract": "Collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (cFSGS) in the native kidney is associated with heavy proteinuria and accelerated renal failure. However, cFSGS in the renal allograft is less well characterized. Here we report clinico-pathologic features and APOL1 donor risk genotypes in 38 patients with de novo post-kidney transplant cFSGS. Recipients were 34% female and 26% African American. Concurrent viral infections and acute vaso-occlusion (including thrombotic microangiopathy, cortical necrosis, atheroembolization, and cardiac arrest with contralateral graft thrombosis) were present in 13% and 29% of recipients, respectively. Notably, 61% of patients had concurrent acute rejection and 47% received grafts from African American donors, of which 53% carried APOL1 high-risk genotypes. These frequencies of acute rejection and grafts from African American donors were significantly higher than in our general transplant population (35% and 16%, respectively). Patients had a median serum creatinine of 5.4 mg/dl, urine protein/creatinine 3.5 g/g, and 18% had nephrotic syndrome. Graft failure occurred in 63% of patients at an average of eighteen months post-index biopsy. By univariate analysis, donor APOL1 high-risk genotypes, post-transplant time, nephrotic syndrome, and chronic histologic changes were associated with inferior graft survival while acute vaso-occlusion was associated with superior graft survival. Donor APOL1 high-risk genotypes independently predicted poor outcome. Compared to native kidney cFSGS, post-transplant cFSGS had more acute vaso-occlusion but less proteinuria. Thus, de novo cFSGS is associated with variable proteinuria and poor prognosis with potential predisposing factors of African American donor, acute rejection, viral infection and acute vaso-occlusion. Additionally, donor APOL1 high-risk genotypes are associated with higher incidence and worse graft survival.",

        "Abstract": "IgA nephropathy (IgAN) represents a genetically complex multifactorial trait. Its prevalence and clinical features vary geographically, and the disease has a range of clinical presentations that suggest multiple subtypes. Although familial aggregation of IgAN has been reported and prior linkage studies have highlighted significant locus heterogeneity, specific genetic variants underlying familial IgAN have not yet been defined. Population-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered nearly 20 IgAN risk loci, providing novel insights into disease epidemiology and molecular mechanisms, shifting old paradigms of the disease pathogenesis. Follow-up fine-mapping studies have identified specific causal variants, and genotype-phenotype correlation studies have begun to delineate clinical consequences of GWAS risk alleles. The association between IgAN and galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1), a validated serum biomarker of IgAN, presented another avenue for genetic discovery because elevated serum levels of Gd-IgA1 are highly heritable. Recent GWAS for serum Gd-IgA1 levels provided novel insights into genetic regulation of this trait, but the genetic link between Gd-IgA1 and IgAN has not yet been established. In this review, we discuss these developments in the broader context of modern genetic approaches to complex traits, and provide our perspective on the critical challenges that need to be addressed to advance the field.",

        "Abstract": "Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies illuminate the genetics of gene expression and, in disease research, can be particularly illuminating when using the tissues directly impacted by the condition. In nephrology, there is a paucity of eQTL studies of human kidney. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and microdissected glomerular (GLOM) and tubulointerstitial (TI) transcriptomes from 187 individuals with nephrotic syndrome (NS) to describe the eQTL landscape in these functionally distinct kidney structures. Using MatrixEQTL, we performed cis-eQTL analysis on GLOM (n = 136) and TI (n = 166). We used the Bayesian \"Deterministic Approximation of Posteriors\" (DAP) to fine-map these signals, eQTLBMA to discover GLOM- or TI-specific eQTLs, and single-cell RNA-seq data of control kidney tissue to identify the cell type specificity of significant eQTLs. We integrated eQTL data with an IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) GWAS to perform a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). We discovered 894 GLOM eQTLs and 1,767\u00a0TI eQTLs at FDR < 0.05. 14% and 19% of GLOM and TI eQTLs, respectively, had >1 independent signal associated with its expression. 12% and 26% of eQTLs were GLOM specific and TI specific, respectively. GLOM eQTLs were most significantly enriched in podocyte transcripts and TI eQTLs in proximal tubules. The IgAN TWAS identified significant GLOM and TI genes, primarily at the HLA region. In this study, we discovered GLOM and TI eQTLs, identified those that were tissue specific, deconvoluted them into cell-specific signals, and used them to characterize known GWAS alleles. These data are available for browsing and download via our eQTL browser, \"nephQTL.\"",

        "Abstract": "The presence of 2 APOL1 risk variants (G1/G1, G1/G2, or G2/G2) is an important predictor of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and chronic kidney disease in individuals of African descent. Although recipient APOL1 genotype is not associated with allograft survival, kidneys from deceased African American donors with 2 APOL1 risk variants demonstrate shorter graft survival. We present a series of cases of presumed de novo collapsing FSGS in 5 transplanted kidneys from 3 deceased donors later identified as carrying 2 APOL1 risk alleles, including 2 recipients from the same donor whose kidneys were transplanted in 2 different institutions. Four of these recipients had viremia in the period preceding the diagnosis of collapsing FSGS. Cytomegalovirus and BK virus infection were present in 3 and 1 of our 5 cases, respectively, around the time that collapsing FSGS occurred. We discuss viral infections, including active cytomegalovirus infection, as possible \"second hits\" that may lead to glomerular injury and allograft failure in these recipients. Further studies to identify additional second hits are necessary to better understand the pathologic mechanisms of donor APOL1-associated kidney disease in the recipient.",

        "Abstract": "Genomic medicine is moving from research to the clinic. There is a lack of evidence about the impact of genomic medicine interventions on health outcomes. This is due in part to a lack of standardized outcome measures that can be used across different programs to evaluate the impact of interventions targeted to specific genetic conditions. The eMERGE Outcomes working group (OWG) developed measures to collect information on outcomes following the return of genomic results to participants for several genetic disorders. These outcomes were compared to outcome intervention pairs for genetic disorders developed independently by the ClinGen Actionability working group (AWG). In general, there was concordance between the defined outcomes between the two groups. The ClinGen outcomes tended to be from a higher level and the AWG scored outcomes represented a subset of outcomes referenced in the accompanying AWG evidence review. eMERGE OWG outcomes were more detailed and discrete, facilitating a collection of relevant information from the health records. This paper demonstrates that common outcomes for genomic medicine interventions can be identified. Further work is needed to standardize outcomes across genomic medicine implementation projects and to make these publicly available to enhance dissemination and assist in making precision public health a reality.",

        "Abstract": "Integration of detailed phenotype information with genetic data is well established to facilitate accurate diagnosis of hereditary disorders. As a rich source of phenotype information, electronic health records (EHRs) promise to empower diagnostic variant interpretation. However, how to accurately and efficiently extract phenotypes from heterogeneous EHR narratives remains a challenge. Here, we present EHR-Phenolyzer, a high-throughput EHR framework for extracting and analyzing phenotypes. EHR-Phenolyzer extracts and normalizes Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts from EHR narratives and then prioritizes genes with causal variants on the basis of the HPO-coded phenotype manifestations. We assessed EHR-Phenolyzer on 28 pediatric individuals with confirmed diagnoses of monogenic diseases and found that the genes with causal variants were ranked among the top 100 genes selected by EHR-Phenolyzer for 16/28 individuals (p < 2.2\u00a0\u00d7 10",

        "Abstract": "Heritability is essential for understanding the biological causes of disease but requires laborious patient recruitment and phenotype ascertainment. Electronic health records (EHRs) passively capture a wide range of clinically relevant data and provide a resource for studying the heritability of traits that are not typically accessible. EHRs contain next-of-kin information collected via patient emergency contact forms, but until now, these data have gone unused in research. We mined emergency contact data at three academic medical centers and identified 7.4 million familial relationships while maintaining patient privacy. Identified relationships were consistent with genetically derived relatedness. We used EHR data to compute heritability estimates for 500 disease phenotypes. Overall, estimates were consistent with the literature and between sites. Inconsistencies were indicative of limitations and opportunities unique to EHR research. These analyses provide a validation of the use of EHRs for genetics and disease research.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a method based on a latent Dirichlet\u00a0allocation model for predicting functional effects of noncoding genetic variants in a cell-type- and/or tissue-specific way (FUN-LDA). Using this unsupervised approach, we predict tissue-specific functional effects for every position in the human genome in 127 different tissues and cell types. We demonstrate the usefulness of our predictions by using several validation experiments. Using eQTL data from several sources, including the GTEx project, Geuvadis project, and TwinsUK cohort, we show that eQTLs in specific tissues tend to be most enriched among the predicted functional variants in relevant tissues in Roadmap. We further show how these integrated functional scores can be used for (1) deriving the most likely cell or tissue type causally implicated for a complex trait by using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies and (2) estimating a tissue-based correlation matrix of various complex traits. We found large enrichment of heritability in functional components of relevant tissues for various complex traits, and FUN-LDA yielded higher enrichment estimates than existing methods. Finally, using experimentally validated functional variants from the literature and variants possibly implicated in disease by previous studies, we rigorously compare FUN-LDA with state-of-the-art functional annotation methods and show that FUN-LDA has better prediction accuracy and higher resolution than these methods. In particular, our results suggest that tissue- and cell-type-specific functional prediction methods tend to have substantially better prediction accuracy than organism-level prediction methods. Scores for each position in the human genome and for each ENCODE and Roadmap tissue are available online (see Web Resources).",

        "Abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) currently is diagnosed by a temporal trend of a single blood analyte: serum creatinine. This measurement is neither sensitive nor specific to kidney injury or its protean forms. Newer biomarkers, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL, Lipocalin 2, Siderocalin), or kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1, Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 1), accelerate the diagnosis of AKI as well as prospectively distinguish rapidly reversible from prolonged causes of serum creatinine increase. Nonetheless, these biomarkers lack the capacity to subfractionate AKI further (eg, sepsis versus ischemia versus nephrotoxicity from medications, enzymes, or metals) or inform us about the primary and secondary sites of injury. It also is unknown whether all nephrons are injured in AKI, whether all cells in a nephron are affected, and whether injury responses can be stimulus-specific or cell type-specific or both. In this review, we summarize fully agnostic tissue interrogation approaches that may help to redefine AKI in cellular and molecular terms, including single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing technology. These approaches will empower a shift in the current paradigm of AKI diagnosis, classification, and staging, and provide the renal community with a significant advance toward precision medicine in the analysis AKI.",

        "Abstract": "Renal agenesis and hypodysplasia (RHD) are major causes of pediatric chronic kidney disease and are highly genetically heterogeneous. We conducted whole-exome sequencing in 202 case subjects with RHD and identified diagnostic mutations in genes known to be associated with RHD in 7/202 case subjects. In an additional affected individual with RHD and a congenital heart defect, we found a homozygous loss-of-function (LOF) variant in SLIT3, recapitulating phenotypes reported with Slit3 inactivation in the mouse. To identify genes associated with RHD, we performed an exome-wide association study with 195 unresolved case subjects and 6,905 control subjects. The top signal resided in GREB1L, a gene implicated previously in Hoxb1 and Shha signaling in zebrafish. The significance of the association, which was p = 2.0\u00a0\u00d7 10",

        "Title": "GWAS for serum galactose-deficient IgA1 implicates critical genes of the O-glycosylation pathway.",
        "Abstract": "Aberrant O-glycosylation of serum immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) represents a heritable pathogenic defect in IgA nephropathy, the most common form of glomerulonephritis worldwide, but specific genetic factors involved in its determination are not known. We performed a quantitative GWAS for serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) in 2,633 subjects of European and East Asian ancestry and discovered two genome-wide significant loci, in C1GALT1 (rs13226913, P = 3.2 x 10-11) and C1GALT1C1 (rs5910940, P = 2.7 x 10-8). These genes encode molecular partners essential for enzymatic O-glycosylation of IgA1. We demonstrated that these two loci explain approximately 7% of variability in circulating Gd-IgA1 in Europeans, but only 2% in East Asians. Notably, the Gd-IgA1-increasing allele of rs13226913 is common in Europeans, but rare in East Asians. Moreover, rs13226913 represents a strong cis-eQTL for C1GALT1 that encodes the key enzyme responsible for the transfer of galactose to O-linked glycans on IgA1. By in vitro siRNA knock-down studies, we confirmed that mRNA levels of both C1GALT1 and C1GALT1C1 determine the rate of secretion of Gd-IgA1 in IgA1-producing cells. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of O-glycosylation and are relevant not only to IgA nephropathy, but also to other complex traits associated with O-glycosylation defects, including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic disease, and cancer.",

        "Abstract": "An intronic variant at the complement factor H (CFH) gene on chromosome 1q32 (rs6677604) associates with risk of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), but the association signal has not been uniformly replicated in Han Chinese populations. We investigated whether the causal sequence variant resides in the CFH gene or the neighboring complement factor H-related 1 (CFHR1) gene and CFHR3, which harbor an 84-kb combined deletion (CFHR3,1\u0394) in linkage disequilibrium with rs6677604. Imputation of 1000 Genomes Project data did not suggest new causal single-nucleotide variants within the CFH cluster. We next performed copy number analysis across the CFH locus in two independent Han Chinese case-control cohorts (combined n=3581). The CFHR3,1\u0394 and rs6677604-A alleles were rare (4.4% in patients and 7.1% in controls) and in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other (r",

        "Abstract": "Using publicly available data from inbred mouse strains, we conducted a genome-wide association study to identify loci that accounted for liver-related phenotypes between C57BL/6J and A/J mice fed a Paigen diet. We confirmed genome-wide significant associations for hepatic cholesterol (chromosome 10A2) and serum total bile acid concentration (chromosome 12E) and identified a new locus for liver inflammation (chromosome 7C). Analysis of consomic mice confirmed that chromosome 12 A/J alleles accounted for the variance in serum total bile acid concentrations and had pleiotropic effects on liver mass, serum cholesterol, and serum alanine aminotransferase activity. Using an affected-only haplotype analysis among strains, we refined the chromosome 12E signal to a 1.95 Mb linkage disequilibrium block containing only one gene, sel-1 suppressor of lin-12-like (Sel1l). RNA sequencing and immunoblotting demonstrated that the risk allele locally conferred reduced expression of SEL1L in liver and distantly down-regulated pathways associated with hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox A (Hnf1a) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (Hnf4a), known modifiers of bile acid transporters and metabolic traits. Consistent with these data, knockdown of SEL1L in HepG2 cells resulted in reduced HNF1A and HNF4A and increased bile acids in culture media; it further captured multiple molecular signatures observed in consomic mouse livers with reduced SEL1L. Finally, dogs harboring a SEL1L mutation and Sel1l(+/-) mice fed a Paigen diet had significantly increased serum total bile acid concentrations, providing independent confirmation linking SEL1L to bile acid metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "Recent years have brought notable progress in the field of IgA nephropathy. Here, we highlight important new directions and latest developments, including successful discovery of several genetic susceptibility loci, formulation of the multihit pathogenesis model, introduction of the Oxford pathology scoring system, and formalization of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consensus treatment guidelines. We focus on the latest genetic findings that confirm a strong contribution of inherited factors and explain some of the geoethnic disparities in disease susceptibility. Most IgA nephropathy susceptibility loci discovered to date encode genes involved in the maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier and response to mucosal pathogens. The concerted pattern of interpopulation allelic differentiation across all genetic loci parallels the disease prevalence and correlates with variation in local pathogens, suggesting that multilocus adaptation might have shaped the present-day landscape of IgA nephropathy. Importantly, the 'Intestinal Immune Network for IgA Production' emerged as one of the new targets for potential therapeutic intervention. We place these findings in the context of the multihit pathogenesis model and existing knowledge of IgA immunobiology. Lastly, we provide our perspective on the existing treatment options, discuss areas of clinical uncertainty, and outline ongoing clinical trials and translational studies.",

        "Title": "Novel mutations in the inverted formin 2 gene of Chinese families contribute to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.",
        "Abstract": "Here, we report a genetic study of an extended family of Chinese ancestry with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), with one of the affected members also concurrently diagnosed with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). By genome-wide linkage analysis and subsequent sequencing, we identified an S85W mutation in the inverted formin 2 (INF2) gene that perfectly cosegregated with the kidney disease phenotype. The entire INF2 coding region was sequenced in 200 healthy controls, 55 families with FSGS, and 34 families with IgAN. This analysis identified a novel insertion, S129_Q130insVRQLS, in another FSGS pedigree. In vitro studies found that \u03b1-actinin 4 expression was decreased and INF2 showed perinuclear localization in S85W-transfected podocytes. Phosphorylation of serum response factor, and that its nuclear translation was decreased in S85W podocytes, indicated decreased activation in mutants. Abnormal actin organization was also found in S85W podocytes, while no change of microtubule structure was observed. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence found decreased interaction between INF2 and Cdc42 in S85W podocytes. However, all these changes were not found in S129_Q130insVRQLS podocytes. The overall frequency of INF2 mutations was ~3.6% among Chinese familial FSGS, which was considerably lower than that from studies of European FSGS families. Thus, S85W but not the S129_Q130insVRQLS variant leads to podocyte cytoskeletal abnormalities, probably by impaired serum response factor phosphorylation.",

        "Abstract": "Complement activation has a role in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, an autoimmune disease mediated by pathogenic immune complexes consisting of galactose-deficient IgA1 bound by antiglycan antibodies. Of three complement-activation pathways, the alternative and lectin pathways are involved in IgA nephropathy. IgA1 can activate both pathways in vitro, and pathway components are present in the mesangial immunodeposits, including properdin and factor H in the alternative pathway and mannan-binding lectin, mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases 1 and 2, and C4d in the lectin pathway. Genome-wide association studies identified deletion of complement factor H-related genes 1 and 3 as protective against the disease. Because the corresponding gene products compete with factor H in the regulation of the alternative pathway, it has been hypothesized that the absence of these genes could lead to more potent inhibition of complement by factor H. Complement activation can take place directly on IgA1-containing immune complexes in circulation and/or after their deposition in the mesangium. Notably, complement factors and their fragments may serve as biomarkers of IgA nephropathy in serum, urine, or renal tissue. A better understanding of the role of complement in IgA nephropathy may provide potential targets and rationale for development of complement-targeting therapy of the disease.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity is heritable and predisposes to many diseases. To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-8)), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for \u223c2.7% of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for >20% of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Body fat distribution is a heritable trait and a well-established predictor of adverse metabolic outcomes, independent of overall adiposity. To increase our understanding of the genetic basis of body fat distribution and its molecular links to cardiometabolic traits, here we conduct genome-wide association meta-analyses of traits related to waist and hip circumferences in up to 224,459 individuals. We identify 49 loci (33 new) associated with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index (BMI), and an additional 19 loci newly associated with related waist and hip circumference measures (P\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-8)). In total, 20 of the 49 waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI loci show significant sexual dimorphism, 19 of which display a stronger effect in women. The identified loci were enriched for genes expressed in adipose tissue and for putative regulatory elements in adipocytes. Pathway analyses implicated adipogenesis, angiogenesis, transcriptional regulation and insulin resistance as processes affecting fat distribution, providing insight into potential pathophysiological mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a histologically identifiable glomerular injury often leading to proteinuria and renal failure. To identify its causal genes, whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing were performed on a large Chinese cohort that comprised 40 FSGS families, 50 sporadic FSGS patients, 9 independent autosomal recessive Alport's syndrome (ARAS) patients, and 190 ethnically matched healthy controls. Patients with extrarenal manifestations, indicating systemic diseases or other known hereditary renal diseases, were excluded. Heterozygous COL4A3 mutations were identified in five (12.5%) FSGS families and one (2%) sporadic FSGS patient. All identified mutations disrupted highly conserved protein sequences and none of them was found in either public databases or the 190 healthy controls. Of the FSGS patients with heterozygous COL4A3 mutations, segmental thinning of the glomerular base membrane (GBM) was only detected in the patient with electronic microscopy examination results available. Five ARAS patients (55.6%) had homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in COL4A3 or COL4A4. Serious changes in the GBM, hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities were found in 100%, 80%, and 40% of the ARAS patients, respectively. Overall, a new subgroup of FSGS patients resulting from heterozygous COL4A3 mutations was identified. The mutations are relatively frequent in families diagnosed with inherited forms of FSGS. Thus, we suggest screening for COL4A3 mutations in familial FSGS patients.",

        "Title": "Discovery of new risk loci for IgA nephropathy implicates genes involved in immunity against intestinal pathogens.",
        "Abstract": "We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common form of glomerulonephritis, with discovery and follow-up in 20,612 individuals of European and East Asian ancestry. We identified six new genome-wide significant associations, four in ITGAM-ITGAX, VAV3 and CARD9 and two new independent signals at HLA-DQB1 and DEFA. We replicated the nine previously reported signals, including known SNPs in the HLA-DQB1 and DEFA loci. The cumulative burden of risk alleles is strongly associated with age at disease onset. Most loci are either directly associated with risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier and response to mucosal pathogens. The geospatial distribution of risk alleles is highly suggestive of multi-locus adaptation, and genetic risk correlates strongly with variation in local pathogens, particularly helminth diversity, suggesting a possible role for host-intestinal pathogen interactions in shaping the genetic landscape of IgAN.",

Patients with IgAN develop characteristic IgA1-containing immune complexes that deposit in the glomerular mesangium, producing progressive kidney injury. Recent studies define IgAN as an autoimmune trait of complex architecture with a strong genetic determination.

        "Abstract": "IgA nephropathy is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Mucosal infections and food antigens, including wheat gluten, have been proposed as potential contributing environmental factors. Increased immune reactivity to gluten and/or association with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by ingestion of gluten, have been reported in IgA nephropathy. However, studies are inconsistent about this association. We aimed to evaluate the proposed link between IgA nephropathy and celiac disease or immune reactivity to gluten by conducting a comprehensive analysis of associated serologic markers in cohorts of well-characterized patients and controls. Study participants included patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy (n\u200a=\u200a99), unaffected controls of similar age, gender, and race (n\u200a=\u200a96), and patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease (n\u200a=\u200a30). All serum specimens were tested for IgG and IgA antibodies to native gliadin and deamidated gliadin, as well as IgA antibody to transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Anti-TG2 antibody-positive nephropathy patients and unaffected controls were subsequently tested for IgA anti-endomysial antibody and genotyped for celiac disease-associated HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 alleles. In comparison to unaffected controls, there was not a statistically significant increase in IgA or IgG antibody reactivity to gliadin in individuals with IgA nephropathy. In addition, the levels of celiac disease-specific serologic markers, i.e., antibodies to deamidated gliadin and TG2, did not differ between IgA nephropathy patients and unaffected controls. Results of the additional anti-endomysial antibody testing and HLA genotyping were corroborative. The data from this case-control study do not reveal any evidence to suggest a significant role for celiac disease or immune reactivity to gluten in IgA nephropathy.",

        "Abstract": "Glomerular diseases are major contributors to the global burden of end-stage kidney disease. The clinical course and outcome of these disorders are extremely variable and difficult to predict. The clinical trajectories range from a benign and spontaneously remitting condition to a symptomatic and rapidly progressive disease. The diagnosis is based entirely on the evaluation of kidney biopsy, but this invasive procedure carries multiple risks and often fails to predict the clinical course or responsiveness to treatment. However, more recent advances in genetics and molecular biology have facilitated elucidation of novel pathogenic mechanisms of these disorders. These discoveries fuel the development of novel biomarkers and offer prospects of noninvasive diagnosis and improved prognostication. Our review focuses on the most promising novel biomarkers that have recently emerged for the major types of glomerular diseases, including immunoglobulin A nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.",

        "Abstract": "The last decade has seen major progress in understanding the pathogenesis as well as the prognosis and treatment of patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Although the diagnostic criterion of a kidney biopsy demonstrating dominant or codominant IgA deposition remains unchanged, much more is known about the genetic and environmental factors predisposing to disease development and progression. These advances have led to the identification of novel diagnostic and prognostic markers. Among the most promising clinically are genetic profiling, quantification of galactose-deficient IgA1 levels, and measurement of anti-IgA1 immunoglobulins. While targeted treatment for IgAN remains elusive, there is mounting evidence for therapeutic interventions that alter the disease course. The appropriate validation and integration of these discoveries into clinical care represent a major challenge, but one that holds tremendous promise for refining prognostication, guiding therapy, and improving the lives of patients with IgAN.",

        "Title": "Copy-number disorders are a common cause of congenital kidney malformations.",
        "Abstract": "We examined the burden of large, rare, copy-number variants (CNVs) in 192 individuals with renal hypodysplasia (RHD) and replicated findings in 330 RHD cases from two independent cohorts. CNV distribution was significantly skewed toward larger gene-disrupting events in RHD cases compared to 4,733 ethnicity-matched controls (p = 4.8 \u00d7 10(-11)). This excess was attributable to known and novel (i.e., not present in any database or in the literature) genomic disorders. All together, 55/522 (10.5%) RHD cases harbored 34 distinct known genomic disorders, which were detected in only 0.2% of 13,839 population controls (p = 1.2 \u00d7 10(-58)). Another 32 (6.1%) RHD cases harbored large gene-disrupting CNVs that were absent from or extremely rare in the 13,839 population controls, identifying 38 potential novel or rare genomic disorders for this trait. Deletions at the HNF1B locus and the DiGeorge/velocardiofacial locus were most frequent. However, the majority of disorders were detected in a single individual. Genomic disorders were detected in 22.5% of individuals with multiple malformations and 14.5% of individuals with isolated urinary-tract defects; 14 individuals harbored two or more diagnostic or rare CNVs. Strikingly, the majority of the known CNV disorders detected in the RHD cohort have previous associations with developmental delay or neuropsychiatric diseases. Up to 16.6% of individuals with kidney malformations had a molecular diagnosis attributable to a copy-number disorder, suggesting kidney malformations as a sentinel manifestation of pathogenic genomic imbalances. A search for pathogenic CNVs should be considered in this population for the diagnosis of their specific genomic disorders and for the evaluation of the potential for developmental delay.",

        "Abstract": "Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple susceptibility loci for immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), the most common form of glomerulonephritis, implicating independent defects in adaptive immunity (three loci on chromosome 6p21 in the MHC region), innate immunity (8p23 DEFA locus, 17p23 TNFSF13 locus, 22q12 HORMAD2 locus), and the alternative complement pathway (1q32 CFH/CFHR locus). In geospatial analysis of 85 populations, a genetic risk score based on the replicated GWAS loci is highest in Asians, intermediate in Europeans, and lowest in Africans, capturing the known difference in prevalence among world populations. The genetic risk score also uncovered a previously unsuspected increased prevalence of IgAN-attributable kidney failure in Northern Europe. The IgAN risk alleles have opposing effects on many immune-mediated diseases, suggesting that selection has contributed to variation in risk allele frequencies among different populations. Incorporating genetic, immunologic, and biochemical data, we present a multistep pathogenesis model that provides testable hypotheses for dissecting the mechanisms of disease.",

        "Abstract": "Macular Telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) is a relatively rare macular disease of adult onset presenting with distortions in the visual field and leading to progressive loss of visual acuity. For the purpose of a gene mapping study, several pedigrees were ascertained with multiple affected family members. Seventeen families with a total of 71 individuals (including 45 affected or possibly affected) were recruited at clinical centers in 7 countries under the auspices of the MacTel Project. The disease inheritance was consistent with autosomal dominant segregation with reduced penetrance. Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed, followed by analysis of recombination breakpoints. Linkage analysis identified a single peak with multi-point LOD score of 3.45 on chromosome 1 at 1q41-42 under a dominant model. Recombination mapping defined a minimal candidate region of 15.6 Mb, from 214.32 (rs1579634; 219.96 cM) to 229.92 Mb (rs7542797; 235.07 cM), encompassing the 1q41-42 linkage peak. Sanger sequencing of the top 14 positional candidates genes under the linkage peak revealed no causal variants in these pedigrees.",

        "Title": "Geographic differences in genetic susceptibility to IgA nephropathy: GWAS replication study and geospatial risk analysis.",
        "Abstract": "IgA nephropathy (IgAN), major cause of kidney failure worldwide, is common in Asians, moderately prevalent in Europeans, and rare in Africans. It is not known if these differences represent variation in genes, environment, or ascertainment. In a recent GWAS, we localized five IgAN susceptibility loci on Chr.6p21 (HLA-DQB1/DRB1, PSMB9/TAP1, and DPA1/DPB2 loci), Chr.1q32 (CFHR3/R1 locus), and Chr.22q12 (HORMAD2 locus). These IgAN loci are associated with risk of other immune-mediated disorders such as type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or inflammatory bowel disease. We tested association of these loci in eight new independent cohorts of Asian, European, and African-American ancestry (N\u200a=\u200a4,789), followed by meta-analysis with risk-score modeling in 12 cohorts (N\u200a=\u200a10,755) and geospatial analysis in 85 world populations. Four susceptibility loci robustly replicated and all five loci were genome-wide significant in the combined cohort (P\u200a=\u200a5\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u00b2-3\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2070), with heterogeneity detected only at the PSMB9/TAP1 locus (I\u00b2\u200a=\u200a0.60). Conditional analyses identified two new independent risk alleles within the HLA-DQB1/DRB1 locus, defining multiple risk and protective haplotypes within this interval. We also detected a significant genetic interaction, whereby the odds ratio for the HORMAD2 protective allele was reversed in homozygotes for a CFHR3/R1 deletion (P\u200a=\u200a2.5\u00d710\u207b\u2074). A seven-SNP genetic risk score, which explained 4.7% of overall IgAN risk, increased sharply with Eastward and Northward distance from Africa (r\u200a=\u200a0.30, P\u200a=\u200a3\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u00b2\u2078). This model paralleled the known East-West gradient in disease risk. Moreover, the prediction of a South-North axis was confirmed by registry data showing that the prevalence of IgAN-attributable kidney failure is increased in Northern Europe, similar to multiple sclerosis and type I diabetes. Variation at IgAN susceptibility loci correlates with differences in disease prevalence among world populations. These findings inform genetic, biological, and epidemiological investigations of IgAN and permit cross-comparison with other complex traits that share genetic risk loci and geographic patterns with IgAN.",

        "Abstract": "IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Asia. In this study, based on a large cohort of Chinese patients with IgAN, we aim to identify independent predictive factors associated with disease progression to ESRD. We collected retrospective clinical data and renal outcomes on 619 biopsy-diagnosed IgAN patients with a mean follow-up time of 41.3 months. In total, 67 individuals reached the study endpoint defined by occurrence of ESRD necessitating renal replacement therapy. In the fully adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, there were four baseline variables with a significant independent effect on the risk of ESRD. These included: eGFR [HR = 0.96(0.95-0.97)], serum albumin [HR = 0.47(0.32-0.68)], hemoglobin [HR = 0.79(0.72-0.88)], and SBP [HR = 1.02(1.00-1.03)]. Based on these observations, we developed a 4-variable equation of a clinical risk score for disease progression. Our risk score explained nearly 22% of the total variance in the primary outcome. Survival ROC curves revealed that the risk score provided improved prediction of ESRD at 24th, 60th and 120th month of follow-up compared to the three previously proposed risk scores. In summary, our data indicate that IgAN patients with higher systolic blood pressure, lower eGFR, hemoglobin, and albumin levels at baseline are at a greatest risk of progression to ESRD. The new progression risk score calculated based on these four baseline variables offers a simple clinical tool for risk stratification.",

        "Abstract": "Although high serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 (an important biomarker of IgA nephropathy (IgAN)) are found in most patients with IgAN, their relationship to disease severity and progression remains unclear. To help clarify this we prospectively enrolled 275 patients with IgAN and followed them for a median of 47 months (range 12-96 months). Serum galactose-deficient IgA1 was measured at the time of diagnosis using a lectin-based ELISA, and renal survival was modeled using the Cox proportional hazards method. The serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 were higher in patients with IgAN compared to those in healthy controls. Importantly, in adjusted analysis, higher levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 were independently associated with a greater risk of deterioration in renal function with a hazard ratio of 1.44 per standard deviation of the natural log-transformed galactose-deficient IgA1 concentration. In reference to the first quartile, the risk of kidney failure increased such that the hazard ratio for the second quartile was 2.47, 3.86 for the third, and 4.76 for the fourth quartile of the galactose-deficient IgA1 concentration. Hence, elevated serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 are associated with a poor prognosis in IgAN.",

        "Abstract": "A chromosome 22q13 locus strongly associates with increased risk for idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), HIV-1-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), and hypertensive ESRD among individuals of African descent. Although initial studies implicated MYH9, more recent analyses localized the strongest association within the neighboring APOL1 gene. In this replication study, we examined the six top-most associated variants in APOL1 and MYH9 in an independent cohort of African Americans with various nephropathies (44 with FSGS, 21 with HIVAN, 32 with IgA nephropathy, and 74 healthy controls). All six variants associated with FSGS and HIVAN (additive ORs, 1.8 to 3.0; P values 3 \u00d7 10(-2) to 5 \u00d7 10(-5)) but not with IgA nephropathy. In conditional and haplotype analyses, two APOL1 haplotypes accounted for virtually all of the association with FSGS and HIVAN on chromosome 22q13 (haplotype P value = 5.6 \u00d7 10(-8)). To assess the role of MYH9 deficiency in nephropathy, we crossbred Myh9-haploinsufficient mice (Myh9(+/-)) with HIV-1 transgenic mice. Myh9(+/-) mice were healthy and did not demonstrate overt proteinuria or nephropathy, irrespective of the presence of the HIV-1 transgene. These data further support the strong association of genetic variants in APOL1 with susceptibility to FSGS and HIVAN among African Americans.",

        "Abstract": "Here we discuss recent advances in understanding the biochemical, immunologic, and genetic pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, the most common primary glomerulonephritis. Current data indicate that at least four processes contribute to development of IgA nephropathy. Patients with IgA nephropathy often have a genetically determined increase in circulating levels of IgA1 with galactose-deficient O-glycans in the hinge-region (Hit 1). This glycosylation aberrancy is, however, not sufficient to induce renal injury. Synthesis and binding of antibodies directed against galactose-deficient IgA1 are required for formation of immune complexes that accumulate in the glomerular mesangium (Hits 2 and 3). These immune complexes activate mesangial cells, inducing proliferation and secretion of extracellular matrix, cytokines, and chemokines, which result in renal injury (Hit 4). Recent genome-wide association studies identify five distinct susceptibility loci--in the MHC on chromosome 6p21, the complement factor H locus on chromosome 1q32, and in a cluster of genes on chromosome 22q22--that potentially influence these processes and contain candidate mediators of disease. The significant variation in prevalence of risk alleles among different populations may also explain some of the sizable geographic variation in disease prevalence. Elucidation of the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy provides an opportunity to develop disease-specific therapies.",

        "Abstract": "We carried out a genome-wide association study of IgA nephropathy, a major cause of kidney failure worldwide. We studied 1,194 cases and 902 controls of Chinese Han ancestry, with targeted follow up in Chinese and European cohorts comprising 1,950 cases and 1,920 controls. We identified three independent loci in the major histocompatibility complex, as well as a common deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3 at chromosome 1q32 and a locus at chromosome 22q12 that each surpassed genome-wide significance (P values for association between 1.59 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2076 and 4.84 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 and minor allele odds ratios of 0.63-0.80). These five loci explain 4-7% of the disease variance and up to a tenfold variation in interindividual risk. Many of the alleles that protect against IgA nephropathy impart increased risk for other autoimmune or infectious diseases, and IgA nephropathy risk allele frequencies closely parallel the variation in disease prevalence among Asian, European and African populations, suggesting complex selective pressures.",

        "Abstract": "Serum galactose-deficient immunoglobulin A1 (Gd-IgA1) is an inherited risk factor for adult IgA nephropathy (IgAN). In this paper, we determined the heritability of serum Gd-IgA1 levels in children with IgAN and Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), two disorders with clinical phenotypes sharing common pathogenic mechanisms. Serum Gd-IgA1 concentrations were quantified using a Helix aspersa-lectin-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As a group, 34 children with either disorder (20 with HSPN and 14 with IgAN) had significantly higher Gd-IgA1 levels compared with 51 age- and ethnicity-matched pediatric controls. Serum levels of Gd-IgA1 were also elevated in a large fraction of 54 first-degree relatives of pediatric IgAN and HSPN patients compared with 141 unrelated healthy adult controls. A unilineal transmission of the trait was found in 17, bilineal transmission in 1, and sporadic occurrence in 5 of 23 families when both parents and the patient were analyzed. There was a significant age-, gender-, and household-adjusted heritability of serum galactose-deficient IgA1 estimated at 76% in pediatric IgAN and at 64% in HSPN patients. Thus, serum galactose-deficient IgA1 levels are highly inherited in pediatric patients with IgAN and HSPN, providing support for another shared pathogenic link between these disorders.",

        "Abstract": "HIV-1-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is a major complication of HIV-1 infection, frequently resulting in kidney failure. HIVAN arises due to HIV-1-induced dysregulation of podocytes, the glomerular epithelial cells that establish and maintain the kidney filtration barrier. Host genetic factors are important for the development of HIVAN. The risk of HIVAN is greatest in populations of African ancestry, and is attributable to a genetic variation at the APOL1 locus on chromosome 22. Mouse models of HIVAN enable delineation of dysregulated pathways underlying disease. Identification of HIVAN susceptibility loci in a mouse model, combined with expression quantitative trait locus mapping, has demonstrated that murine HIVAN loci transregulate podocyte gene expression. HIV-1 induces perturbations in podocyte expression response, suggesting that HIV-1 potentially interferes with compensatory pathways that normally restore cellular homeostasis in the face of genetic mutations. These findings present a framework for identification of podocyte transregulators and reconstruction of the molecular networks connecting susceptibility genes to the development of nephropathy.",

We report a case of outflow failure in which catheterography showed several characteristics of omental wrapping: \"pseudocele\" formation, delayed catheter emptying, and uneven distribution of contrast in the abdominal cavity. A laparoscopic procedure was performed with identification of peritoneal adhesion and greater omental wrapping. The catheter was stripped from the omentum and repositioned in the Douglas peritoneal sac. Catheterography is a reliable, safe, noninvasive, and inexpensive alternative procedure to diagnose outflow failure caused by omental wrapping.",

        "Abstract": "Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide and an important cause of kidney disease in young adults. Highly variable clinical presentation and outcome of IgAN suggest that this diagnosis may encompass multiple subsets of disease that are not distinguishable by currently available clinical tools. Marked differences in disease prevalence between individuals of European, Asian, and African ancestry suggest the existence of susceptibility genes that are present at variable frequencies in these populations. Familial forms of IgAN have also been reported throughout the world but are probably underrecognized because associated urinary abnormalities are often intermittent in affected family members. Of the many pathogenic mechanisms reported, defects in IgA1 glycosylation that lead to formation of immune complexes have been consistently demonstrated. Recent data indicates that these IgA1 glycosylation defects are inherited and constitute a heritable risk factor for IgAN. Because of the complex genetic architecture of IgAN, the efforts to map disease susceptibility genes have been difficult, and no causative mutations have yet been identified. Linkage-based approaches have been hindered by disease heterogeneity and lack of a reliable noninvasive diagnostic test for screening family members at risk of IgAN. Many candidate-gene association studies have been published, but most suffer from small sample size and methodological problems, and none of the results have been convincingly validated. New genomic approaches, including genome-wide association studies currently under way, offer promising tools for elucidating the genetic basis of IgAN.",

        "Abstract": "Multiple studies have linked podocyte gene variants to diverse sporadic nephropathies, including HIV-1-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). We previously used linkage analysis to identify a major HIVAN susceptibility locus in mouse, HIVAN1. We performed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis of podocyte genes in HIV-1 transgenic mice to gain further insight into genetic susceptibility to HIVAN. In 2 independent crosses, we found that transcript levels of the podocyte gene nephrosis 2 homolog (Nphs2), were heritable and controlled by an ancestral cis-eQTL that conferred a 3-fold variation in expression and produced reactive changes in other podocyte genes. In addition, Nphs2 expression was controlled by 2 trans-eQTLs that localized to the nephropathy susceptibility intervals HIVAN1 and HIVAN2. Transregulation of podocyte genes was observed in the absence of HIV-1 or glomerulosclerosis, indicating that nephropathy susceptibility alleles induce latent perturbations in the podocyte expression network. Presence of the HIV-1 transgene interfered with transregulation, demonstrating effects of gene-environment interactions on disease. These data demonstrate that transcript levels of Nphs2 and related podocyte-expressed genes are networked and suggest that the genetic lesions introduced by HIVAN susceptibility alleles perturb this regulatory pathway and transcriptional responses to HIV-1, increasing susceptibility to nephropathy.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, the sequencing of mammalian and microbial genomes has provided the opportunity to study how genetic variation in the host and pathogen influence the course of infectious disease. In the case of HIV-1 infection, such studies have led to identification of key viral proteins that determine pathogenicity, immune evasion, or drug resistance. In addition, candidate gene association studies have uncovered a large number of host genetic variants that influence the outcome of infection and some organ-specific complications. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is a pathologically distinct complication of HIV infection. Interindividual variability in incidence, skewed ethnic distribution, and familial aggregation of HIVAN with other forms of ESRD have suggested genetic susceptibility as a major contributing factor. This article reviews the host genetic factors that influence the course of HIV-1 infection and discusses murine models that have increased the understanding of HIVAN pathogenesis and demonstrated the role of genetic background on determination of disease.",
