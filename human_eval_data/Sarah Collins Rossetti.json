        "Abstract": "Efforts to reduce documentation burden (DocBurden) for all health professionals (HP) are aligned with national initiatives to improve clinician wellness and patient safety. Yet DocBurden has not been precisely defined, limiting national conversations and rigorous, reproducible, and meaningful measures. Increasing attention to DocBurden motivated this work to establish a standard definition of DocBurden, with the emergence of excessive DocBurden as a term.",

This study developed a time series risk model for predicting ED visits and hospitalizations in patients with HF using longitudinal electronic health record data. We also explored which data sources yield the best-performing models over various time windows.",

        "Abstract": "Every year, hundreds of thousands of inpatients die from cardiac arrest and sepsis, which could be avoided if those patients' risk for deterioration were detected and timely interventions were initiated. Thus, a system is needed to convert real-time, raw patient data into consumable information that clinicians can utilize to identify patients at risk of deterioration and thus prevent mortality and improve patient health outcomes. The overarching goal of the COmmunicating Narrative Concerns Entered by Registered Nurses (CONCERN) study is to implement and evaluate an early warning score system that provides clinical decision support (CDS) in electronic health record systems. With a combination of machine learning and natural language processing, the CONCERN CDS utilizes nursing documentation patterns as indicators of nurses' increased surveillance to predict when patients are at the risk of clinical deterioration.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to demonstrate nursing documentation variation based on electronic health record design and its relationship with different levels of care by reviewing how various flowsheet measures, within the same electronic health record across an integrated healthcare system, are documented in different types of medical facilities. Flowsheet data with information on patients who were admitted to academic medical centers, community hospitals, and rehabilitation centers were used to calculate the frequency of flowsheet entries documented. We then compared the distinct flowsheet measures documented in five flowsheet templates across the different facilities. We observed that each type of healthcare facility appeared to have distinct clinical care foci and flowsheet measures documented differed within the same template based on facility type. Designing flowsheets tailored to study settings can meet the needs of end users and increase documentation efficiency by reducing time spent on unrelated flowsheet measures. Furthermore, this process can save nurses time for direct patient care.",

        "Abstract": "It is clear that interdisciplinary communication and collaboration have the potential to mitigate healthcare-associated harm, yet there is limited research on how communication through documentation in the patient record can support collaborative decision making. Understanding what information is needed to support collaborative decision making is necessary to design electronic health information systems that facilitate effective communication and, ultimately, safe care. To explore this issue, we focused on information needs related to central venous catheter management and the prevention of central line-associated blood stream infections. Semistructured interviews were conducted with nurses working in an intensive care unit. Interview transcripts were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Three themes were identified: (1) challenges managing documentation in multiple places in the absence of formal documentation processes for central venous catheter management; (2) lack of standardized decision-making processes for managing central venous catheters; and (3) oral communication holds it together. Our findings provide a foundation for the development of EHR functional requirements that enhance communication regarding the management of central venous catheters and facilitate the prompt removal of unnecessary lines.",

Information models (IMs) are created to standardize data elements into a logical organization that includes data elements, definitions, data types, values, and relationships. To be generalizable, these models need to be validated across organizations. The purpose of this case report is to describe a refined methodology for validation of flowsheet IMs and apply the revised process to a genitourinary IM created in one organization. The refined IM process, adding evidence and input from experts, produced a clinically relevant and evidence-based model of genitourinary care. The refined IM process provides a foundation for optimizing electronic health records with comparable nurse sensitive data that can add to common data models for continuity of care and ongoing use for quality improvement and research.",

        "Abstract": "Documentation burden has become an increasing concern as the prevalence of electronic health records (EHRs) has grown. The implementation of a new EHR is an opportunity to measure and improve documentation burden, as well as assess the role of the EHR in clinician workflow. Time-motion observation is the preferred method for evaluating workflow. In this study, we developed and tested the reliability of an interprofessional taxonomy for use in time-motion observation of nursing and physician workflow before and after a new EHR is implemented at a large academic medical center. Inter-observer reliability assessment sessions were conducted while observing both nurses and physicians. Four out of five observers achieved reliability in an average of 5.75 sessions. Our developed taxonomy demonstrated to be reliable for conducting workflow evaluation of both nurses and physicians, with a focus on time and tasks in the EHR.",

        "Abstract": "Identifying patients at risk of deterioration in the hospital and intervening more quickly to prevent adverse events is a top patient safety priority. Early warning scores (EWS) identify at risk patients, but there is much opportunity for improvement particularly related to increasing lead time - the time from an alert trigger to adverse event (e.g., cardiac arrest, death). Our team develops healthcare process models of clinical concern (HPM-CC) and in this work has identified documentation signals that are proxies of nurses concern and can be used to predict patient risk earlier than current EWS systems that rely only on physiological data. We compared the performance of a validated EWS - the MEWS - to our novel model (MEWS-CC) comprised of MEWS criteria plus 3 proxy variables of nursing concern. MEWS-CC performed similarly to MEWS, with the added benefit of increased the time from EWS trigger to event by 5-26 hours.",

        "Abstract": "Real time data provided by frontline clinicians could be used to direct immediate resources during a public health emergency and inform increased preparedness for future events. The United States Critical Illness and Injury Trials Group Program for Emergency Preparedness (USCIIT-PREP), a group of expert critical care and emergency medicine physicians at various academic medical centers across the US, aims to enhance the national capability of rapid electronic data collection, along with analysis and dissemination of findings. To achieve these aims, USCIIT-PREP created a process for real-time data capture that relies on a curated and engaged network of clinical providers from various geographical regions to respond to short online \"Pulse\" queries about healthcare system stress. During a period of three years, five queries were created and distributed. The first two queries were used to develop and validate the data collection infrastructure. Results are reported for the last three queries between June 2015 and March 2016. Response rates consistently ranged from 39% to 42%. Our team demonstrated that our system and processes were ready for creation and rapid dissemination of episodic queries for rapid data collection, transmittal, and analysis through a curated national network of clinician responders during a public health emergency. USCIIT-PREP aims to further increase the response rate through additional engagement efforts within the network, to continue to grow the clinician responder database, and to optimize additional query content.",
