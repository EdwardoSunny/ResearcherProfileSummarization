        "Abstract": "Although rare diseases individually have a low prevalence, they collectively affect nearly 400 million individuals around the world. On average, it takes five years for an accurate rare disease diagnosis, but many patients remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. As machine learning technologies have been used to aid diagnostics in the past, this study aims to test ChatGPT's suitability for rare disease diagnostic support with the enhancement provided by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RareDxGPT, our enhanced ChatGPT model, supplies ChatGPT with information about 717 rare diseases from an external knowledge resource, the RareDis Corpus, through RAG. In RareDxGPT, when a query is entered, the three documents most relevant to the query in the RareDis Corpus are retrieved. Along with the query, they are returned to ChatGPT to provide a diagnosis. Additionally, phenotypes for thirty different diseases were extracted from free text from PubMed's Case Reports. They were each entered with three different prompt types: \"prompt\", \"prompt\u00a0+\u00a0explanation\" and \"prompt\u00a0+\u00a0role play.\" The accuracy of ChatGPT and RareDxGPT with each prompt was then measured. With \"Prompt\", RareDxGPT had a 40\u00a0% accuracy, while ChatGPT 3.5 got 37\u00a0% of the cases correct. With \"Prompt\u00a0+\u00a0Explanation\", RareDxGPT had a 43\u00a0% accuracy, while ChatGPT 3.5 got 23\u00a0% of the cases correct. With \"Prompt\u00a0+\u00a0Role Play\", RareDxGPT had a 40\u00a0% accuracy, while ChatGPT 3.5 got 23\u00a0% of the cases correct. To conclude, ChatGPT, especially when supplying extra domain specific knowledge, demonstrates early potential for rare disease diagnosis with adjustments.",

        "Title": "Artificial intelligence for nonmelanoma skin cancer.",
        "Abstract": "Nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) are among the top five most common cancers globally. NMSC is an area with great potential for novel application of diagnostic tools including artificial intelligence (AI). In this scoping review, we aimed to describe the applications of AI in the diagnosis and treatment of NMSC. Twenty-nine publications described AI applications to dermatopathology including lesion classification and margin assessment. Twenty-five publications discussed AI use in clinical image analysis, showing that algorithms are not superior to dermatologists and may rely on unbalanced, nonrepresentative, and nontransparent training data sets. Sixteen publications described the use of AI in cutaneous surgery for NMSC including use in margin assessment during excisions and Mohs surgery, as well as predicting procedural complexity. Eleven publications discussed spectroscopy, confocal microscopy, thermography, and the AI algorithms that analyze and interpret their data. Ten publications pertained to AI applications for the discovery and use of NMSC biomarkers. Eight publications discussed the use of smartphones and AI, specifically how they enable clinicians and patients to have increased access to instant dermatologic assessments but with varying accuracies. Five publications discussed large language models and NMSC, including how they may facilitate or hinder patient education and medical decision-making. Three publications pertaining to the skin of color and AI for NMSC discussed concerns regarding limited diverse data sets for the training of convolutional neural networks. AI demonstrates tremendous potential to improve diagnosis, patient and clinician education, and management of NMSC. Despite excitement regarding AI, data sets are often not transparently reported, may include low-quality images, and may not include diverse skin types, limiting generalizability. AI may serve as a tool to increase access to dermatology services for patients in rural areas and save health care dollars. These benefits can only be achieved, however, with consideration of potential ethical costs.",

This study investigates whether concept annotation tools such as MetaMap can enable topic modeling at the semantic level. Using tweets mentioning \"hydroxychloroquine\" for a case study, we extracted 56,017 posted between 03/01/2020-12/31/2021. The tweets were run through MetaMap to encode concepts with UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) and then we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the optimal model for two datasets: 1) tweets with the original text and 2) tweets with the replaced CUIs. We found that the MetaMap LDA models outperformed the non-MetaMap models in terms of coherence and representativeness and identified topics timely relevant to social and political discussions. We concluded that integrating MetaMap to standardize tweets through UMLS concepts improved semantic topic modeling performance amidst noise in the text.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical notes are full of ambiguous medical abbreviations. Contextual knowledge has been leveraged by recent learning-based approaches for sense disambiguation. Previous findings indicated that structural elements of clinical notes entail useful characteristics for informing different interpretations of abbreviations, yet they have remained underutilized and have not been fully investigated. To our best knowledge, the only study exploring note structures simply enumerated the headers in the notes, where such representations are not semantically meaningful. This paper describes a learning-based approach using the note structure represented by the semantic types predefined in Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). We evaluated the representation in addition to the widely used N-gram with three learning models on two different datasets. Experiments indicate that our feature augmentation consistently improved model performance for abbreviation disambiguation, with the optimal F1 score of 0.93.",

        "Abstract": "Skin cancer mortality rates continue to rise, and survival analysis is increasingly needed to understand who is at risk and what interventions improve outcomes. However, current statistical methods are limited by inability to synthesize multiple data types, such as patient genetics, clinical history, demographics, and pathology and reveal significant multimodal relationships through predictive algorithms. Advances in computing power and data science enabled the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), which synthesizes vast amounts of data and applies algorithms that enable personalized diagnostic approaches. Here, we analyze AI methods used in skin cancer survival analysis, focusing on supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. We illustrate strengths and weaknesses of these approaches with examples. Our PubMed search yielded 14 publications meeting inclusion criteria for this scoping review. Most publications focused on melanoma, particularly histopathologic interpretation with deep learning. Such concentration on a single type of skin cancer amid increasing focus on deep learning highlight growing areas for innovation; however, it also demonstrates opportunity for additional analysis that addresses other types of cutaneous malignancies and expands the scope of prognostication to combine both genetic, histopathologic, and clinical data. Moreover, researchers may leverage multiple AI methods for enhanced benefit in analyses. Expanding AI to this arena may enable improved survival analysis, targeted treatments, and outcomes.",

        "Title": "GestaltMML: Enhancing Rare Genetic Disease Diagnosis through Multimodal Machine Learning Combining Facial Images and Clinical Texts.",
        "Abstract": "Individuals with suspected rare genetic disorders often undergo multiple clinical evaluations, imaging studies, laboratory tests and genetic tests, to find a possible answer over a prolonged period of time. Addressing this \"diagnostic odyssey\" thus has substantial clinical, psychosocial, and economic benefits. Many rare genetic diseases have distinctive facial features, which can be used by artificial intelligence algorithms to facilitate clinical diagnosis, in prioritizing candidate diseases to be further examined by lab tests or genetic assays, or in helping the phenotype-driven reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data. Existing methods using frontal facial photos were built on conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), rely exclusively on facial images, and cannot capture non-facial phenotypic traits and demographic information essential for guiding accurate diagnoses. Here we introduce GestaltMML, a multimodal machine learning (MML) approach solely based on the Transformer architecture. It integrates facial images, demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity), and clinical notes (optionally, a list of Human Phenotype Ontology terms) to improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we also evaluated GestaltMML on a diverse range of datasets, including 528 diseases from the GestaltMatcher Database, several in-house datasets of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS, over-growth syndrome with distinct facial features), Sotos syndrome (overgrowth syndrome with overlapping features with BWS), NAA10-related neurodevelopmental syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome), and KBG syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome). Our results suggest that GestaltMML effectively incorporates multiple modalities of data, greatly narrowing candidate genetic diagnoses of rare diseases and may facilitate the reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data.",

        "Title": "Assessing the Utility of Large Language Models for Phenotype-Driven Gene Prioritization in Rare Genetic Disorder Diagnosis.",
        "Abstract": "Phenotype-driven gene prioritization is a critical process in the diagnosis of rare genetic disorders for identifying and ranking potential disease-causing genes based on observed physical traits or phenotypes. While traditional approaches rely on curated knowledge graphs with phenotype-gene relations, recent advancements in large language models have opened doors to the potential of AI predictions through extensive training on diverse corpora and complex models. This study conducted a comprehensive evaluation of five large language models, including two Generative Pre-trained Transformers series, and three Llama2 series, assessing their performance across three key metrics: task completeness, gene prediction accuracy, and adherence to required output structures. Various experiments explored combinations of models, prompts, input types, and task difficulty levels. Our findings reveal that even the best-performing LLM, GPT-4, achieved an accuracy of 16.0%, which still lags behind traditional bioinformatics tools. Prediction accuracy increased with the parameter/model size. A similar increasing trend was observed for the task completion rate, with complicated prompts more likely to increase task completeness in models smaller than GPT-4. However, complicated prompts are more likely to decrease the structure compliance rate, but no prompt effects on GPT-4. Compared to HPO term-based input, LLM was also able to achieve better than random prediction accuracy by taking free-text input, but slightly lower than with the HPO input. Bias analysis showed that certain genes, such as MECP2, CDKL5, and SCN1A, are more likely to be top-ranked, potentially explaining the variances observed across different datasets. This study provides valuable insights into the integration of LLMs within genomic analysis, contributing to the ongoing discussion on the utilization of advanced LLMs in clinical workflows.",

        "Abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by an unpredictable course of flares and remission with diverse manifestations. Lupus nephritis, one of the major disease manifestations of SLE for organ damage and mortality, is a key component of lupus classification criteria. Accurately identifying lupus nephritis in electronic health records (EHRs) would therefore benefit large cohort observational studies and clinical trials where characterization of the patient population is critical for recruitment, study design, and analysis. Lupus nephritis can be recognized through procedure codes and structured data, such as laboratory tests. However, other critical information documenting lupus nephritis, such as histologic reports from kidney biopsies and prior medical history narratives, require sophisticated text processing to mine information from pathology reports and clinical notes. In this study, we developed algorithms to identify lupus nephritis with and without natural language processing (NLP) using EHR data from the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW).",

        "Abstract": "Research on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for common, genetically complex chronic diseases aims to improve health-related predictions, tailor risk-reducing interventions, and improve health outcomes. Yet, the study and use of PRSs in clinical settings raise equity, clinical, and regulatory challenges that can be greater for individuals from historically marginalized racial, ethnic, and other minoritized communities. As part of the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics IV Network, we conducted online focus groups with patients/community members, clinicians, and members of institutional review boards to explore their views on key issues, including PRS research, return of PRS results, clinical translation, and barriers and facilitators to health behavioral changes in response to PRS results. Across stakeholder groups, our findings indicate support for PRS development and a strong interest in having PRS results returned to research participants. However, we also found multi-level barriers and significant differences in stakeholders' views about what is needed and possible for successful implementation. These include researcher-participant interaction formats, health and genomic literacy, and a range of structural barriers, such as financial instability, insurance coverage, and the absence of health-supporting infrastructure and affordable healthy food options in poorer neighborhoods. Our findings highlight the need to revisit and implement measures in PRS studies (e.g., incentives and resources for follow-up care), as well as system-level policies to promote equity in genomic research and health outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have improved in predictive performance, but several challenges remain to be addressed before PRSs can be implemented in the clinic, including reduced predictive performance of PRSs in diverse populations, and the interpretation and communication of genetic results to both providers and patients. To address these challenges, the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network has developed a framework and pipeline for return of a PRS-based genome-informed risk assessment to 25,000 diverse adults and children as part of a clinical study. From an initial list of 23 conditions, ten were selected for implementation based on PRS performance, medical actionability and potential clinical utility, including cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. Standardized metrics were considered in the selection process, with additional consideration given to strength of evidence in African and Hispanic populations. We then developed a pipeline for clinical PRS implementation (score transfer to a clinical laboratory, validation and verification of score performance), and used genetic ancestry to calibrate PRS mean and variance, utilizing genetically diverse data from 13,475 participants of the All of Us Research Program cohort to train and test model parameters. Finally, we created a framework for regulatory compliance and developed a PRS clinical report for return to providers and for inclusion in an additional genome-informed risk assessment. The initial experience from eMERGE can inform the approach needed to implement PRS-based testing in diverse clinical settings.",

        "Abstract": "The field of dermatology is experiencing the rapid deployment of artificial intelligence (AI), from mobile applications (apps) for skin cancer detection to large language models like ChatGPT that can answer generalist or specialist questions about skin diagnoses. With these new applications, ethical concerns have emerged. In this scoping review, we aimed to identify the applications of AI to the field of dermatology and to understand their ethical implications. We used a multifaceted search approach, searching PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar for primary literature, following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews guidance. Our advanced query included terms related to dermatology, AI and ethical considerations. Our search yielded 202 papers. After initial screening, 68 studies were included. Thirty-two were related to clinical image analysis and raised ethical concerns for misdiagnosis, data security, privacy violations and replacement of dermatologist jobs. Seventeen discussed limited skin of colour representation in datasets leading to potential misdiagnosis in the general population. Nine articles about teledermatology raised ethical concerns, including the exacerbation of health disparities, lack of standardized regulations, informed consent for AI use and privacy challenges. Seven addressed inaccuracies in the responses of large language models. Seven examined attitudes toward and trust in AI, with most patients requesting supplemental assessment by a physician to ensure reliability and accountability. Benefits of AI integration into clinical practice include increased patient access, improved clinical decision-making, efficiency and many others. However, safeguards must be put in place to ensure the ethical application of AI.",

        "Abstract": "To enhance phenotype recognition in clinical notes of genetic diseases, we developed two models-PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT-for expanding the vocabularies of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. While HPO offers a standardized vocabulary for phenotypes, existing tools often fail to capture the full scope of phenotypes due to limitations from traditional heuristic or rule-based approaches. Our models leverage large language models to automate the detection of phenotype terms, including those not in the current HPO. We compare these models with PhenoTagger, another HPO recognition tool, and found that our models identify a wider range of phenotype concepts, including previously uncharacterized ones. Our models also show strong performance in case studies on biomedical literature. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of BERT- and GPT-based models in aspects such as architecture and accuracy. Overall, our models enhance automated phenotype detection from clinical texts, improving downstream analyses on human diseases.",

        "Title": "Polygenic risk alters the penetrance of monogenic kidney disease.",
        "Abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined by an interplay of monogenic, polygenic, and environmental risks. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and COL4A-associated nephropathy (COL4A-AN) represent the most common forms of monogenic kidney diseases. These disorders have incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, and we hypothesize that polygenic factors explain some of this variability. By combining SNP array, exome/genome sequence, and electronic health record data from the UK Biobank and All-of-Us cohorts, we demonstrate that the genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) significantly predicts CKD among ADPKD monogenic variant carriers. Compared to the middle tertile of the GPS for noncarriers, ADPKD variant carriers in the top tertile have a 54-fold increased risk of CKD, while ADPKD variant carriers in the bottom tertile have only a 3-fold increased risk of CKD. Similarly, the GPS significantly predicts CKD in COL4A-AN carriers. The carriers in the top tertile of the GPS have a 2.5-fold higher risk of CKD, while the risk for carriers in the bottom tertile is not different from the average population risk. These results suggest that accounting for polygenic risk improves risk stratification in monogenic kidney disease.",

        "Abstract": "Rare disease patients often endure prolonged diagnostic odysseys and may still remain undiagnosed for years. Selecting the appropriate genetic tests is crucial to lead to timely diagnosis. Phenotypic features offer great potential for aiding genomic diagnosis in rare disease cases. We see great promise in effective integration of phenotypic information into genetic test selection workflow. In this study, we present a phenotype-driven molecular genetic test recommendation (Phen2Test) for pediatric rare disease diagnosis. Phen2Test was constructed using frequency matrix of phecodes and demographic data from the EHR before ordering genetic tests, with the objective to streamline the selection of molecular genetic tests (whole-exome / whole-genome sequencing, or gene panels) for clinicians with minimum genetic training expertise. We developed and evaluated binary classifiers based on 1,005 individuals referred to genetic counselors for potential genetic evaluation. In the evaluation using the gold standard cohort, the model achieved strong performance with an AUROC of 0.82 and an AUPRC of 0.92. Furthermore, we tested the model on another silver standard cohort (n=6,458), achieving an overall AUROC of 0.72 and an AUPRC of 0.671. Phen2Test was adjusted to align with current clinical guidelines, showing superior performance with more recent data, demonstrating its potential for use within a learning healthcare system as a genomic medicine intervention that adapts to guideline updates. This study showcases the practical utility of phenotypic features in recommending molecular genetic tests with performance comparable to clinical geneticists. Phen2Test could assist clinicians with limited genetic training and knowledge to order appropriate genetic tests.",

        "Abstract": "African Americans have a significantly higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease, especially focal segmental glomerulosclerosis -, than European Americans. Two coding variants (G1 and G2) in the APOL1 gene play a major role in this disparity. While 13% of African Americans carry the high-risk recessive genotypes, only a fraction of these individuals develops FSGS or kidney failure, indicating the involvement of additional disease modifiers. Here, we show that the presence of the APOL1 p.N264K missense variant, when co-inherited with the G2 APOL1 risk allele, substantially reduces the penetrance of the G1G2 and G2G2 high-risk genotypes by rendering these genotypes low-risk. These results align with prior functional evidence showing that the p.N264K variant reduces the toxicity of the APOL1 high-risk alleles. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of APOL1-associated nephropathy, as well as for the clinical management of individuals with high-risk genotypes that include the G2 allele.",

Similar presentation to benign conditions, significant genetic variation, and lack of definitive biomarkers contributes to diagnostic delay. The etiology of CTCL is unknown, and environmental exposures, such as geographic, occupational, chemicals, sunlight, and insects have been investigated.",

        "Abstract": "To enhance phenotype recognition in clinical notes of genetic diseases, we developed two models - PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT - for expanding the vocabularies of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. While HPO offers a standardized vocabulary for phenotypes, existing tools often fail to capture the full scope of phenotypes, due to limitations from traditional heuristic or rule-based approaches. Our models leverage large language models (LLMs) to automate the detection of phenotype terms, including those not in the current HPO. We compared these models to PhenoTagger, another HPO recognition tool, and found that our models identify a wider range of phenotype concepts, including previously uncharacterized ones. Our models also showed strong performance in case studies on biomedical literature. We evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of BERT-based and GPT-based models in aspects such as architecture and accuracy. Overall, our models enhance automated phenotype detection from clinical texts, improving downstream analyses on human diseases.",

There remain many opportunities in dermatology to further use biobank data to increase our knowledge about the genetic architecture of skin disease, to resolve disease mechanisms that can be modulated by medical interventions and to discover genetically derived disease relationships that inform on drug repurposing and adverse events.

        "Abstract": "As large-scale genomic screening becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding the influence of actionable results on healthcare utilization is key to estimating the potential long-term clinical impact. The eMERGE network sequenced individuals for actionable genes in multiple genetic conditions and returned results to individuals, providers, and the electronic health record. Differences in recommended health services (laboratory, imaging, and procedural testing) delivered within 12\u00a0months of return were compared among individuals with pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) findings to matched individuals with negative findings before and after return of results. Of 16,218 adults, 477 unselected individuals were found to have a monogenic risk for arrhythmia (n\u00a0= 95), breast cancer (n\u00a0= 96), cardiomyopathy (n\u00a0= 95), colorectal cancer (n\u00a0= 105), or familial hypercholesterolemia (n\u00a0= 86). Individuals with P/LP results more frequently received services after return (43.8%) compared to before return (25.6%) of results and compared to individuals with negative findings (24.9%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The annual cost of qualifying healthcare services increased from an average of $162 before return to $343 after return of results among the P/LP group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001); differences in the negative group were non-significant. The mean difference-in-differences was $149 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), which describes the increased cost within the P/LP group corrected for cost changes in the negative group. When stratified by individual conditions, significant cost differences were observed for arrhythmia, breast cancer, and cardiomyopathy. In conclusion, less than half of individuals received billed health services after monogenic return, which modestly increased healthcare costs for payors in the year following return.",

        "Abstract": "Opportunities to improve the clinical management of skin disease are being created by advances in genomic medicine. Large-scale sequencing increasingly challenges notions about single-gene disorders. It is now apparent that monogenic etiologies make appreciable contributions to the population burden of disease and that they are underrecognized in clinical practice. A genetic diagnosis informs on molecular pathology and may direct targeted treatments and tailored prevention strategies for patients and family members. It also generates knowledge about disease pathogenesis and management that is relevant to patients without rare pathogenic variants. Inborn errors of immunity are a large class of monogenic etiologies that have been well-studied and contribute to the population burden of inflammatory diseases. To further delineate the contributions of inborn errors of immunity to the pathogenesis of skin disease, we performed a set of analyses that identified 316 inborn errors of immunity associated with skin pathologies, including common skin diseases. These data suggest that clinical sequencing is underutilized in dermatology. We next use these data to derive a network that illuminates the molecular relationships of these disorders and suggests an underlying etiological organization to immune-mediated skin disease. Our results motivate the further development of a molecularly derived and data-driven reorganization of clinical diagnoses of skin disease.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable successes in zero- and few-shot performance on various downstream tasks, paving the way for applications in high-stakes domains. In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT, in performing zero-shot medical evidence summarization across six clinical domains. We conduct both automatic and human evaluations, covering several dimensions of summary quality. Our study demonstrates that automatic metrics often do not strongly correlate with the quality of summaries. Furthermore, informed by our human evaluations, we define a terminology of error types for medical evidence summarization. Our findings reveal that LLMs could be susceptible to generating factually inconsistent summaries and making overly convincing or uncertain statements, leading to potential harm due to misinformation. Moreover, we find that models struggle to identify the salient information and are more error-prone when summarizing over longer textual contexts.",

Despite progress in automated extraction of PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) entities from PubMed, rarely are these entities encoded by standard terminology to achieve semantic interoperability. This study aims to evaluate the suitability of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and SNOMED-CT in encoding outcome concepts in randomized controlled trial (RCT) abstracts.",

        "Abstract": "Participant recruitment continues to be a challenge to the success of randomized controlled trials, resulting in increased costs, extended trial timelines and delayed treatment availability. Literature provides evidence that study design features (e.g., trial phase, study site involvement) and trial sponsor are significantly associated with recruitment success. Principal investigators oversee the conduct of clinical trials, including recruitment. Through a cross-sectional survey and a thematic analysis of free-text responses, we assessed the perceptions of sixteen principal investigators regarding success factors for participant recruitment. Study site involvement and funding source do not necessarily make recruitment easier or more challenging from the perspective of the principal investigators. The most commonly used recruitment strategies are also the most effort inefficient (e.g., in-person recruitment, reviewing the electronic medical records for prescreening). Finally, we recommended actionable steps, such as improving staff support and leveraging informatics-driven approaches, to allow clinical researchers to enhance participant recruitment.",

        "Abstract": "Real-world clinical practice commonly veers from formal drug approvals in off-label use, accounting for 21% of prescriptions for common drugs. Due to its ad hoc nature, off-label use typically goes undocumented, evading the safety and efficacy scrutiny of clinical trials. A systematic and automated approach to detection of these uses in the electronic health record (EHR) would enable improved safety monitoring, provide insight into prescribing patterns, and support real-world evidence appraisal. Domain knowledge provided by medication-indication knowledge bases has been shown to improve the accuracy of EHR-based automated detection of off-label use, but remains limited due to diverse concept representations and granularities across data sources. We present a method to leverage hierarchical concept knowledge to align medication-indication knowledge with EHR data for automated detection of off-label drug use in clinical practice. We demonstrate an over two-fold increase in detected off-label diagnoses when leveraging hierarchical knowledge relative to direct concept matching alone.",

Reduced predictive performance of PRS in diverse populations can exacerbate existing health disparities. The NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network is returning a PRS-based genome-informed risk assessment to 25,000 diverse adults and children. We assessed PRS performance, medical actionability, and potential clinical utility for 23 conditions. Standardized metrics were considered in the selection process with additional consideration given to strength of evidence in African and Hispanic populations. Ten conditions were selected with a range of high-risk thresholds: atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, prostate cancer, asthma, type 1 diabetes, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. We developed a pipeline for clinical PRS implementation, used genetic ancestry to calibrate PRS mean and variance, created a framework for regulatory compliance, and developed a PRS clinical report. eMERGE's experience informs the infrastructure needed to implement PRS-based implementation in diverse clinical settings.",

        "Abstract": "With its seeming competence to mimic human responses, ChatGPT, an emerging AI-powered chatbot, has spurred great interest. This study aims to explore the role of ChatGPT in synthesizing medication literature and compare it with a hybrid summarization system. We tested ten medications' effectiveness with reference to their definitions and descriptions extracted from DrugBank. ChatGPT could generate coherent summaries that are not backed by evidence. In contrast, our approach can provide a highly structured and concise synthesis of related evidence, but the resulting summary is not as fluent and convincing as ChatGPT. Therefore, we recommend integrating both techniques to achieve the best performance.",

        "Abstract": "With the burgeoning development of computational phenotypes, it is increasingly difficult to identify the right phenotype for the right tasks. This study uses a mixed-methods approach to develop and evaluate a novel metadata framework for retrieval of and reusing computational phenotypes. Twenty active phenotyping researchers from 2 large research networks, Electronic Medical Records and Genomics and Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, were recruited to suggest metadata elements. Once consensus was reached on 39 metadata elements, 47 new researchers were surveyed to evaluate the utility of the metadata framework. The survey consisted of 5-Likert multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. Two more researchers were asked to use the metadata framework to annotate 8 type-2 diabetes mellitus phenotypes. More than 90% of the survey respondents rated metadata elements regarding phenotype definition and validation methods and metrics positively with a score of 4 or 5. Both researchers completed annotation of each phenotype within 60\u2009min. Our thematic analysis of the narrative feedback indicates that the metadata framework was effective in capturing rich and explicit descriptions and enabling the search for phenotypes, compliance with data standards, and comprehensive validation metrics. Current limitations were its complexity for data collection and the entailed human costs.",

In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT, in performing zero-shot medical evidence summarization across six clinical domains. We conduct both automatic and human evaluations, covering several dimensions of summary quality. Our study has demonstrated that automatic metrics often do not strongly correlate with the quality of summaries. Furthermore, informed by our human evaluations, we define a terminology of error types for medical evidence summarization. Our findings reveal that LLMs could be susceptible to generating factually inconsistent summaries and making overly convincing or uncertain statements, leading to potential harm due to misinformation. Moreover, we find that models struggle to identify the salient information and are more error-prone when summarizing over longer textual contexts.",

        "Abstract": "Leveraging linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns as representative of population substructure enables the discovery of additive association signals in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Standard GWASs are well-powered to interrogate additive models; however, new approaches are required for invesigating other modes of inheritance such as dominance and epistasis. Epistasis, or non-additive interaction between genes, exists across the genome but often goes undetected because of a lack of statistical power. Furthermore, the adoption of LD pruning as customary in standard GWASs excludes detection of sites that are in LD but might underlie the genetic architecture of complex traits. We hypothesize that uncovering long-range interactions between loci with strong LD due to epistatic selection can elucidate genetic mechanisms underlying common diseases. To investigate this hypothesis, we tested for associations between 23 common diseases and 5,625,845 epistatic SNP-SNP pairs (determined by Ohta's D statistics) in long-range LD (>0.25 cM). Across five disease phenotypes, we identified one significant and four near-significant associations that replicated in two large genotype-phenotype datasets (UK Biobank and eMERGE). The genes that were most likely involved in the replicated associations were (1) members of highly conserved gene families with complex roles in multiple pathways, (2) essential genes, and/or (3) genes that were associated in the literature with complex traits that display variable expressivity. These results support the highly pleiotropic and conserved nature of variants in long-range LD under epistatic selection. Our work supports the hypothesis that epistatic interactions regulate diverse clinical mechanisms and might especially be driving factors in conditions with a wide range of phenotypic outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Background Cardiometabolic diseases are highly comorbid, but their relationship with female-specific or overwhelmingly female-predominant health conditions (breast cancer, endometriosis, pregnancy complications) is understudied. This study aimed to estimate the cross-trait genetic overlap and influence of genetic burden of cardiometabolic traits on health conditions unique to women. Methods and Results Using electronic health record data from 71\u2009008 ancestrally diverse women, we examined relationships between 23 obstetrical/gynecological conditions and 4 cardiometabolic phenotypes (body mass index, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension) by performing 4 analyses: (1) cross-trait genetic correlation analyses to compare genetic architecture, (2) polygenic risk score-based association tests to characterize shared genetic effects on disease risk, (3) Mendelian randomization for significant associations to assess cross-trait causal relationships, and (4) chronology analyses to visualize the timeline of events unique to groups of women with high and low genetic burden for cardiometabolic traits and highlight the disease prevalence in risk groups by age. We observed 27 significant associations between cardiometabolic polygenic scores and obstetrical/gynecological conditions (body mass index and endometrial cancer, body mass index and polycystic ovarian syndrome, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovarian syndrome). Mendelian randomization analysis provided additional evidence of independent causal effects. We also identified an inverse association between coronary artery disease and breast cancer. High cardiometabolic polygenic scores were associated with early development of polycystic ovarian syndrome and gestational hypertension. Conclusions We conclude that polygenic susceptibility to cardiometabolic traits is associated with elevated risk of certain female-specific health conditions.",

        "Abstract": "The electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network assessed the feasibility of deploying portable phenotype rule-based algorithms with natural language processing (NLP) components added to improve performance of existing algorithms using electronic health records (EHRs). Based on scientific merit and predicted difficulty, eMERGE selected six existing phenotypes to enhance with NLP. We assessed performance, portability, and ease of use. We summarized lessons learned by: (1) challenges; (2) best practices to address challenges based on existing evidence and/or eMERGE experience; and (3) opportunities for future research. Adding NLP resulted in improved, or the same, precision and/or recall for all but one algorithm. Portability, phenotyping workflow/process, and technology were major themes. With NLP, development and validation took longer. Besides portability of NLP technology and algorithm replicability, factors to ensure success include privacy protection, technical infrastructure setup, intellectual property agreement, and efficient communication. Workflow improvements can improve communication and reduce implementation time. NLP performance varied mainly due to clinical document heterogeneity; therefore, we suggest using semi-structured notes, comprehensive documentation, and customization options. NLP portability is possible with improved phenotype algorithm performance, but careful planning and architecture of the algorithms is essential to support local customizations.",

One strategy to improve recruitment is to conduct eligibility prescreening, a resource-intensive process where clinical research staff manually reviews electronic health records data to identify potentially eligible patients.

We performed a genome-wide association study of serum IgA levels in 41,263 individuals of diverse ancestries and identified 20 genome-wide significant loci, including 9 known and 11 novel loci. Co-localization analyses with expression QTLs prioritized candidate genes for 14 of 20 significant loci. Most loci encoded genes that produced immune defects and IgA abnormalities when genetically manipulated in mice. We also observed positive genetic correlations of serum IgA levels with IgA nephropathy, type 2 diabetes, and body mass index, and negative correlations with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and several infections. Mendelian randomization supported elevated serum IgA as a causal factor in IgA nephropathy. African ancestry was consistently associated with higher serum IgA levels and greater frequency of IgA-increasing alleles compared to other ancestries. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of IgA levels and its potential role in human disease.",

This study extends those results across the lifespan, with genomic disorders enriched in both pediatric and adult patients compared with controls. In the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study, genomic disorders were also associated with lower serum Mg, lower educational performance, and a higher risk of death. A phenome-wide association study confirmed the link between kidney disease and genomic disorders in an unbiased way. Systematic detection of genomic disorders can provide a molecular diagnosis and refine prediction of risk and prognosis.",

        "Abstract": "Although individually rare, collectively more than 7,000 rare diseases affect about 10% of patients. Each of the rare diseases impacts the quality of life for patients and their families, and incurs significant societal costs. The low prevalence of each rare disease causes formidable challenges in accurately diagnosing and caring for these patients and engaging participants in research to advance treatments. Deep learning has advanced many scientific fields and has been applied to many healthcare tasks. This study reviewed the current uses of deep learning to advance rare disease research. Among the 332 reviewed articles, we found that deep learning has been actively used for rare neoplastic diseases (250/332), followed by rare genetic diseases (170/332) and rare neurological diseases (127/332). Convolutional neural networks (307/332) were the most frequently used deep learning architecture, presumably because image data were the most commonly available data type in rare disease research. Diagnosis is the main focus of rare disease research using deep learning (263/332). We summarized the challenges and future research directions for leveraging deep learning to advance rare disease research.",

        "Title": "Biolink Model: A universal schema for knowledge graphs in clinical, biomedical, and translational science.",
        "Abstract": "Within clinical, biomedical, and translational science, an increasing number of projects are adopting graphs for knowledge representation. Graph-based data models elucidate the interconnectedness among core biomedical concepts, enable data structures to be easily updated, and support intuitive queries, visualizations, and inference algorithms. However, knowledge discovery across these \"knowledge graphs\" (KGs) has remained difficult. Data set heterogeneity and complexity; the proliferation of ad hoc data formats; poor compliance with guidelines on findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability; and, in particular, the lack of a universally accepted, open-access model for standardization across biomedical KGs has left the task of reconciling data sources to downstream consumers. Biolink Model is an open-source data model that can be used to formalize the relationships between data structures in translational science. It incorporates object-oriented classification and graph-oriented features. The core of the model is a set of hierarchical, interconnected classes (or categories) and relationships between them (or predicates) representing biomedical entities such as gene, disease, chemical, anatomic structure, and phenotype. The model provides class and edge attributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one another. Here, we highlight the need for a standardized data model for KGs, describe Biolink Model, and compare it with other models. We demonstrate the utility of Biolink Model in various initiatives, including the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium and the Monarch Initiative, and show how it has supported easier integration and interoperability of biomedical KGs, bringing together knowledge from multiple sources and helping to realize the goals of translational science.",

        "Abstract": "Diagnosis for rare genetic diseases often relies on phenotype-driven methods, which hinge on the accuracy and completeness of the rare disease phenotypes in the underlying annotation knowledgebase. Existing knowledgebases are often manually curated with additional annotations found in published case reports. Despite their potential, real-world data such as electronic health records (EHRs) have not been fully exploited to derive rare disease annotations. Here, we present open annotation for rare diseases (OARD), a real-world-data-derived resource with annotation for rare-disease-related phenotypes. This resource is derived from the EHRs of two academic health institutions containing more than 10 million individuals spanning wide age ranges and different disease subgroups. By leveraging ontology mapping and advanced natural-language-processing (NLP) methods, OARD automatically and efficiently extracts concepts for both rare diseases and their phenotypic traits from billing codes and lab tests as well as over 100 million clinical narratives. The rare disease prevalence derived by OARD is highly correlated with those annotated in the original rare disease knowledgebase. By performing association analysis, we identified more than 1 million novel disease-phenotype association pairs that were previously missed by human annotation, and >60% were confirmed true associations via manual review of a list of sampled pairs. Compared to the manual curated annotation, OARD is 100% data driven and its pipeline can be shared across different institutions. By supporting privacy-preserving sharing of aggregated summary statistics, such as term frequencies and disease-phenotype associations, it fills an important gap to facilitate data-driven research in the rare disease community.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common complex condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. Polygenic prediction could enhance CKD screening and prevention; however, this approach has not been optimized for ancestrally diverse populations. By combining APOL1 risk genotypes with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of kidney function, we designed, optimized and validated a genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) for CKD. The new GPS was tested in 15 independent cohorts, including 3 cohorts of European ancestry (n\u2009=\u200997,050), 6 cohorts of African ancestry (n\u2009=\u200914,544), 4 cohorts of Asian ancestry (n\u2009=\u20098,625) and 2 admixed Latinx cohorts (n\u2009=\u20093,625). We demonstrated score transferability with reproducible performance across all tested cohorts. The top 2% of the GPS was associated with nearly threefold increased risk of CKD across ancestries. In African ancestry cohorts, the APOL1 risk genotype and polygenic component of the GPS had additive effects on the risk of CKD.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that circulatory system diseases and nervous system disorders often co-occur in patients. However, genetic susceptibility factors shared between these disease categories remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized pleiotropy across 107 circulatory system and 40 nervous system traits using an ensemble of methods in the eMERGE Network and UK Biobank. Using a formal test of pleiotropy, five genomic loci demonstrated statistically significant evidence of pleiotropy. We observed region-specific patterns of direction of genetic effects for the two disease categories, suggesting potential antagonistic and synergistic pleiotropy. Our findings provide insights into the relationship between circulatory system diseases and nervous system disorders which can provide context for future prevention and treatment strategies.",

In this paper, we designed a total sample size extractor using a combination of syntactic and machine learning methods, and evaluated it on 300 Covid-19 abstracts (Covid-Set) and 100 generic RCT abstracts (General-Set). To improve the performance, we applied transfer learning from a large public corpus of annotated abstracts. We achieved an average F1 score of 0.73 on the Covid-Set testing set, and 0.60 on the General-Set using exact matches. The F1 scores for loose matches on both datasets were over 0.74. Compared with the state-of-the-art tool, our extractor reports total sample sizes directly and improved F1 scores by at least 4% without transfer learning. We demonstrated that transfer learning improved the sample size extraction accuracy and minimized human labor on annotations.",

A lack of computational representations and information extraction solutions for complex interventions hinders accurate and efficient evidence synthesis. In this study, we manually annotated and analyzed 3,447 intervention snippets from 261 randomized clinical trial (RCT) abstracts and developed a compositional representation for complex interventions, which captures the spatial, temporal and Boolean relations between intervention components, along with an intervention normalization pipeline that automates three tasks: (i) treatment entity extraction; (ii) intervention component relation extraction; and (iii) attribute extraction and association. 361 intervention snippets from 29 unseen abstracts were included to report on the performance of the evaluation. The average F-measure was 0.74 for treatment entity extraction on an exact match and 0.82 for attribute extraction. The F-measure for relation extraction of multi-component complex interventions was 0.90. 93% of extracted attributes were correctly attributed to corresponding treatment entities.",

It enables user configuration of 13 clinical trial features and 4 metrics (Jaccard similarity, semantic-based similarity, temporal overlap and geographical distance) to measure pairwise trial similarities. Among 1,007 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) trials conducted in the United States, 91.9% were found to have similar trials with the similarity threshold being 0.85 and 43.8% were highly similar with the threshold 0.95.

In addition, findings extracted from the literature are represented as free-text, which is not amenable to computation. This research extends the PICO framework with Observation elements, which capture the observed effect that an Intervention has on an Outcome, forming Intervention-Observation-Outcome triplets. In addition, we present a framework to normalize Observation elements with respect to their significance and the direction of the effect, as well as a rule-based approach to perform the normalization of these attributes. Our method achieves macro-averaged F1 scores of 0.82 and 0.73 for identifying the significance and direction attributes, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Measurement concepts are essential to observational healthcare research; however, a lack of concept harmonization limits the quality of research that can be done on multisite research networks. We developed five methods that used a combination of automated, semi-automated and manual approaches for generating measurement concept sets. We validated our concept sets by calculating their frequencies in cohorts from the Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) database. For heart transplant patients, the preoperative frequencies of basic metabolic panel concept sets, which we generated by a semi-automated approach, were greater than 99%. We also made concept sets for lumbar puncture and coagulation panels, by automated and manual methods respectively.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of delirium in electronic health records (EHRs) remains difficult due to inadequate assessment or under-documentation. The purpose of this research is to present a classification model that identifies delirium using retrospective EHR data. Delirium was confirmed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Age, sex, Elixhauser comorbidity index, drug exposures, and diagnoses were used as features. The model was developed based on the Columbia University Irving Medical Center EHR data and further validated with the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III dataset. Seventy-six patients from Surgical/Cardiothoracic ICU were included in the model. The logistic regression model achieved the best performance in identifying delirium; mean AUC of 0.874\u2009\u00b1\u20090.033. The mean positive predictive value of the logistic regression model was 0.80. The model promises to identify delirium cases with EHR data, thereby enable a sustainable infrastructure to build a retrospective cohort of delirium.",

Existing terminologies are insufficient to standardize outcomes and their measures, temporal attributes, quantitative metrics, and other attributes.

However, the data are often siloed, disorganized, and not broadly accessible due to discipline-specific differences in terminology and representation. To address these challenges, the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium has developed and tested a pilot knowledge graph-based \"Translator\" system capable of integrating existing biomedical data sets and \"translating\" those data into insights intended to augment human reasoning and accelerate translational science. Having demonstrated feasibility of the Translator system, the Translator program has since moved into development, and the Translator Consortium has made significant progress in the research, design, and implementation of an operational system. Herein, we describe the current system's architecture, performance, and quality of results. We apply Translator to several real-world use cases developed in collaboration with subject-matter experts. Finally, we discuss the scientific and technical features of Translator and compare those features to other state-of-the-art, biomedical graph-based question-answering systems.",

A curated list of genes has been recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) for return of incidental findings. However, the pleiotropic effects of these genes are not fully known. Such effects could complicate genetic counseling when returning incidental findings.

        "Title": "Characterization and Function of the Interaction of Angiogenin With Alpha-Actinin 2.",
        "Abstract": "Angiogenin (ANG) is the first human tumor-derived angiogenic protein, which can promote angiogenesis and tumor growth. In a previous study, we identified alpha-actinin 2 (ACTN2), a cytoskeletal protein, as a direct interacting protein with angiogenin. However, the interaction between ANG and ACTN2 was not characterized in detail, which may provide information on the molecular mechanisms of ANG functions. In this study, we mapped the accurate binding domain and sites in ANG and ACTN2, respectively. In ANG, the residues from 83 to 105 are the smallest motif that can bind to ACTN2. We then use site mutation analysis to identify the precise binding sites of ANG in the interaction and found that the 101st residue arginine (R101) represents the critical residue involved in the ANG-ACTN2 interaction. In ACTN2, the residues from 383 to 632, containing two spectrin domains in the middle of the rod structure of ACTN2, play an important role in the interaction. Furthermore, we validated the interaction of ACTN2-383-632 to ANG by glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay. In functional analysis, overexpressed ACTN2-383-632 could impair tumor cell motility observably, including cell migration and invasion. Meanwhile, ACTN2-383-632 overexpression inhibited tumor cell proliferation and survival as well. These data suggest that an excess expression of ACTN2 segment ACTN2-383-632 can inhibit tumor cell motility and proliferation by interfering with the interaction between ANG and ACTN2, which provides a potential mechanism of ANG action in tumor growth and metastasis.",

        "Abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a defining feature of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the leading causes of disability and mortality in the elderly population. Assessing cognitive impairment is important for diagnostic, clinical management, and research purposes. The Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most common screening measure of cognitive function, yet this score is not consistently available in the electronic health records. We conducted a pilot study to extract frequently used concepts characterizing cognitive function from the clinical notes of AD patients in an Aging and Dementia clinical practice. Then we developed a model to infer the severity of cognitive impairment and created a subspecialized taxonomy for concepts associated with MMSE scores. We evaluated the taxonomy and the severity prediction model and presented example use cases of this model.",

        "Abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a primary kidney cancer with high aggressive phenotype and extremely poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play pivotal roles in the occurrence and development of various human cancers. However, the expression, clinical significance and regulatory role of circRNAs in ccRCC remain largely unclear. Here we report that circDVL1 to be reduced in the serums and tissues from ccRCC patients, and to negatively correlate with ccRCC malignant features. Overexpression of circDVL1 inhibits proliferation, induces G1/S arrest, triggers apoptosis, and reduces migration and invasion in different ccRCC cells ",

        "Abstract": "Mature microRNA (miRNA) decay is a key step in miRNA turnover and gene expression regulation. Angiogenin (ANG), the first human tumor-derived angiogenic protein and also a member of the RNase A superfamily, can promote tumor growth and metastasis by regulating rRNA biogenesis and tiRNA production. However, its effect on miRNA has not been explored. In this study, we find that ANG exclusively downregulates mature miR-141 in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) via its ribonuclease activity and preferably cleaves single-stranded miR-141 at the A",

        "Abstract": "Currently, one of the commonly used methods for disseminating electronic health record (EHR)-based phenotype algorithms is providing a narrative description of the algorithm logic, often accompanied by flowcharts. A challenge with this mode of dissemination is the potential for under-specification in the algorithm definition, which leads to ambiguity and vagueness.",

The goals of this study are to quantify and qualify the disagreement between human and NLP. We developed an NLP system for annotating clinical trial eligibility criteria text and constructed a manually annotated corpus, both following the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). We analyzed the discrepancies between the human and NLP annotations and their causes (e.g., ambiguities in concept categorization and tacit decisions on inclusion of qualifiers and temporal attributes during concept annotation). This study initially reported complexities in clinical trial eligibility criteria text that complicate NLP and the limitations of the OMOP CDM. The disagreement between and human and NLP annotations may be generalizable. We discuss implications for NLP evaluation.",

In this paper, we propose a model to predict whether a patient infected with COVID-19 will develop severe outcomes based only on the patient's historical electronic health records (EHR) prior to hospital admission using recurrent neural networks. The model predicts risk score that represents the probability for a patient to progress into severe status (mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, or death) after being infected with COVID-19. The model achieved 0.846 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in predicting patients' outcomes averaged over 5-fold cross validation. While many of the existing models use features obtained after diagnosis of COVID-19, our proposed model only utilizes a patient's historical EHR to enable proactive risk management at the time of hospital admission.",

        "Abstract": "Human genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, have a wide variety of clinical phenotypic presentations, and characterizing each nuanced phenotype and subtype can be difficult. In this study, we examined the electronic health records of 4095 individuals with Down syndrome at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to create a method to characterize the phenotypic spectrum digitally. We extracted Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms from quality-filtered patient notes using a natural language processing (NLP) approach MetaMap. We catalogued the most common HPO terms related to Down syndrome patients and compared the terms with those from a baseline population. We characterized the top 100 HPO terms by their frequencies at different ages of clinical visits and highlighted selected terms that have time-dependent distributions. We also discovered phenotypic terms that have not been significantly associated with Down syndrome, such as \"Proptosis\", \"Downslanted palpebral fissures\", and \"Microtia\". In summary, our study demonstrated that the clinical phenotypic spectrum of individual with Mendelian diseases can be characterized through NLP-based digital phenotyping on population-scale electronic health records (EHRs).",

        "Abstract": "Hundreds of interventional clinical trials have been launched in the United States to identify effective treatment strategies for combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, to date, only a small fraction of these trials have completed enrollment, delaying the scientific investigation of COVID-19 and its treatment options. This study presents novel metrics to examine the geographic alignment between COVID-19 hotspots and interventional clinical trial sites and evaluate trial access over time during the evolving pandemic. Using temporal COVID-19 case data from USAFacts.org and trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov, U.S. counties were categorized based on their numbers of cases and trials. Our analysis suggests that alignment and access have worsened as the pandemic shifted over time. We recommend strategies and metrics to evaluate the alignment between cases and trials. Future studies are warranted to investigate the impact of the misalignment of cases and clinical trial sites on clinical trial recruitment.",

        "Abstract": "Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) encourages clinicians to seek the most reputable evidence. The quality of evidence is organized in a hierarchy in which randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as least biased. However, RCTs are plagued by poor generalizability, impeding the translation of clinical research to practice. Though the presence of poor external validity is known, the factors that contribute to poor generalizability have not been summarized and placed in a framework. We propose a new population-oriented conceptual framework to facilitate consistent and comprehensive evaluation of generalizability, replicability, and assessment of RCT study quality.",

        "Abstract": "Labeling clinical data from electronic health records (EHR) in health systems requires extensive knowledge of human expert, and painstaking review by clinicians. Furthermore, existing phenotyping algorithms are not uniformly applied across large datasets and can suffer from inconsistencies in case definitions across different algorithms. We describe here quantitative disease risk scores based on almost unsupervised methods that require minimal input from clinicians, can be applied to large datasets, and alleviate some of the main weaknesses of existing phenotyping algorithms. We show applications to phenotypic data on approximately 100,000 individuals in eMERGE, and focus on several complex diseases, including Chronic Kidney Disease, Coronary Artery Disease, Type 2 Diabetes, Heart Failure, and a few others. We demonstrate that relative to existing approaches, the proposed methods have higher prediction accuracy, can better identify phenotypic features relevant to the disease under consideration, can perform better at clinical risk stratification, and can identify undiagnosed cases based on phenotypic features available in the EHR. Using genetic data from the eMERGE-seq panel that includes sequencing data for 109 genes on 21,363 individuals from multiple ethnicities, we also show how the new quantitative disease risk scores help improve the power of genetic association studies relative to the standard use of disease phenotypes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of quantitative disease risk scores derived from rich phenotypic EHR databases to provide a more meaningful characterization of clinical risk for diseases of interest beyond the prevalent binary (case-control) classification.",

Hypertension (HTN) is a major public health concern. The validity of HTN data and definition of hypertension cases in the All of Us (AoU) Research Program for use in rule-based algorithms is unknown. In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we\u00a0compare HTN prevalence in the AoU Research Program to HTN prevalence in the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We used AoU baseline data from patient (age\u2009\u2265\u200918) measurements (PM), surveys, and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements. We retrospectively examined the prevalence of HTN in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR. We defined HTN as the participant having at least 2 HTN diagnosis/billing codes on separate dates in the EHR data AND at least one HTN medication. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59,\u2009and\u00a0\u2265\u200960). Among the 185,770 participants enrolled in the AoU Cohort (mean age at enrollment\u2009=\u200951.2\u00a0years) available in a Researcher Workbench as of October 2019, EHR data was available for at least one SNOMED code from 112,805 participants, medications for 104,230 participants, and 103,490 participants had both medication and SNOMED data. The total number of persons with SNOMED codes on at least two distinct dates and at least one antihypertensive medication was 33,310 for a crude prevalence of HTN of 32.2%. AoU age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% using 3 groups compared to 29.6% in NHANES. The AoU cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data to study hypertension nationwide and develop precision rule-based algorithms for use in hypertension treatment and prevention research. The prevalence of hypertension in this cohort is similar to that in prior population-based surveys.",

        "Abstract": "The recognition, disambiguation, and expansion of medical abbreviations and acronyms is of upmost importance to prevent medically-dangerous misinterpretation in natural language processing. To support recognition, disambiguation, and expansion, we present the Medical Abbreviation and Acronym Meta-Inventory, a deep database of medical abbreviations. A systematic harmonization of eight source inventories across multiple healthcare specialties and settings identified 104,057 abbreviations with 170,426 corresponding senses. Automated cross-mapping of synonymous records using state-of-the-art machine learning reduced redundancy, which simplifies future application. Additional features include semi-automated quality control to remove errors. The Meta-Inventory demonstrated high completeness or coverage of abbreviations and senses in new clinical text, a substantial improvement over the next largest repository (6-14% increase in abbreviation coverage; 28-52% increase in sense coverage). To our knowledge, the Meta-Inventory is the most complete compilation of medical abbreviations and acronyms in American English to-date. The multiple sources and high coverage support application in varied specialties and settings. This allows for cross-institutional natural language processing, which previous inventories did not support. The Meta-Inventory is available at https://bit.ly/github-clinical-abbreviations .",

We observed a high percentage (69.5%) of eMERGE phenotype features and a lower percentage (47.6%) of OHDSI phenotype features matched to clinical trial eligibility criteria, possibly due to the relative emphasis on specificity for eMERGE phenotypes and the relative emphasis on sensitivity for OHDSI phenotypes. The study results show the potential of reusing clinical trial eligibility criteria for phenotyping feature selection and moderate benefits of using them for local cohort query implementation.",

        "Abstract": "Life course research embraces the complexity of health and disease development, tackling the extensive interactions between genetics and environment. This interdisciplinary blueprint, or theoretical framework, offers a structure for research ideas and specifies relationships between related factors. Traditionally, methodological approaches attempt to reduce the complexity of these dynamic interactions and decompose health into component parts, ignoring the complex reciprocal interaction of factors that shape health over time. New methods that match the epistemological foundation of the life course framework are needed to fully explore adaptive, multilevel, and reciprocal interactions between individuals and their environment. The focus of this article is to (1) delineate the differences between lifespan and life course research, (2) articulate the importance of complex systems science as a methodological framework in the life course research toolbox to guide our research questions, (3) raise key questions that can be asked within the clinical and translational science domain utilizing this framework, and (4) provide recommendations for life course research implementation, charting the way forward. Recent advances in computational analytics, computer science, and data collection could be used to approximate, measure, and analyze the intertwining and dynamic nature of genetic and environmental factors involved in health development.",

        "Abstract": "Multi-center observational studies require recognition and reconciliation of differences in patient representations arising from underlying populations, disparate coding practices and specifics of data capture. This leads to different granularity or detail of concepts representing the clinical facts. For researchers studying certain populations of interest, it is important to ensure that concepts at the right level are used for the definition of these populations. We studied the granularity of concepts within 22 data sources in the OHDSI network and calculated a composite granularity score for each dataset. Three alternative SNOMED-based approaches for such score showed consistency in classifying data sources into three levels of granularity (low, moderate and high), which correlated with the provenance of data and country of origin. However, they performed unsatisfactorily in ordering data sources within these groups and showed inconsistency for small data sources. Further studies on examining approaches to data source granularity are needed.",

        "Abstract": "Rapidly increasing costs have been a major threat to our clinical research enterprise. Improvement in appointment scheduling is a crucial means to boost efficiency and save cost in clinical research and has been well studied in the outpatient setting. This study reviews nearly 5 years of usage data of an integrated scheduling system implemented at Columbia University/New York Presbyterian (CUIMC/NYP) called IMPACT and provides original insights into the challenges faced by a clinical research facility. Briefly, the IMPACT data shows that high rates of room and resource changes correlate with rescheduled appointments and that rescheduled visits are more likely to be attended than non-rescheduled visits. We highlight the differing roles of schedulers, coordinators, and investigators, and propose a highly accurate predictive model of participant no-shows in a research setting. This study sheds light on ways to reduce overall cost and improve the care we offer to clinical research participants.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical trials are essential for generating reliable medical evidence, but often suffer from expensive and delayed patient recruitment because the unstructured eligibility criteria description prevents automatic query generation for eligibility screening. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many trials have been created but their information is not computable. We included 700 COVID-19 trials available at the point of study and developed a semi-automatic approach to generate an annotated corpus for COVID-19 clinical trial eligibility criteria called COVIC. A hierarchical annotation schema based on the OMOP Common Data Model was developed to accommodate four levels of annotation granularity: i.e., study cohort, eligibility criteria, named entity and standard concept. In COVIC, 39 trials with more than one study cohorts were identified and labelled with an identifier for each cohort. 1,943 criteria for non-clinical characteristics such as \"informed consent\", \"exclusivity of participation\" were annotated. 9767 criteria were represented by 18,161 entities in 8 domains, 7,743 attributes of 7 attribute types and 16,443 relationships of 11 relationship types. 17,171 entities were mapped to standard medical concepts and 1,009 attributes were normalized into computable representations. COVIC can serve as a corpus indexed by semantic tags for COVID-19 trial search and analytics, and a benchmark for machine learning based criteria extraction.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a slowly progressive disorder that is typically silent until late stages, but early intervention can significantly delay its progression. We designed a portable and scalable electronic CKD phenotype to facilitate early disease recognition and empower large-scale observational and genetic studies of kidney traits. The algorithm uses a combination of rule-based and machine-learning methods to automatically place patients on the staging grid of albuminuria by glomerular filtration rate (\"A-by-G\" grid). We manually validated the algorithm by 451 chart reviews across three medical systems, demonstrating overall positive predictive value of 95% for CKD cases and 97% for healthy controls. Independent case-control validation using 2350 patient records demonstrated diagnostic specificity of 97% and sensitivity of 87%. Application of the phenotype to 1.3 million patients demonstrated that over 80% of CKD cases are undetected using ICD codes alone. We also demonstrated several large-scale applications of the phenotype, including identifying stage-specific kidney disease comorbidities, in silico estimation of kidney trait heritability in thousands of pedigrees reconstructed from medical records, and biobank-based multicenter genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies.",

        "Abstract": "How clinicians utilize medically actionable genomic information, displayed in the electronic health record (EHR), in medical decision-making remains unknown. Participating sites of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network have invested resources into EHR integration efforts to enable the display of genetic testing data across heterogeneous EHR systems. To assess clinicians' engagement with unsolicited EHR-integrated genetic test results of eMERGE participants within a large tertiary care academic medical center, we analyzed automatically generated EHR access log data. We found that clinicians viewed only 1% of all the eMERGE genetic test results integrated in the EHR. Using a cluster analysis, we also identified different user traits associated with varying degrees of engagement with the EHR-integrated genomic data. These data contribute important empirical knowledge about clinicians limited and brief engagements with unsolicited EHR-integrated genetic test results of eMERGE participants. Appreciation for user-specific roles provide additional context for why certain users were more or less engaged with the unsolicited results. This study highlights opportunities to use EHR log data as a performance metric to more precisely inform ongoing EHR-integration efforts and decisions about the allocation of informatics resources in genomic research.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic Health Record (EHR) data represents a valuable resource for individualized prospective prediction of health conditions. Statistical methods have been developed to measure patient similarity using EHR data, mostly using clinical attributes. Only a handful of recent methods have combined clinical analytics with other forms of similarity analytics, and no unified framework exists yet to measure comprehensive patient similarity. Here, we developed a generic framework named Patient similarity based on Domain Fusion (PsDF). PsDF performs patient similarity assessment on each available domain data separately, and then integrate the affinity information over various domains into a comprehensive similarity metric. We used the integrated patient similarity to support outcome prediction by assigning a risk score to each patient. With extensive simulations, we demonstrated that PsDF outperformed existing risk prediction methods including a random forest classifier, a regression-based model, and a na\u00efve similarity method, especially when heterogeneous signals exist across different domains. Using PsDF and EHR data extracted from the data warehouse of Columbia University Irving Medical Center, we developed two different clinical prediction tools for two different clinical outcomes: incident cases of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) and severe aortic stenosis (AS) requiring valve replacement. We demonstrated that our new prediction method is scalable to large datasets, robust to random missingness, and generalizable to diverse clinical outcomes.",

        "Title": "Caspase 3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis contributes to chemotherapy drug-induced nephrotoxicity.",
        "Abstract": "Chemotherapy drug-induced nephrotoxicity limits clinical applications for treating cancers. Pyroptosis, a newly discovered programmed cell death, was recently reported to be associated with kidney diseases. However, the role of pyroptosis in chemotherapeutic drug-induced nephrotoxicity has not been fully clarified. Herein, we demonstrate that the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin or doxorubicin, induces the cleavage of gasdermin E (GSDME) in cultured human renal tubular epithelial cells, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Morphologically, cisplatin- or doxorubicin-treated renal tubular epithelial cells exhibit large bubbles emerging from the cell membrane. Furthermore, activation of caspase 3, not caspase 9, is associated with GSDME cleavage in cisplatin- or doxorubicin-treated renal tubular epithelial cells. Meanwhile, silencing GSDME alleviates cisplatin- or doxorubicin-induced HK-2 cell pyroptosis by increasing cell viability and decreasing LDH release. In addition, treatment with Ac-DMLD-CMK, a polypeptide targeting mouse caspase 3-Gsdme signaling, inhibits caspase 3 and Gsdme activation, alleviates the deterioration of kidney function, attenuates renal tubular epithelial cell injury, and reduces inflammatory cytokine secretion in vivo. Specifically, GSDME cleavage depends on ERK and JNK signaling. NAC, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor, reduces GSDME cleavage through JNK signaling in human renal tubular epithelial cells. Thus, we speculate that renal tubular epithelial cell pyroptosis induced by chemotherapy drugs is mediated by ROS-JNK-caspase 3-GSDME signaling, implying that therapies targeting GSDME may prove efficacious in overcoming chemotherapeutic drug-induced nephrotoxicity.",

        "Abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has threatened the health of tens of millions of people worldwide and imposed heavy burden on global healthcare systems. In this paper, we propose a model to predict whether a patient infected with COVID-19 will develop severe outcomes based only on the patient's historical electronic health records (EHR) prior to hospital admission using recurrent neural networks. The model predicts risk score that represents the probability for a patient to progress into severe status (mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, or death) after being infected with COVID-19. The model achieved 0.846 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in predicting patients' outcomes averaged over 5-fold cross validation. While many of the existing models use features obtained after diagnosis of COVID-19, our proposed model only utilizes a patient's historical EHR to enable proactive risk management at the time of hospital admission.",

        "Abstract": "With the broader introduction of genomic medicine in research and clinical care, an increasing number of persons are offered genetic testing. Many factors, including genetic literacy, may impact the utilization of genetic results by patients and their families. We developed a rapid, self-administered measure of genetic literacy, called Genetic Literacy Fast Test (GeneLiFT). We next evaluated the association of GeneLiFT scores with the comprehension of limitations of genomic medicine in participants undergoing genetic testing in the NIH-sponsored eMERGE III study at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York. All participants underwent genetic screening for variants in 74 actionable genes associated with adult-onset disorders. A diverse cohort of 724 participants completed the survey (60% women, 45% less than 40\u00a0years old, and 53% self-reported White non-Hispanic ancestry). The GeneLiFT was validated using known group differences based on education, health literacy, and numeracy, and with questions assessing genetic knowledge. GeneLiFT identified multiple standard genetics terms, that is, jargon, not recognized by more than 50% of participants (including actionability and pathogenicity). Low genetic literacy, identified in 210 participants (29%), was significantly associated with poor understanding of the limitations of genetic testing (p-values\u00a0<\u00a010",

To facilitate recruitment, tools for patient search of relevant clinical trials have been developed, but users often suffer from information overload. With nearly 700 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) trials conducted in the United States as of August 2020, it is imperative to enable rapid recruitment to these studies. The COVID-19 Trial Finder was designed to facilitate patient-centered search of COVID-19 trials, first by location and radius distance from trial sites, and then by brief, dynamically generated medical questions to allow users to prescreen their eligibility for nearby COVID-19 trials with minimum human computer interaction. A simulation study using 20 publicly available patient case reports demonstrates its precision and effectiveness.",

We used a genome-wide association (GWAS) approach to discover genetic variants associated with CAAD in participants in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network. We identified adult CAAD cases with unilateral or bilateral carotid artery stenosis and controls without evidence of stenosis from electronic health records at eight eMERGE sites. We performed GWAS with a model adjusting for age, sex, study site, and genetic principal components of ancestry. In eMERGE we found 1793 CAAD cases and 17,958 controls.

        "Abstract": "An important need exists to better understand and stratify kidney disease according to its underlying pathophysiology in order to develop more precise and effective therapeutic agents. National collaborative efforts such as the Kidney Precision Medicine Project are working towards this goal through the collection and integration of large, disparate clinical, biological and imaging data from patients with kidney disease. Ontologies are powerful tools that facilitate these efforts by enabling researchers to organize and make sense of different data elements and the relationships between them. Ontologies are critical to support the types of big data analysis necessary for kidney precision medicine, where heterogeneous clinical, imaging and biopsy data from diverse sources must be combined to define a patient's phenotype. The development of two new ontologies - the Kidney Tissue Atlas Ontology and the Ontology of Precision Medicine and Investigation - will support the creation of the Kidney Tissue Atlas, which aims to provide a comprehensive molecular, cellular and anatomical map of the kidney. These ontologies will improve the annotation of kidney-relevant data, and eventually lead to new definitions of kidney disease in support of precision medicine.",

Various studies have reported that Notch signalling plays a significant role in kidney development and kidney diseases. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 10 (ADAM10), an upstream protease of the Notch pathway, is also reportedly involved in renal fibrosis. However, how ADAM10 interacts with the Notch pathway and causes renal fibrosis is not fully understood. In this study, using a prenatal chlorpyrifos (CPF) exposure mouse model, we investigated the role of the ADAM10/Notch axis in kidney development and fibrosis. We found that prenatal CPF-exposure mice presented overexpression of Adam10, Notch1 and Notch2, and led to premature depletion of Six2",

        "Title": "Calcineurin inhibitors ameliorate PAN-induced podocyte injury through the NFAT-Angptl4 pathway.",
        "Abstract": "Podocyte injury plays a vital role in proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome. Calcineurin (CaN) inhibitors are effective in reducing proteinuria. However, their molecular mechanism is still not fully understood. Angiopoietin-like-4 (ANGPTL4) is a secreted protein that mediates proteinuria in podocyte-related nephropathy. In this study, we established a puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced minimal-change disease (MCD) rat model and a cultured podocyte injury model. We found that CaN inhibitors protected against PAN-induced podocyte injury, accompanied by an inhibition of Nfatc1 and Angptl4 both in vivo and in vitro. Nfatc1 overexpression and knockdown experiments indicated that Angptl4 was regulated by Nfatc1 in podocytes. ChIP assays further demonstrated that Nfatc1 increased Angptl4 expression by binding to the Angptl4 promoter. In addition, overexpression and knockdown of Angptl4 revealed that Angptl4 directly induced rearrangement of the cytoskeleton of podocytes, reduced the expression of synaptopodin, and enhanced PAN-induced podocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, in a cohort of 83 MCD and 94 membranous nephropathy (MN) patients, we found increased expression of serum ANGPTL4 compared to 120 healthy controls, and there were close correlations between serum ANGPTL4 and Alb, urinary protein, urinary Alb, eGFR, Scr, and BUN in MCD patients. No obvious correlation was found in MN patients. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that increased ANGPTL4 in MCD and MN patients was located mostly in podocytes. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that CaN inhibitors ameliorate PAN-induced podocyte injury by targeting Angptl4 through the NFAT pathway, and Angptl4 plays a vital role in podocyte injury and is involved in human podocyte-related nephropathy. \u00a9 2020 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

        "Abstract": "We performed a trends analysis of experimental cancer interventions. The complete records of 32,623 interventional neoplasm clinical trials involving 454 types of neoplasms from 2000 to 2017 were downloaded from the AACT database. The conditions and drug concepts were normalized using MetaMap. The normalized frequencies (NF) for each type of intervention were calculated and compared. Among 95,440 interventions, 77.4% were drugs, 5.3% were radiation, 6.6% were surgery and 10.6% were other therapies. Among 47,754 arms, 82.8% were mono-type interventions and 17.2% were multi-type interventions. Among 73,889 drug interventions, immunologic factor drugs increased rapidly over the last five years. Both breast cancer and pancreatic cancer have been testing new drugs in clinical trials; however, more drugs have been tested in phase 3 or 4 trials and employed in comparator arms for breast cancer compared to pancreatic cancer. Breast cancer trials showed a more even drug NF distribution than pancreatic cancer trials. The JS Distance among three periods (2000-05 vs. 2006-11 vs. 2012-17) showed unidirectional research progress trend for breast cancer, but reverse trend for pancreatic cancer. This study contributes a large-scale landscape overview of the trends in cancer experimental interventions and a methodology for using public clinical trial summaries for understanding the evolving cancer research.",

The HPO annotation database is updated frequently and can provide detailed phenotype knowledge on various human diseases, and many HPO terms are now mapped to candidate causal genes with binary relationships. To further improve the genetic diagnosis of rare diseases, we incorporated these HPO annotations, gene-disease databases and gene-gene databases in a probabilistic model to build a novel HPO-driven gene prioritization tool, Phen2Gene. Phen2Gene accesses a database built upon this information called the HPO2Gene Knowledgebase (H2GKB), which provides weighted and ranked gene lists for every HPO term. Phen2Gene is then able to access the H2GKB for patient-specific lists of HPO terms or PhenoPacket descriptions supported by GA4GH (http://phenopackets.org/), calculate a prioritized gene list based on a probabilistic model and output gene-disease relationships with great accuracy. Phen2Gene outperforms existing gene prioritization tools in speed and acts as a real-time phenotype-driven gene prioritization tool to aid the clinical diagnosis of rare undiagnosed diseases. In addition to a command line tool released under the MIT license (https://github.com/WGLab/Phen2Gene), we also developed a web server and web service (https://phen2gene.wglab.org/) for running the tool via web interface or RESTful API queries. Finally, we have curated a large amount of benchmarking data for phenotype-to-gene tools involving 197 patients across 76 scientific articles and 85 patients' de-identified HPO term data from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.",

        "Abstract": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as the most reputable source of evidence. In some studies, factors beyond the intervention itself may contribute to the measured effect, an occurrence known as heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). If the RCT population differs from the real-world population on factors that induce HTE, the trials effect will not replicate. The RCTs eligibility criteria should identify the sub-population in which its evidence will replicate. However, the extent to which the eligibility criteria identify the appropriate population is unknown, which raises concerns for generalizability. We compared reported data from RCTs with real-world data from the electronic health records of a large, academic medical center that was curated according to RCT eligibility criteria. Our results show fundamental differences between the RCT population and our observational cohorts, which suggests that eligibility criteria may be insufficient for identifying the applicable real-world population in which RCT evidence will replicate.",

Studies have demonstrated that people want to learn about their genetic information and do well after learning it, but minorities are underrepresented in these studies. We surveyed Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) and Latino/a participants in a genetic screening study to solicit choices about genetic results to return, as well as their experience with learning these results and attitudes about genetic information secrecy and security. Participants had the option to proceed through the study self-guided, and few elected to have traditional pre-test genetic education and counseling. Despite this, the majority were satisfied with the process of selecting and receiving genetic results and felt that they understood their results. Concerns about privacy and confidentiality of genetic data were minimal, though some participants expressed modest concerns about keeping any potential results secret or the confidentiality of their genetic information. Our results support the feasibility of the option of self-guided genetic screening. Additional care will need to be taken when designing population-based screening studies to meet the needs of participants who come from communities with different experiences with genetics.",

Understanding how these platforms are used is critical to guide their effective development and implementation. This study contributes a log-based method to study user engagement with online genomic educational videos among participants in a genomic screening study. We collected baseline demographics, logged participant usage and compared pre- and post-education genomic knowledge. Participants (N=390) who chose website access differed from those who declined access (N=81) and were more likely to be non-Latino, English speaking, younger, and have higher educational attainment. Only 45% who accessed the website viewed at least one video. The average video exposure time was 12 minutes. Longer exposure was not associated with an improvement in the user's genomic knowledge. Our study and future studies of user analytics should be used to guide the development of effective, scalable genomic education methods.",

        "Abstract": "Angiotensinogen (AGT) is an essential member of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS); this system regulates blood pressure and affects the physiological function of the kidney. Studies found that mutations of the human AGT gene are involved in diseases such as recessive renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD) and essential hypertension (EHT). Here, we report a 29-year-old male Chinese with essential hypertension and cystic kidney disease. Exome sequencing analysis of the patient and his parents revealed a mutation in the splice donor site of intron 2 of the AGT gene, c.856+1G>T. This mutation was a heterozygous form and inherited from his mother, and the mother was diagnosed with essential hypertension lasting over 20 years. Function prediction of c.856+1G>T mutation using online software showed this intron mutation may affect protein features by destroying the normal splice site. These findings suggest that this intron mutation of the AGT gene is related to the patient's essential hypertension and cystic kidney disease.",

        "Abstract": "Scientific commentaries are expected to play an important role in evidence appraisal, but it is unknown whether this expectation has been fulfilled. This study aims to better understand the role of scientific commentary in evidence appraisal. We queried PubMed for all clinical research articles with accompanying comments and extracted corresponding metadata. Five percent of clinical research studies (N\u2009=\u2009130\u00a0629) received postpublication comments (N\u2009=\u2009171\u00a0556), resulting in 178\u00a0882 comment-article pairings, with 90% published in the same journal. We obtained 5197 full-text comments for topic modeling and exploratory sentiment analysis. Topics were generally disease specific with only a few topics relevant to the appraisal of studies, which were highly prevalent in letters. Of a random sample of 518 full-text comments, 67% had a supportive tone. Based on our results, published commentary, with the exception of letters, most often highlight or endorse previous publications rather than serve as a prominent mechanism for critical appraisal.",

        "Title": "Adapting electronic health records-derived phenotypes to claims data: Lessons learned in using limited clinical data for phenotyping.",
        "Abstract": "Algorithms for identifying patients of interest from observational data must address missing and inaccurate data and are desired to achieve comparable performance on both administrative claims and electronic health records data. However, administrative claims data do not contain the necessary information to develop accurate algorithms for disorders that require laboratory results, and this omission can result in insensitive diagnostic code-based algorithms. In this paper, we tested our assertion that the performance of a diagnosis code-based algorithm for chronic kidney disorder (CKD) can be improved by adding other codes indirectly related to CKD (e.g., codes for dialysis, kidney transplant, suspicious kidney disorders). Following the best practices from Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), we adapted an electronic health record-based gold standard algorithm for CKD and then created algorithms that can be executed on administrative claims data and account for related data quality issues. We externally validated our algorithms on four electronic health record datasets in the OHDSI network. Compared to the algorithm that uses CKD diagnostic codes only, positive predictive value of the algorithms that use additional codes was slightly increased (47.4% vs. 47.9-48.5% respectively). The algorithms adapted from the gold standard algorithm can be used to infer chronic kidney disorder based on administrative claims data. We succeeded in improving the generalizability and consistency of the CKD phenotypes by using data and vocabulary standardized across the OHDSI network, although performance variability across datasets remains. We showed that identifying and addressing coding and data heterogeneity can improve the performance of the algorithms.",

        "Abstract": "Genomic knowledge is being translated into clinical care. To fully realize the value, it is critical to place credible information in the hands of clinicians in time to support clinical decision making. The electronic health record is an essential component of clinician workflow. Utilizing the electronic health record to present information to support the use of genomic medicine in clinical care to improve outcomes represents a tremendous opportunity. However, there are numerous barriers that prevent the effective use of the electronic health record for this purpose. The electronic health record working groups of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network and the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) project, along with other groups, have been defining these barriers, to allow the development of solutions that can be tested using implementation pilots. In this paper, we present \"lessons learned\" from these efforts to inform future efforts leading to the development of effective and sustainable solutions that will support the realization of genomic medicine.",

        "Abstract": "We recently described a new neurodevelopmental syndrome (TAF1/MRXS33 intellectual disability syndrome) (MIM# 300966) caused by pathogenic variants involving the X-linked gene TAF1, which participates in RNA polymerase II transcription. The initial study reported eleven families, and the syndrome was defined as presenting early in life with hypotonia, facial dysmorphia, and developmental delay that evolved into intellectual disability (ID) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have now identified an additional 27 families through a genotype-first approach. Familial segregation analysis, clinical phenotyping, and bioinformatics were capitalized on to assess potential variant pathogenicity, and molecular modelling was performed for those variants falling within structurally characterized domains of TAF1. A novel phenotypic clustering approach was also applied, in which the phenotypes of affected individuals were classified using 51 standardized Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. Phenotypes associated with TAF1 variants show considerable pleiotropy and clinical variability, but prominent among previously unreported effects were brain morphological abnormalities, seizures, hearing loss, and heart malformations. Our allelic series broadens the phenotypic spectrum of TAF1/MRXS33 intellectual disability syndrome and the range of TAF1 molecular defects in humans. It also illustrates the challenges for determining the pathogenicity of inherited missense variants, particularly for genes mapping to chromosome X. This article is protected by copyright.

In this paper, we evaluate the use of genomic test reports ordered for cancer patients in order to derive cancer subtypes and to identify biological pathways predictive of poor survival outcomes. A novel method is proposed to calculate patient similarity based on affected biological pathways rather than gene mutations. We demonstrate that this approach identifies subtypes of prognostic value and biological pathways linked to survival, with implications for precision treatment selection and a better understanding of the underlying disease. We also share lessons learned regarding the opportunities and challenges of secondary use of observational genomic data to conduct such research.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer management, including supportive care, is complex and requires availability and synthesis of published and patient-specific data to make appropriate therapeutic decisions. Clinical decision support (CDS) may be an effective implementation strategy to support complex decision making although it is unclear whether it improves process outcomes, patient outcomes or both in cancer settings. We therefore conducted a systematic review to identify CDS that have been used to support therapeutic decision making in clinical cancer settings. Outcomes of interest included the effect of CDS on the process, such as clinician's decision making and effect on patient outcomes. Ten studies met inclusion criteria, with variability in the study design, setting, and intervention. Of the nine studies that measured process outcomes, five demonstrated significant improvement; and of the six that measured patient outcomes, four demonstrated significant improvement. All included studies utilized CDS that were informed by clinical practice guidelines. In conclusion, CDS to guide cancer therapeutic decision making is an understudied but promising area. Further research is needed.",

        "Abstract": "The advancement of precision medicine requires new methods to coordinate and deliver genetic data from heterogeneous sources to physicians and patients. The eMERGE III Network enrolled >25,000 participants from biobank and prospective cohorts of predominantly healthy individuals for clinical genetic testing to determine clinically actionable findings. The network developed protocols linking together the 11 participant collection sites and 2 clinical genetic testing laboratories. DNA capture panels targeting 109 genes were used for testing of DNA and sample collection, data generation, interpretation, reporting, delivery, and storage were each harmonized. A compliant and secure network enabled ongoing review and reconciliation of clinical interpretations, while maintaining communication and data sharing between clinicians and investigators. A total of 202 individuals had positive diagnostic findings relevant to the indication for testing and 1,294 had additional/secondary findings of medical significance deemed to be returnable, establishing data return rates for other testing endeavors. This study accomplished integration of structured genomic results into multiple electronic health record (EHR) systems, setting the stage for clinical decision support to enable genomic medicine. Further, the established processes enable different sequencing sites to harmonize technical and interpretive aspects of sequencing tests, a critical achievement toward global standardization of genomic testing. The eMERGE protocols and tools are available for widespread dissemination.",

Mediated query is commonly adopted to facilitate data access for investigators. However, the query mediation process remains a black-box. This study analyzed the email-based dialogues between investigators and clinical data query mediators from three institutions. We identify discussion topics and their frequencies, model task flows, and analyze user needs for query mediation support revealed from the dialogues. While the datasets between different institutions are distinct in some notable respects, we find that together they provide common insights for streamlining data access. From our findings, we conclude an intelligent dialogue-based query support model is feasible to automate human-mediated clinical data access for investigators and stakeholders.",

The 1,508 valid respondents comprised 58.7% males, 54% without college degrees, 41.5% students or unemployed, and 84.3% under 40 years old. More than 74% were somewhat willing to share de-identified records. Education level, employment status, and gender were identified as significant predictors of willingness to share one's own or one's family's medical records (partially identifiable, completely identifiable, or de-identified). Thematic analysis applied to respondent comments uncovered barriers to sharing, including the inability to track uses and users of their information, potential harm (such as identity theft or healthcare denial), lack of trust, and worries about information misuse. Our study suggests that implementing reliable medical record de-identification and emphasizing trust development are essential to addressing such concerns. Amazon Mechanical Turk proved cost-effective for collecting public opinions with short surveys.",

Generated text is evaluated using both computational methods and clinician and lay user feedback.

In this research, we proposed a data driven method, that is, integrating a variety of publicly available data resources including Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and cui2vec concept embedding to construct a mental disease similarity network. The resulting mental disease similarity network offered a new view for navigating and investigating disease relations; it also revealed popular mental disease in the literature in terms of the number of connections and similarities with other diseases. It shows that depressive disorder is directly connected with nine other popular diseases and connects 52 other diseases in the network. The top three popular mental diseases are depressive disorder, dysthymia (now known as persistent depressive disorder), and neurosis. Future research will focus on studying the clusters generated from the similarity network.",

In this manuscript, we contribute methodology for data quality assessment by plotting domain-level (conditions (diagnoses), drugs, and procedures) aggregate statistics and concept-level temporal frequencies (i.e., annual prevalence rates of clinical concepts). We detect common temporal patterns in concept frequencies by normalizing and clustering annual concept frequencies using K-means clustering. We apply these methods to the Columbia University Irving Medical Center Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership database. The resulting domain-aggregate and cluster plots show a variety of patterns. We review the patterns found in the condition domain and investigate the processes that shape them. We find that these patterns suggest data quality issues influenced by system-wide factors that affect individual concept frequencies.",

By initializing our model with pretrained parameters from a large related corpus, we improved the model performance significantly with a minimal feature set. Our method has advantages in minimizing the need for laborious feature handcrafting and in avoiding the need for large shared annotated data by reusing related corpora in pretraining with a deep neural network.",

        "Abstract": "This study reports the first assessment of published comments in the family medicine literature using structured codes, which produced commentary annotations that will be the foundation of a knowledge base of appraisals of family medicine trials. Evidence appraisal occurs in a variety of formats and serves to shed light on the quality of research. However, scientific discourse generally and evidence appraisal in particular has not itself been analyzed for insights. A search strategy was devised to identify all journal comments indexed in PubMed linked to controlled intervention studies published in a recent 15-year period in major family medicine journals. A previously developed structured representation in the form of a list of appraisal concepts was used to formally annotate and categorize the journal comments through an iterative process. Trends in family medicine evidence appraisal were then analyzed. A total of 93 comments on studies from five journals over 15 years were included in the analysis. Two thirds of extracted appraisals were negative criticisms. All appraisals of measurement instruments were negative (100%). The participants baseline characteristics, the author discussions, and the design of the interventions were also criticized (respectively 91.7%, 84.6% and 83.3% negative). In contrast, appraisals of the scientific basis of the studies were positive (81.8%). The categories with the most appraisals were, most generally, those focused on the study design, and most specifically, those focused on the scientific basis. This study provides a new data-driven approach to review scientific discourse regarding the strengths and limitations of research within academic family medicine. This methodology can potentially generalize to other medical domains. Structured appraisal data generated here will enable future clinical, scientific, and policy decision-making and broader meta-research in family medicine.",

        "Abstract": "The link between cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders has been widely observed in the aging population. Disease prevention and treatment rely on understanding the potential genetic nexus of multiple diseases in these categories. In this study, we were interested in detecting pleiotropy, or the phenomenon in which a genetic variant influences more than one phenotype. Marker-phenotype association approaches can be grouped into univariate, bivariate, and multivariate categories based on the number of phenotypes considered at one time. Here we applied one statistical method per category followed by an eQTL colocalization analysis to identify potential pleiotropic variants that contribute to the link between cardiovascular and neurological diseases. We performed our analyses on ~530,000 common SNPs coupled with 65 electronic health record (EHR)-based phenotypes in 43,870 unrelated European adults from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. There were 31 variants identified by all three methods that showed significant associations across late onset cardiac- and neurologic- diseases. We further investigated functional implications of gene expression on the detected \"lead SNPs\" via colocalization analysis, providing a deeper understanding of the discovered associations. In summary, we present the framework and landscape for detecting potential pleiotropy using univariate, bivariate, multivariate, and colocalization methods. Further exploration of these potentially pleiotropic genetic variants will work toward understanding disease causing mechanisms across cardiovascular and neurological diseases and may assist in considering disease prevention as well as drug repositioning in future research.",

We carried out a four-phase analysis of clinical case studies to characterize how such processes are represented through relationships between clinical terms. The result is an terminology of 26 relationships that were validated against published clinical cases with 85.4% interrater reliability. We believe that capturing patient-specific information with these relationships can lead to improvements in clinical decision support systems, information retrieval and learning health systems.",

        "Title": "Semi-supervised learning to improve generalizability of risk prediction models.",
        "Abstract": "The utility of a prediction model depends on its generalizability to patients drawn from different but related populations. We explored whether a semi-supervised learning model could improve the generalizability of colorectal cancer (CRC) risk prediction relative to supervised learning methods. Data on 113,141 patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic CRC from 2004 to 2012 were obtained from the Surveillance Epidemiology End Results registry for model development, and data on 1149 patients from the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, who were diagnosed between 2004 and 2011, were collected for generalizability testing. A clinical prediction model for CRC survival risk using a semi-supervised logistic regression method was developed and validated to investigate the model discrimination, calibration, generalizability, interpretability and clinical usefulness. Rigorous model performance comparisons with other supervised learning models were performed. The area under the curve of the logistic membership model revealed a large heterogeneity between the development cohort and validation cohort, which is typical of generalizability studies of prediction models. The discrimination was good for all models. Calibration was poor for supervised learning models, while the semi-supervised logistic regression model exhibited a good calibration on the validation cohort, which indicated good generalizability. Clinical usefulness analysis showed that semi-supervised logistic regression can lead to better clinical outcomes than supervised learning methods. These results increase our current understanding of the generalizability of different models and provide a reference for predictive model development for clinical decision-making.",

        "Abstract": "Columbia Open Health Data (COHD) is a publicly accessible database of electronic health record (EHR) prevalence and co-occurrence frequencies between conditions, drugs, procedures, and demographics. COHD was derived from Columbia University Irving Medical Center's Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) database. The lifetime dataset, derived from all records, contains 36,578 single concepts (11,952 conditions, 12,334 drugs, and 10,816 procedures) and 32,788,901 concept pairs from 5,364,781 patients. The 5-year dataset, derived from records from 2013-2017, contains 29,964 single concepts (10,159 conditions, 10,264 drugs, and 8,270 procedures) and 15,927,195 concept pairs from 1,790,431 patients. Exclusion of rare concepts (count\u2009\u2264\u200910) and Poisson randomization enable data sharing by eliminating risks to patient privacy. EHR prevalences are informative of healthcare consumption rates. Analysis of co-occurrence frequencies via relative frequency analysis and observed-expected frequency ratio are informative of associations between clinical concepts, useful for biomedical research tasks such as drug repurposing and pharmacovigilance. COHD is publicly accessible through a web application-programming interface (API) and downloadable from the Figshare repository. The code is available on GitHub.",

However, with the ushering in of the age of \"big data,\" new methods for discovery of such information become necessary as traditional techniques become increasingly difficult to apply due to the exponential growth of document repositories. Our objectives are to develop a pipeline for unsupervised theme extraction and summarization of thematic trends in document repositories, and to test it by applying it to a specific domain.",

        "Title": "The regulatory network of miR-141 in the inhibition of angiogenesis.",
        "Abstract": "The miR-200 family, consisting of miR-200a/b/c, miR-141, and miR-429, is well known to inhibit epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer invasion and metastasis. Among the miR-200 family members, miR-200a/b/c and miR-429 have been reported to inhibit angiogenesis. However, the role of miR-141 in angiogenesis remains elusive, as contradicting results have been found in different cancer types and tumor models. Particularly, the effect of miR-141 in vascular endothelial cells has not been defined. In this study, we used several in vitro and in vivo models to demonstrate that miR-141 in endothelial cells inhibits angiogenesis. Additional mechanistic studies showed that miR-141 suppresses angiogenesis through multiple targets, including NRP1, GAB1, CXCL12\u03b2, TGF\u03b22, and GATA6, and bioinformatics analysis indicated that miR-141 and its targets comprise a powerful and precise regulatory network to modulate angiogenesis. Taken together, these data not only demonstrate an anti-angiogenic effect of miR-141, further strengthening the critical role of miR-200 family in the process of angiogenesis, but also provides a valuable cancer therapeutic target to control both angiogenesis and EMT, two essential steps in tumor growth and metastasis.",

        "Abstract": "Genomic medicine is moving from research to the clinic. There is a lack of evidence about the impact of genomic medicine interventions on health outcomes. This is due in part to a lack of standardized outcome measures that can be used across different programs to evaluate the impact of interventions targeted to specific genetic conditions. The eMERGE Outcomes working group (OWG) developed measures to collect information on outcomes following the return of genomic results to participants for several genetic disorders. These outcomes were compared to outcome intervention pairs for genetic disorders developed independently by the ClinGen Actionability working group (AWG). In general, there was concordance between the defined outcomes between the two groups. The ClinGen outcomes tended to be from a higher level and the AWG scored outcomes represented a subset of outcomes referenced in the accompanying AWG evidence review. eMERGE OWG outcomes were more detailed and discrete, facilitating a collection of relevant information from the health records. This paper demonstrates that common outcomes for genomic medicine interventions can be identified. Further work is needed to standardize outcomes across genomic medicine implementation projects and to make these publicly available to enhance dissemination and assist in making precision public health a reality.",

        "Abstract": "Integration of detailed phenotype information with genetic data is well established to facilitate accurate diagnosis of hereditary disorders. As a rich source of phenotype information, electronic health records (EHRs) promise to empower diagnostic variant interpretation. However, how to accurately and efficiently extract phenotypes from heterogeneous EHR narratives remains a challenge. Here, we present EHR-Phenolyzer, a high-throughput EHR framework for extracting and analyzing phenotypes. EHR-Phenolyzer extracts and normalizes Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts from EHR narratives and then prioritizes genes with causal variants on the basis of the HPO-coded phenotype manifestations. We assessed EHR-Phenolyzer on 28 pediatric individuals with confirmed diagnoses of monogenic diseases and found that the genes with causal variants were ranked among the top 100 genes selected by EHR-Phenolyzer for 16/28 individuals (p < 2.2\u00a0\u00d7 10",

        "Abstract": "Noninvasive monitoring methods of immune status are preferred by transplant recipients. The present study investigated whether urinary C\u2011X\u2011C motif chemokine 13 (CXCL13) had the potential to reflect ongoing immune processes within renal allografts. Using an ELISA assay, the level of urinary CXCL13 was quantified in a total of 146 renal allograft recipients and 40\u00a0healthy controls at scheduled intervals and at the time of the indicated or protocol biopsy. The results of the present study revealed that urinary CXCL13/creatinine (Cr) was lower in normal transplants compared with in those with acute tubular necrosis (ATN; P=0.001), chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN; P=0.01), and acute rejection (AR; P<0.0001), which was associated with a good diagnostic performance for AR [area under the curve (AUC)=0.818, P<0.0001). In addition, urinary CXCL13/Cr levels in patients with AR were also higher than that of patients with graft dysfunction but no rejection, including ATN and CAN (P=0.034). Notably, urinary CXCL13 distinguished between acute antibody\u2011mediated rejection (ABMR) and acute cellular rejection, with an AUC of 0.856. Furthermore, patients with steroid\u2011resistant AR exhibited significantly increased urinary CXCL13/Cr levels than patients with reversible AR (P=0.001). Additionally, elevated levels of urinary CXCL13/Cr within the first month of transplant were predictive of graft function at 3 and 6\u00a0months (P=0.044 and P=0.04, respectively). Collectively, the findings of the present study indicated that the noninvasive investigation of urinary CXCL13/Cr may be valuable for the detection of AR, particularly ABMR. In addition, high urinary CXCL13/Cr levels predicted a poor response to steroid treatment and compromised graft function.",

        "Abstract": "Much effort has been devoted to leverage EHR data for matching patients into clinical trials. However, EHRs may not contain all important data elements for clinical research eligibility screening. To better design research-friendly EHRs, an important step is to identify data elements frequently used for eligibility screening but not yet available in EHRs. This study fills this knowledge gap. Using the Alzheimer's disease domain as an example, we performed text mining on the eligibility criteria text in Clinicaltrials.gov to identify frequently used eligibility criteria concepts. We compared them to the EHR data elements of a cohort of Alzheimer's Disease patients to assess the data gap by usingthe OMOP Common Data Model to standardize the representations for both criteria concepts and EHR data elements. We identified the most common SNOMED CT concepts used in Alzheimer 's Disease trials, andfound 40% of common eligibility criteria concepts were not even defined in the concept space in the EHR dataset for a cohort of Alzheimer 'sDisease patients, indicating a significant data gap may impede EHR-based eligibility screening. The results of this study can be useful for designing targeted research data collection forms to help fill the data gap in the EHR.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) provide great promise for identifying cohorts and enhancing research recruitment. Such approaches are sorely needed, but there are few descriptions in the literature of prevailing practices to guide their use. A multidisciplinary workgroup was formed to examine current practices in the use of EHRs in recruitment and to propose future directions. The group surveyed consortium members regarding current practices. Over 98% of the Clinical and Translational Science Award Consortium responded to the survey. Brokered and self-service data warehouse access are in early or full operation at 94% and 92% of institutions, respectively, whereas, EHR alerts to providers and to research teams are at 45% and 48%, respectively, and use of patient portals for research is at 20%. However, these percentages increase significantly to 88% and above if planning and exploratory work were considered cumulatively. For most approaches, implementation reflected perceived demand. Regulatory and workflow processes were similarly varied, and many respondents described substantive restrictions arising from logistical constraints and limitations on collaboration and data sharing. Survey results reflect wide variation in implementation and approach, and point to strong need for comparative research and development of best practices to protect patients and facilitate interinstitutional collaboration and multisite research.",

In this paper, we described a practical method for transforming free-text clinical research eligibility criteria of Alzheimer's clinical trials into a structured relational database compliant with standards for medical terminologies and clinical data models. We utilized a hybrid natural language processing system and a concept normalization tool to extract medical terms in clinical research eligibility criteria and represent them using the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) v5. We created a database schema design to store syntactic relations to facilitate efficient cohort queries. We further discussed the potential of applying this method to trials on other diseases and the promise of using it to accelerate clinical research with electronic health records.",

        "Abstract": "Tacrolimus (FK506) and cyclosporine A (CsA) are widely used to protect graft function after renal transplantation. The aim of the present study is to determine whether the single nucleotide polymorphism of CYP3A5 is a predictive index of FK506 dose requirement, and also the selection yardstick of FK506 or CsA treatment.We tested archival peripheral blood of 218 kidney recipients for CYP3A5 genotyping with PCR-SSP. Meanwhile, the dose of FK506 and CsA was recorded, blood concentration of the drugs was measured, and graft outcome was monitored.These results indicate that CYP3A5*AA/AG carriers need higher FK506 dose than CYP3A5*GG homozygote to achieve the target blood concentration. For CYP3A5*GG carriers, taking FK506 or CsA are both advisable. CYP3A5*AA/AG carriers preferred to CsA treatment depending on the graft outcomes and drug costs. CYP3A5 genotyping is a new approach to detecting FK506 dose requirement and a predictive index for the FK506 or CsA treatment selection in kidney recipients.",

        "Abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that information extraction of unstructured clinical notes using natural language processing (NLP) and text mining is essential for secondary use of clinical data for clinical research and practice. Lab test results are currently structured in most of the electronic health record (EHR) systems. However, for referral patients or lab tests that can be done in non-clinical setting, the results can be captured in unstructured clinical notes. In this study, we proposed a rule-based information extraction system to extract the lab test results with temporal information from clinical notes. The lab test results of glucose and HbA1c from 104 randomly sampled diabetes patients selected from 1996 to 2015 are extracted and further correlated with structured lab test information in the Mayo Clinic EHRs. The system has high F1-scores of 0.964, 0.967 and 0.966 in glucose, HbA1c and overall extraction, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Cohort identification for clinical studies tends to be laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Developing automated or semi-automated methods for cohort identification is one of the \"holy grails\" in the field of biomedical informatics. We propose a high-throughput similarity-based cohort identification algorithm by applying numerical abstractions on Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. We implement this algorithm using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), which enables sites using this standardized EHR data representation to avail this algorithm with minimum effort for local implementation. We validate its performance for a retrospective cohort identification task on six clinical trials conducted at the Columbia University Medical Center. Our algorithm achieves an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.966 and an average Precision at 5 of 0.983. This interoperable method promises to achieve efficient cohort identification in EHR databases. We discuss suitable applications of our method and its limitations and propose warranted future work.",

        "Title": "Evaluation of crescent formation as a predictive marker in immunoglobulin A nephropathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "Abstract": "The 2009 Oxford Classification of immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) identifies four histological features as predictors of renal prognosis: mesangial hypercellularity (M), endocapillary hypercellularity (E), segmental glomerulosclerosis (S), and tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis (T). However, the clinical and prognostic significance of crescent formation still remains controversial. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between crescents and kidney outcome in IgAN. A total of 20 studies published from January 2009 to July 2016 involving 5,285 patients were included after systematic searches of PubMed and EMBASE databases. Pooled results showed that crescent lesions were associated with kidney failure (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.49-2.50; P < 0.001). IgAN patients with crescents had lower eGFR levels (SMD, -0.21; 95% CI, -0.40--0.03; P = 0.023); higher proteinuria levels (SMD, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.11-1.63; P = 0.024); a larger number of patients with M1 (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.07-1.40; P = 0.003), E1 (RR, 4.83; 95% CI, 3.04-7.66;P < 0.001), S1 (RR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11-2.80; P = 0.016) and T1/2 (RR, 2.74; 95% CI, 2.10-3.57; P < 0.001) lesions; and received immunosuppressive therapy more frequently (RD, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.11-0.23; P < 0.001). Our results suggest that crescent formation represents an efficient prognostic factor associated with progression to kidney failure and thus could be considered into the new Oxford Classification.",

We propose a statistical method to estimate the optimal individualized treatment rules (ITRs) that are tailored according to subject-specific features using electronic health records (EHR) data. Our approach merges statistical modeling and medical domain knowledge with machine learning algorithms to assist personalized medical decision making using EHR. We transform the estimation of optimal ITR into a classification problem and account for the non-experimental features of the EHR data and confounding by clinical indication. We create a broad range of feature variables that reflect both patient health status and healthcare data collection process. Using EHR data collected at Columbia University clinical data warehouse, we construct a decision tree for choosing the best second line therapy for treating type 2 diabetes patients.",

Using expert-based and data-driven methods we assessed SH among HIV-associated data elements (DEs). Using Clinicaltrials.gov, we identified and obtained eight data dictionaries, and created a DE inventory. We vectorized DEs by study, and developed a new method, String Metric-assisted Assessment of Semantic Heterogeneity (SMASH), to find DEs: similar in A",

We propose a multi-trait metric - GIST 2.0 that can compute the a priori generalizability based on the population representativeness of a clinical study by explicitly modeling the dependencies among all eligibility criteria. We evaluate this metric on twenty clinical studies of two diseases and analyze how a study's eligibility criteria affect its generalizability (collectively and individually). We statistically analyze the effects of trial setting, trait selection and trait summarizing technique on GIST 2.0. Finally we provide theoretical as well as empirical validations for the expected properties of GIST 2.0.",

To infer such relations, we partition the extracted concepts and group them into closely-related clusters using Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, informed by syntactic matching and semantic relatedness functions. We introduce a novel, unsupervised method for cluster detection based on automated dendrogram pruning, which is dynamic to each partition. We evaluate our approach with two different types of textual corpora, clinical trials descriptions and MEDLINE publication abstracts. The results of several experiments indicate that our method is superior to existing dynamic pruning and the state-of-art taxonomy learning methods. It yields higher concept coverage (95.75%) and higher accuracy of learned taxonomic relations (up to 0.71 average precision and 0.96 average recall).",

In this paper, we present a quantitative metric called generalizability index for study traits 2.0 (GIST 2.0) to assess the a priori generalizability (based on population representativeness) of a clinical trial by accounting for the dependencies among multiple eligibility criteria. The metric was evaluated on 16 sepsis trials identified from ClinicalTrials.gov, with their adverse event reports extracted from the trial results sections. The correlation between GIST scores and adverse events was analyzed. We found that the GIST 2.0 score was significantly correlated with total adverse events and serious adverse events (weighted correlation coefficients of 0.825 and 0.709, respectively, with P < 0.01). This study exemplifies the promising use of Big Data in electronic health records and ClinicalTrials.gov for optimizing eligibility criteria design for clinical studies.",

        "Abstract": "Podocyte injury and the appearance of proteinuria are features of minimal-change disease (MCD). Cyclosporin A (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506) has been reported to reduce proteinuria in patients with nephrotic syndrome, but mechanisms remain unknown. We, therefore, investigated the protective mechanisms of CsA and FK506 on proteinuria in a rat model of MCD induced by puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) and in vitro cultured mouse podocytes. Our results showed that CsA and FK506 treatment decreased proteinuria via a mechanism associated to a reduction in the foot-process fusion and desmin, and a recovery of synaptopodin and podocin. In PAN-treated mouse podocytes, pre-incubation with CsA and FK506 restored the distribution of the actin cytoskeleton, increased the expression of synaptopodin and podocin, improved podocyte viability, and reduced the migrating activities of podocytes. Treatment with CsA and FK506 also inhibited PAN-induced podocytes apoptosis, which was associated with the induction of Bcl-xL and inhibition of Bax, cleaved caspase 3, and cleaved PARP expression. Further studies revealed that CsA and FK506 inhibited PAN-induced p38 and JNK signaling, thereby protecting podocytes from PAN-induced injury. In conclusion, CsA and FK506 inhibit proteinuria by protecting against PAN-induced podocyte injury, which may be associated with inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge reuse of cancer trial designs may benefit from a temporal understanding of the evolution of the target populations of cancer studies over time. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the trends of cancer trial eligibility criteria between 1999 and 2014. The yearly distributions of eligibility concepts for chemicals and drugs, procedures, observations, and medical conditions extracted from free-text eligibility criteria of 32,000 clinical trials for 89 cancer types were analyzed. We identified the concepts that trend upwards or downwards in all or selected cancer types, and the concepts that show anomalous trends for some cancers. Later, concept trends were studied in a disease-specific manner and illustrated for breast cancer. Criteria trends observed in this study are also validated and interpreted using evidence from the existing medical literature. This study contributes a method for concept trend analysis and original knowledge of the trends in cancer clinical trial eligibility criteria.",

        "Title": "NMDA receptors participate in the progression of diabetic kidney disease by decreasing Cdc42-GTP activation in podocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Podocytes play important roles in the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and these roles are closely associated with cytoskeletal actin dynamics. N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which consist of two functional NR1 subunits and two regulatory NR2 subunits, are widely expressed in the brain but are also found in podocytes. Here, we found increased NR1 expression in two diabetic mouse models and in podocytes incubated in high glucose (HG). In diabetic mice, knockdown of NR1 using lentivirus carrying NR1-shRNA ameliorated the pathological features associated with DKD, and reversed the decreased expression of synaptopodin and Wilms' tumour-1. In podocytes incubated with HG, NR1 was secreted from the endoplasmic reticulum and this was blocked by bisindolylmaleimide I. NR1 knockdown decreased the cell shape remodelling, cell collapse, bovine serum albumin permeability, and migration induced by HG. After HG incubation, levels of cell division control protein 42 (Cdc42) and its active form increased, and a significantly higher Cdc42-GTP level, increased Cdc42 translocation onto the leading edges, and lower migration ability were found in podocytes with NR1 knockdown. Increases in the number and length of filopodia were found in podocytes with NR1 knockdown but these were abolished by Cdc42-GTP blockade with ML141. In conclusion, the activation of NMDARs plays an important role in DKD by reducing Cdc42-GTP activation. Copyright \u00a9 2016 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

        "Abstract": "The worldwide adoption of electronic health records (EHR) promises to accelerate clinical research, which lies at the heart of medical advances. However, the interrogation of such Big Data by clinical researchers can be laborious and error-prone, involving iterative and ineffective communication of data requests to data analysts. Research on this communication process is rare. There also exists no contemporary system that offers intelligent solutions to assist clinical researchers in their quest for clinical data. In this article, we first provide a detailed characterization of the challenges encountered in this communication space. Second, we identify promising synergies between fields studying human-to-human and human-machine communication that can shed light on biomedical data query mediation. We propose a mixed-initiative dialog-based approach to support autonomous clinical data access and recommend needed technology development and communication study for accelerating clinical research.",

        "Title": "Facilitating biomedical researchers' interrogation of electronic health record data: Ideas from outside of biomedical informatics.",
        "Abstract": "Electronic health records (EHR) are a vital data resource for research uses, including cohort identification, phenotyping, pharmacovigilance, and public health surveillance. To realize the promise of EHR data for accelerating clinical research, it is imperative to enable efficient and autonomous EHR data interrogation by end users such as biomedical researchers. This paper surveys state-of-art approaches and key methodological considerations to this purpose. We adapted a previously published conceptual framework for interactive information retrieval, which defines three entities: user, channel, and source, by elaborating on channels for query formulation in the context of facilitating end users to interrogate EHR data. We show the current progress in biomedical informatics mainly lies in support for query execution and information modeling, primarily due to emphases on infrastructure development for data integration and data access via self-service query tools, but has neglected user support needed during iteratively query formulation processes, which can be costly and error-prone. In contrast, the information science literature has offered elaborate theories and methods for user modeling and query formulation support. The two bodies of literature are complementary, implying opportunities for cross-disciplinary idea exchange. On this basis, we outline the directions for future informatics research to improve our understanding of user needs and requirements for facilitating autonomous interrogation of EHR data by biomedical researchers. We suggest that cross-disciplinary translational research between biomedical informatics and information science can benefit our research in facilitating efficient data access in life sciences.",

        "Abstract": "Precision medicine requires precise evidence-based practice and precise definition of the patients included in clinical studies for evidence generalization. Clinical research exclusion criteria define confounder patient characteristics for exclusion from a study. However, unnecessary exclusion criteria can weaken patient representativeness of study designs and generalizability of study results. This paper presents a method for identifying questionable exclusion criteria for 38 mental disorders. We extracted common eligibility features (CEFs) from all trials on these disorders from ClinicalTrials.gov. Network Analysis showed scale-free property of the CEF network, indicating uneven usage frequencies among CEFs. By comparing these CEFs' term frequencies in clinical trials' exclusion criteria and in the PubMed Medical Encyclopedia for matching conditions, we identified unjustified potential overuse of exclusion CEFs in mental disorder trials. Then we discussed the limitations in current exclusion criteria designs and made recommendations for achieving more patient-centered exclusion criteria definitions.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical data access involves complex but opaque communication between medical researchers and query analysts. Understanding such communication is indispensable for designing intelligent human-machine dialog systems that automate query formulation. This study investigates email communication and proposes a novel scheme for classifying dialog acts in clinical research query mediation. We analyzed 315 email messages exchanged in the communication for 20 data requests obtained from three institutions. The messages were segmented into 1333 utterance units. Through a rigorous process, we developed a classification scheme and applied it for dialog act annotation of the extracted utterances. Evaluation results with high inter-annotator agreement demonstrate the reliability of this scheme. This dataset is used to contribute preliminary understanding of dialog acts distribution and conversation flow in this dialog space.",

        "Abstract": "Genomic medicine has the potential to improve care by tailoring treatments to the individual. There is consensus in the literature that pharmacogenomics (PGx) may be an ideal starting point for real-world implementation, due to the presence of well-characterized drug-gene interactions. Clinical Decision Support (CDS) is an ideal avenue by which to implement PGx at the bedside. Previous literature has established theoretical models for PGx CDS implementation and discussed a number of anticipated real-world challenges. However, work detailing actual PGx CDS implementation experiences has been limited. Anticipated challenges include data storage and management, system integration, physician acceptance, and more.",

        "Abstract": "Drug discovery is costly and time-consuming. Efficient drug repurposing promises to accelerate drug discovery with reduced cost. However, most successful repurposing cases so far have been achieved by serendipity. There is a need for more efficient computational methods for predicting new indications for existing drugs. This paper conducts a retrospective analysis of the temporal patterns of drug intervention trials for every drug in a pair of different conditions in ClinicalTrials.gov, including 550 drugs used for 451 conditions between 2003 and 2013. We found that drugs are often targeted towards conditions that are related by similar or identical eligibility criteria. We demonstrated the preliminary feasibility of predicting new target conditions for drug retesting among conditions with similar aggregated clinical trial eligibility criteria and confirmed this hypothesis using evidence from the literature.",

The primary innovation of RedX was the electronic health record view of patient data, to provide better contextual understanding for non-technical users in building complex data queries. The design of RedX around this need identified multiple functions that would use individual patient views to better understand population-based data, and vice-versa. During development, the more necessary and valuable components of RedX were refined, leading to a functional self-service query and cohort identification tool. However, with the improved capabilities and extensibility of other applications for data querying and navigation, our long-term implementation and dissemination plans have moved towards consolidation and alignment of RedX functions as enhancements in these other initiatives.",

        "Abstract": "Randomized controlled trials generate high-quality medical evidence. However, the use of unjustified inclusion/exclusion criteria may compromise the external validity of a study. We have introduced a method to assess the population representativeness of related clinical trials using electronic health record (EHR) data. As EHR data may not perfectly represent the real-world patient population, in this work, we further validated the method and its results using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. We visualized and quantified the differences in the distributions of age, HbA1c, and BMI among the target population of Type 2 diabetes trials, diabetics in NHANES databases, and a convenience sample of patients enrolled in selected Type 2 diabetes trials. The results are consistent with the previous study.",

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and its metastasis accounts for the majority of deaths. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC progression are not well characterized. In this study, we identified miR-409-3p as a tumor suppressor of CRC. MiR-409-3p expression was significantly downregulated in CRC tissue compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue, and reduced miR-409-3p expression was correlated with CRC metastasis. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that miR-409-3p negatively regulated CRC metastatic capacities, including suppressing cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis. To explore the mechanism of action of miR-409-3p, we adopted a pathway and pathophysiological event-based target screening and validation approach, and found nine known metastasis-related genes as potential targets. The 3'-UTR binding assays between the candidates and miR-409-3p suggested that only GAB1, NR4A2 and LMO4 were directly regulated by the miRNA. However, endogenous expression analysis revealed that only GAB1 was modulated by miR-409-3p in CRC cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we provided evidence to conclude that GAB1 was partially responsible for miR-409-3p-mediated metastasis. Taken together, our data demonstrate that miR-409-3p is a metastatic suppressor, and post-transcriptional inhibition of the oncoprotein GAB1 is one of the mechanisms of action of this miRNA. Our finding suggests miR-409-3p might be a novel target for CRC metastasis treatment.",

We compared the summary statistics between clinical and research datasets. Seven clinical variables, i.e., height, weight, gender, ethnicity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and diabetes status, were included in the study. Our results show that the clinical data and research data had similar summary statistical profiles, but there are detectable differences in definitions and measurements for individual variables such as height, diastolic blood pressure, and diabetes status.

We randomly selected thirty interventional breast cancer clinical trials conducted at The New York-Presbyterian Hospital on the Columbia University Medical Center campus to create training (N=20) and testing (N=10) datasets. We utilized the Think-aloud protocol to gauge how clinical researchers identify and use major eligibility criteria to prescreen patients for clinical trials during an audio-recorded interview. A focus group session was held to understand the current prescreening process and investigate how it could be optimized to maximize recruitment rates. Using the grounded theory method, we annotated transcriptions to discover user rationale and desiderata behind major eligibility criteria in breast cancer clinical trials, which were later evaluated in a follow-up survey.",

Readability of eligibility criteria was assessed according to (i) shallow and lexical characteristics through the use of an established, generic readability metric; (ii) syntactic characteristics through natural language processing techniques; and (iii) health terminological characteristics through an automated comparison to technical and lay health texts. We further stratified clinical trials according to various study characteristics (e.g., source country or study type) to understand potential factors influencing readability. Mainly caused by frequent use of technical jargons, a college reading level was found to be necessary to understand eligibility criteria text, a level much higher than the average literacy level of the general American population. The use of technical jargons should be minimized to simplify eligibility criteria text.",

        "Abstract": "Domain-specific common data elements (CDEs) are emerging as an effective approach to standards-based clinical research data storage and retrieval. A limiting factor, however, is the lack of robust automated quality assurance (QA) tools for the CDEs in clinical study domains. The objectives of the present study are to prototype and evaluate a QA tool for the study of cancer CDEs using a post-coordination approach. The study starts by integrating the NCI caDSR CDEs and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data dictionaries in a single Resource Description Framework (RDF) data store. We designed a compositional expression pattern based on the Data Element Concept model structure informed by ISO/IEC 11179, and developed a transformation tool that converts the pattern-based compositional expressions into the Web Ontology Language (OWL) syntax. Invoking reasoning and explanation services, we tested the system utilizing the CDEs extracted from two TCGA clinical cancer study domains. The system could automatically identify duplicate CDEs, and detect CDE modeling errors. In conclusion, compositional expressions not only enable reuse of existing ontology codes to define new domain concepts, but also provide an automated mechanism for QA of terminological annotations for CDEs.",

        "Abstract": "The Generalizability Index for Study Traits (GIST) has been proposed recently for assessing the population representativeness of a set of related clinical trials using eligibility features (e.g., age or BMI), one each time. However, GIST has not yet been evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this paper reports a simulation-based validation study for GIST. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, we demonstrated the effectiveness of GIST at quantifying the population representativeness of a set of related trials that differ in disease domains, study phases, sponsor types, and study designs, respectively. We also showed that among seven example medical conditions, the GIST of age increases from Phase I trials to Phase III trials in the seven disease domains and is the lowest in asthma trials. We concluded that GIST correlates with simulation-based generalizability results and is a valid metric for quantifying population representativeness of related clinical trials.",

This study tests a similarity-based approach to recommending concepts from a text corpus to a terminology. Our approach involves extraction of candidate concepts from a given text corpus, which are represented using a set of features. The model learns the important features to characterize a concept and recommends new concepts to a terminology. Further, we propose a cost-effective evaluation methodology to estimate the effectiveness of terminology enrichment methods. To test our methodology, we use the clinical trial eligibility criteria free-text as an example text corpus to recommend concepts for SNOMED CT. We computed precision at various rank intervals to measure the performance of the methods. Results indicate that our automated algorithm is an effective method for concept recommendation.",

It is a valuable but relatively untapped resource for understanding trial design patterns and acquiring reusable trial design knowledge. We extracted common eligibility features using an unsupervised tag-mining method and mined their temporal usage patterns in clinical trials on various cancers. We then employed trend and network analysis to investigate two questions: (1) what eligibility features are frequently used to select patients for clinical trials within one cancer or across multiple cancers; and (2) what are the trends in eligibility feature adoption or discontinuation across cancer research domains? Our results showed that each cancer domain reuses a small set of eligibility features frequently for selecting cancer trial patients and some features are shared across different cancers, with value range adjustments for numerical measures. We discuss the implications for facilitating community-based clinical research knowledge sharing and reuse.",

Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to improve the efficiency of such translation. However, it is laborious to develop NLP to structure free-text CPGs using existing formal knowledge representations (KR). In response to this challenge, this vision paper discusses the value and feasibility of supporting symbiosis in text-based knowledge acquisition (KA) and KR. We compare two ontologies: (1) an ontology manually created by domain experts for CPG eligibility criteria and (2) an upper-level ontology derived from a semantic pattern-based approach for automatic KA from CPG eligibility criteria text. Then we discuss the strengths and limitations of interweaving KA and NLP for KR purposes and important considerations for achieving the symbiosis of KR and NLP for structuring CPGs to achieve evidence-based clinical practice.",

In the past, however, little attention has been paid to whether poor data quality merely introduces noise into EHR-derived datasets, or if there is potential for the creation of spurious signals and bias. In this study we use EHR data to demonstrate a statistically significant relationship between EHR completeness and patient health status, indicating that records with more data are likely to be more representative of sick patients than healthy ones, and therefore may not reflect the broader population found within the EHR.",

        "Abstract": "With antimicrobial resistance increasing worldwide, there is a great need to use automated antimicrobial decision support systems (ADSSs) to lower antimicrobial resistance rates by promoting appropriate antimicrobial use. However, they are infrequently used mostly because of their poor interoperability with different health information technologies. Ontologies can augment portable ADSSs by providing an explicit knowledge representation for biomedical entities and their relationships, helping to standardize and integrate heterogeneous data resources. We developed a bacterial clinical infectious diseases ontology (BCIDO) using Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-OWL. BCIDO defines a controlled terminology for clinical infectious diseases along with domain knowledge commonly used in hospital settings for clinical infectious disease treatment decision-making. BCIDO has 599 classes and 2355 object properties. Terms were imported from or mapped to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine, Unified Medical Language System, RxNorm and National Center for Bitechnology Information Organismal Classification where possible. Domain expert evaluation using the \"laddering\" technique, ontology visualization, and clinical notes and scenarios, confirmed the correctness and potential usefulness of BCIDO.",

Various clinical trial search engines have been designed to help health consumers identify trials for which they may be eligible. Unfortunately, knowledge of the usefulness and usability of their designs remains scarce. In this study, we used mixed methods, including time-motion analysis, think-aloud protocol, and survey, to evaluate five popular clinical trial search engines with 11 users. Differences in user preferences and time spent on each system were observed and correlated with user characteristics. In general, searching for applicable trials using these systems is a cognitively demanding task. Our results show that user perceptions of these systems are multifactorial. The survey indicated eTACTS being the generally preferred system, but this finding did not persist among all mixed methods. This study confirms the value of mixed-methods for a comprehensive system evaluation. Future system designers must be aware that different users groups expect different functionalities.",

However, understanding of the BQM process is limited in the literature. To bridge this gap, we performed the initial steps of a cognitive task analysis using 31 BQM instances conducted between one analyst and 22 researchers in one academic department. We identified five top-level tasks, i.e., clarify research statement, explain clinical process, identify related data elements, locate EHR data element, and end BQM with either a database query or unmet, infeasible information needs, and 10 sub-tasks. We evaluated the BQM task model with seven data analysts from different clinical research institutions. Evaluators found all the tasks completely or semi-valid. This study contributes initial knowledge towards the development of a generalizable cognitive task representation for BQM.",

We installed a free usage logging service, Google Analytics, on CUSP and applied time series analysis to compare the usage patterns of the two modes of CUSP: restricted (authenticated) and open access. More users searched by person names than by topics, although the latter enables in-depth vertical search of co-author or co-investigator networks for grants or publications. The open-access mode received more page views but less average time spent on each page than the restricted access mode. The numbers of unique users and searches have increased over the time. This study contributes a trend analysis framework for understanding the usage of RNSs and early knowledge of the usage of an open-access RNS.",

        "Abstract": "User needs understanding is critical for developing useful and usable clinical research decision support. Existing methods largely depend on self-reporting and often fail to elicit implicit or fine-grained user needs. We hypothesized that functional software would address this problem by presenting to users existing technology while simultaneously encouraging users to optimize workflow. Using clinical research visit scheduling as an example, we used a piece of software under development that was called IMPACT to reveal user needs iteratively. The identified user needs explained why most clinical research coordinators still rely on paper to schedule clinical research visits. The common user needs themes such as information completeness for software to be useful may generalize to other clinical decision support. This paper contributes valuable firsthand knowledge about user needs for decision support for clinical research visit scheduling among clinical research coordinators and a generalizable methodology for collecting and analyzing software usage data to inform user needs elicitation.",

        "Abstract": "The \"Learning Health System\" has been described as an environment that drives research and innovation as a natural outgrowth of patient care. Electronic health records (EHRs) are necessary to enable the Learning Health System; however, a source of frustration is that current systems fail to adequately support research needs. We propose a model for enhancing EHRs to collect structured and standards-based clinical research data during clinical encounters that promotes efficiency and computational reuse of quality data for both care and research. The model integrates Common Data Elements (CDEs) for clinical research into existing clinical documentation workflows, leveraging executable documentation guidance within the EHR to support coordinated, standardized data collection for both patient care and clinical research.",

        "Abstract": "ClinicalTrials.gov presents great opportunities for analyzing commonalities in clinical trial target populations to facilitate knowledge reuse when designing eligibility criteria of future trials or to reveal potential systematic biases in selecting population subgroups for clinical research. Towards this goal, this paper presents a novel data resource for enabling such analyses. Our method includes two parts: (1) parsing and indexing eligibility criteria text; and (2) mining common eligibility features and attributes of common numeric features (e.g., A1c). We designed and built a database called \"Commonalities in Target Populations of Clinical Trials\" (COMPACT), which stores structured eligibility criteria and trial metadata in a readily computable format. We illustrate its use in an example analytic module called CONECT using COMPACT as the backend. Type 2 diabetes is used as an example to analyze commonalities in the target populations of 4,493 clinical trials on this disease.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) have been used as a valuable data source for phenotyping. However, this method suffers from inherent data quality issues like data missingness. As patient self-reported health data are increasingly available, it is useful to know how the two data sources compare with each other for phenotyping. This study addresses this research question. We used self-reported diabetes status for 2,249 patients treated at Columbia University Medical Center and the well-known eMERGE EHR phenotyping algorithm for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) to conduct the experiment. The eMERGE algorithm achieved high specificity (.97) but low sensitivity (.32) among this patient cohort. About 87% of the patients with self-reported diabetes had at least one ICD-9 code, one medication, or one lab result supporting a DM2 diagnosis, implying the remaining 13% may have missing or incorrect self-reports. We discuss the tradeoffs in both data sources and in combining them for phenotyping.",

CKD is frequently undiagnosed and patients are unaware, hampering intervention. A tool for accurate and timely identification of CKD from electronic medical records (EMR) could improve healthcare quality and identify patients for research. As members of eMERGE (electronic medical records and genomics) Network, we developed an automated phenotyping algorithm that can be deployed to identify rapidly diabetic and/or hypertensive CKD cases and controls in health systems with EMRs It uses diagnostic codes, laboratory results, medication and blood pressure records, and textual information culled from notes. Validation statistics demonstrated positive predictive values of 96% and negative predictive values of 93.3. Similar results were obtained on implementation by two independent eMERGE member institutions. The algorithm dramatically outperformed identification by ICD-9-CM codes with 63% positive and 54% negative predictive values, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Many academic medical centers have aggregated data from multiple clinical systems into centralized repositories. These repositories can then be queried by skilled data analysts who act as intermediaries between the data stores and the research teams. To obtain data, researchers are often expected to complete a data request form. Such forms are meant to support record-keeping and, most importantly, provide a means for conveying complex data needs in a clear and understandable manner. Yet little is known about how data request forms are constructed and how effective they are likely to be. We conducted a content analysis of ten data request forms from CTSA-supported institutions. We found that most of the forms over-emphasized the collection of metadata that were not considered germane to the actual data needs. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to improve the quality of data request forms in support of clinical and translational research.",

        "Abstract": "Underspecified user needs and frequent lack of a gold standard reference are typical barriers to technology evaluation. To address this problem, this paper presents a two-phase evaluation framework involving usability experts (phase 1) and end-users (phase 2). In phase 1, a cross-system functionality alignment between expert-derived user needs and system functions was performed to inform the choice of \"the best available\" comparison system to enable a cognitive walkthrough in phase 1 and a comparative effectiveness evaluation in phase 2. During phase 2, five quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods are mixed to assess usability: time-motion analysis, software log, questionnaires - System Usability Scale and the Unified Theory of Acceptance of Use of Technology, think-aloud protocols, and unstructured interviews. Each method contributes data for a unique measure (e.g., time motion analysis contributes task-completion-time; software log contributes action transition frequency). The measures are triangulated to yield complementary insights regarding user-perceived ease-of-use, functionality integration, anxiety during use, and workflow impact. To illustrate its use, we applied this framework in a formative evaluation of a software called Integrated Model for Patient Care and Clinical Trials (IMPACT). We conclude that this mixed-methods evaluation framework enables an integrated assessment of user needs satisfaction and user-perceived usefulness and usability of a novel design. This evaluation framework effectively bridges the gap between co-evolving user needs and technology designs during iterative prototyping and is particularly useful when it is difficult for users to articulate their needs for technology support due to the lack of a baseline.",

        "Abstract": "Developing electronic health record (EHR) phenotyping algorithms involves generating queries that run across the EHR data repository. Algorithms are commonly assessed within demonstration studies. There remains, however, little emphasis on assessing the precision and accuracy of measurement methods during the evaluation process. Depending on the complexity of an algorithm, interim refinements may be required to improve measurement methods. Therefore, we develop an evaluation framework that incorporates both measurement and demonstration studies. We evaluate a baseline EHR phenotyping algorithm for drug induced liver injury (DILI) developed in collaboration with electronic Medical Records Genomics (eMERGE) network participants. We conduct a measurement study and report qualitative (i.e., perceptions of evaluation approach effectiveness) and quantitative (i.e., inter-rater reliability) measures. We also conduct a demonstration study and report qualitative (i.e., appropriateness of results) and quantitative (i.e., positive predictive value) measures. Given results from the measurement study, our evaluation approach underwent multiple changes including the addition of laboratory value visualization and an expanded review of clinical notes. Results from the demonstration study informed changes to our algorithm. For example, given the goal of eMERGE to identify patients who may have a genetic susceptibility to DILI, we excluded overdose patients.",

We present a framework to dynamically refine clinical trial search results towards a manually reviewable number of studies. At this aim, a set of frequent features are extracted automatically offline from the eligibility criteria of a representative subset of clinical trials. These features are then presented dynamically to the users based on feature co-occurrences and user interactions to reduce the number of resulting documents. Experiments on ClinicalTrials.gov showed that using an average of four features, it is feasible to reduce the results of a simple search from over a thousand to ten.",

However, this approach does not scale up and is time-consuming and expensive. We analyzed query mediation dialogues to inform future designs of intelligent query mediation systems. Thirty-one mediated query sessions for 22 research projects were recorded and transcribed. We analyzed 10 of these to develop an annotation schema for dialogue acts through iterative refinement. Three coders independently annotated all 3160 dialogue acts. We assessed the inter-rater agreement and resolved disagreement by group consensus. This study contributes early knowledge of the query negotiation space for medical research. We conclude that research data query formulation is not a straightforward translation from researcher data needs to database queries, but rather iterative, process-oriented needs assessment and refinement.",

This paper proposes a novel methodology to derive a semantic index for clinical eligibility documents based on a controlled vocabulary of frequent tags, which are automatically mined from the text. We applied this method to eligibility criteria on ClinicalTrials.gov and report that frequent tags (1) define an effective and efficient index of clinical trials and (2) are unlikely to grow radically when the repository increases. We proposed to apply the semantic index to filter clinical trial search results and we concluded that frequent tags reduce the result space more efficiently than an uncontrolled set of UMLS concepts. Overall, unsupervised mining of frequent tags from clinical text leads to an effective semantic index for the clinical eligibility documents and promotes their computational reuse.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical trial eligibility criteria define fine-grained characteristics of research volunteers for various disease trials and hence are a promising data source for disease profiling. This paper explores the feasibility of using disease-specific common eligibility features (CEFs) for representing diseases and understanding their relatedness. We extracted disease-specific CEFs from eligibility criteria on ClinicalTrials.gov for three illustrative categories - cancers, mental disorders and chronic diseases - each including seven diseases. We then constructed disease-specific CEF networks to assess the degree of overlap among the diseases. Using these automatically derived networks, we observed several findings that were confirmed in medicine. For example, we highlighted connections among schizophrenia, epilepsy and depression. We also identified a link between Crohn's disease and arthritis. These observations confirm the value of using clinical trial eligibility criteria for identifying disease relatedness. We further discuss the implications of CEFs for standardizing clinical trial eligibility criteria through reuse.",

        "Abstract": "We demonstrate the importance of explicit definitions of electronic health record (EHR) data completeness and how different conceptualizations of completeness may impact findings from EHR-derived datasets. This study has important repercussions for researchers and clinicians engaged in the secondary use of EHR data. We describe four prototypical definitions of EHR completeness: documentation, breadth, density, and predictive completeness. Each definition dictates a different approach to the measurement of completeness. These measures were applied to representative data from NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital's clinical data warehouse. We found that according to any definition, the number of complete records in our clinical database is far lower than the nominal total. The proportion that meets criteria for completeness is heavily dependent on the definition of completeness used, and the different definitions generate different subsets of records. We conclude that the concept of completeness in EHR is contextual. We urge data consumers to be explicit in how they define a complete record and transparent about the limitations of their data.",

Now in its sixth year and second funding cycle, and comprising nine research groups and a coordinating center, the network has played a major role in validating the concept that clinical data derived from electronic medical records can be used successfully for genomic research. Current work is advancing knowledge in multiple disciplines at the intersection of genomics and health-care informatics, particularly for electronic phenotyping, genome-wide association studies, genomic medicine implementation, and the ethical and regulatory issues associated with genomics research and returning results to study participants. Here, we describe the evolution, accomplishments, opportunities, and challenges of the network from its inception as a five-group consortium focused on genotype-phenotype associations for genomic discovery to its current form as a nine-group consortium pivoting toward the implementation of genomic medicine.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a clinical research visit scheduling system that can potentially coordinate clinical research visits with patient care visits and increase efficiency at clinical sites where clinical and research activities occur simultaneously. Participatory Design methods were applied to support requirements engineering and to create this software called Integrated Model for Patient Care and Clinical Trials (IMPACT). Using a multi-user constraint satisfaction and resource optimization algorithm, IMPACT automatically synthesizes temporal availability of various research resources and recommends the optimal dates and times for pending research visits. We conducted scenario-based evaluations with 10 clinical research coordinators (CRCs) from diverse clinical research settings to assess the usefulness, feasibility, and user acceptance of IMPACT. We obtained qualitative feedback using semi-structured interviews with the CRCs. Most CRCs acknowledged the usefulness of IMPACT features. Support for collaboration within research teams and interoperability with electronic health records and clinical trial management systems were highly requested features. Overall, IMPACT received satisfactory user acceptance and proves to be potentially useful for a variety of clinical research settings. Our future work includes comparing the effectiveness of IMPACT with that of existing scheduling solutions on the market and conducting field tests to formally assess user adoption.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes our considerations and methods for implementing an open-source centralized research data repository (CRDR) and reports its impact on retrospective outcomes research capacity in the urology department at Columbia University. We performed retrospective pretest and post-test analyses of user acceptance, workflow efficiency, and publication quantity and quality (measured by journal impact factor) before and after the implementation. The CRDR transformed the research workflow and enabled a new research model. During the pre- and post-test periods, the department's average annual retrospective study publication rate was 11.5 and 25.6, respectively; the average publication impact score was 1.7 and 3.1, respectively. The new model was adopted by 62.5% (5/8) of the clinical scientists within the department. Additionally, four basic science researchers outside the department took advantage of the implemented model. The average proximate time required to complete a retrospective study decreased from 12 months before the implementation to <6 months after the implementation. Implementing a CRDR appears to be effective in enhancing the outcomes research capacity for one academic department.",

This study contributes a method for evaluating RNSs and initial usage knowledge of one RNS obtained from using this method. We designed a log for an institutional RNS, defined categories of users and tasks, and analyzed correlations between usage patterns and user and query types. Our results show that scientific professionals spend more time performing deep Web searching on RNSs than generic Google users and we also show that retrieving scientist profiles is faster on an RNS than on Google (3.5 seconds vs. 34.2 seconds) whereas organization-specific browsing on a RNS takes longer than on Google (117.0 seconds vs. 34.2 seconds). Usage patterns vary by user role, e.g., faculty performed more informational queries than administrators, which implies role-specific user support is needed for RNSs.",

        "Abstract": "Effective clinical text processing requires accurate extraction and representation of temporal expressions. Multiple temporal information extraction models were developed but a similar need for extracting temporal expressions in eligibility criteria (e.g., for eligibility determination) remains. We identified the temporal knowledge representation requirements of eligibility criteria by reviewing 100 temporal criteria. We developed EliXR-TIME, a frame-based representation designed to support semantic annotation for temporal expressions in eligibility criteria by reusing applicable classes from well-known clinical temporal knowledge representations. We used EliXR-TIME to analyze a training set of 50 new temporal eligibility criteria. We evaluated EliXR-TIME using an additional random sample of 20 eligibility criteria with temporal expressions that have no overlap with the training data, yielding 92.7% (76 / 82) inter-coder agreement on sentence chunking and 72% (72 / 100) agreement on semantic annotation. We conclude that this knowledge representation can facilitate semantic annotation of the temporal expressions in eligibility criteria.",

        "Title": "Using EHRs to integrate research with patient care: promises and challenges.",
        "Abstract": "Clinical research is the foundation for advancing the practice of medicine. However, the lack of seamless integration between clinical research and patient care workflow impedes recruitment efficiency, escalates research costs, and hence threatens the entire clinical research enterprise. Increased use of electronic health records (EHRs) holds promise for facilitating this integration but must surmount regulatory obstacles. Among the unintended consequences of current research oversight are barriers to accessing patient information for prescreening and recruitment, coordinating scheduling of clinical and research visits, and reconciling information about clinical and research drugs. We conclude that the EHR alone cannot overcome barriers in conducting clinical trials and comparative effectiveness research. Patient privacy and human subject protection policies should be clarified at the local level to exploit optimally the full potential of EHRs, while continuing to ensure participant safety. Increased alignment of policies that regulate the clinical and research use of EHRs could help fulfill the vision of more efficiently obtaining clinical research evidence to improve human health.",

        "Abstract": "Although the expression of angiogenin (ANG), an angiogenic and tumorigenic factor, is elevated in various types of cancers, its regulation mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, in silico search predicted that miR-409-3p targeted to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the ANG mRNA. Overexpression of miR-409-3p in fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells resulted in decreased steady-state level of ANG transcript and ANG production which were achieved through direct binding of this miRNA to the ANG 3'UTR. The suppressions of miR-409-3p to rRNA transcription, cell proliferation and vasculogenic mimicry could be partially restored by overexpression of ANG with a mutated binding site of miR-409-3p within the ANG 3'UTR. Ectopic expression of miR-409-3p in transplanted HT1080 cells led to the retardation of tumor growth, vascularization and lung metastasis in mouse tumor xenografts. In these xenografts tissues, the expression of miR-409-3p displayed an inverse correlation with ANG, which was also detected in human fibrosarcoma samples. In addition, the suppression effects of miR-409-3p on cell proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro were also found in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that miR-409-3p inhibits tumor growth, vascularization and metastasis through down-regulating ANG expression.",

        "Abstract": "The increasing availability of personal genome data has led to escalating needs by consumers to understand the implications of their gene sequences. At present, poorly integrated genetic knowledge has not met these needs. This proof-of-concept study proposes a similarity-based approach to assess the disease risk predisposition for personal genomes. We hypothesize that the semantic similarity between a personal genome and a disease can indicate the disease risks in the person. We developed a knowledge network that integrates existing knowledge of genes, diseases, and symptoms from six sources using the Semantic Web standard, Resource Description Framework (RDF). We then used latent relationships between genes and diseases derived from our knowledge network to measure the semantic similarity between a personal genome and a genetic disease. For demonstration, we showed the feasibility of assessing the disease risks in one personal genome and discussed related methodology issues.",

Research recruitment alerts have been designed to facilitate physician referrals but limited support is available to clinical researchers. We conducted a retrospective data analysis to evaluate the efficacy of a real-time patient identification alert delivered to clinical research coordinators recruiting for a clinical prospective cohort study. Data from log analysis and informal interviews with coordinators were triangulated. Over a 12-month period, 11,295 were screened electronically, 1,449 were interviewed, and 282 were enrolled. The enrollment rates for the alert and two other conventional methods were 4.65%, 2.01%, and 1.34% respectively. A taxonomy of eligibility status was proposed to precisely categorize research patients. Practical ineligibility factors were identified and their correlation with age and gender were analyzed. We conclude that the automatic prescreening alert improves screening efficiency and is an effective aid to clinical research coordinators.",

However, eligibility criteria are often written as free text, which is not amenable for computer processing. In this paper, we present an ontology-based approach to extracting temporal information from clinical research eligibility criteria. We generated temporal labels using a frame-based temporal ontology. We manually annotated 150 free-text eligibility criteria using the temporal labels and trained a parser using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to automatically extract temporal expressions from eligibility criteria. An evaluation of an additional 60 randomly selected eligibility criteria using manual review achieved an overall precision of 83%, a recall of 79%, and an F-score of 80%. We illustrate the application of temporal extraction with the use cases of question answering and free-text criteria querying.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines PubMed knowledge and Electronic Health Records to develop a weighted Bayesian Network Inference (BNI) model for pancreatic cancer prediction. We selected 20 common risk factors associated with pancreatic cancer and used PubMed knowledge to weigh the risk factors. A keyword-based algorithm was developed to extract and classify PubMed abstracts into three categories that represented positive, negative, or neutral associations between each risk factor and pancreatic cancer. Then we designed a weighted BNI model by adding the normalized weights into a conventional BNI model. We used this model to extract the EHR values for patients with or without pancreatic cancer, which then enabled us to calculate the prior probabilities for the 20 risk factors in the BNI. The software iDiagnosis was designed to use this weighted BNI model for predicting pancreatic cancer. In an evaluation using a case-control dataset, the weighted BNI model significantly outperformed the conventional BNI and two other classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine). We conclude that the weighted BNI using PubMed knowledge and EHR data shows remarkable accuracy improvement over existing representative methods for pancreatic cancer prediction.",

We extracted 10,000 sentences from the eligibility criteria sections of clinical trial summaries contained in ClinicalTrials.gov. The UMLS Metathesaurus and SPECIALIST Lexical Tools were used to extract and normalize UMLS recognizable terms. When annotated with Semantic Network types, the corpus had a lexical ambiguity of 1.57 (=total types for unique lexemes / total unique lexemes) and a word occurrence ambiguity of 1.96 (=total type occurrences / total word occurrences). A set of semantic preference rules was developed and applied to completely eliminate ambiguity in semantic type assignment. The lexicon covered 95.95% UMLS-recognizable terms in our corpus. A total of 20 UMLS semantic types, representing about 17% of all the distinct semantic types assigned to corpus lexemes, covered about 80% of the vocabulary of our corpus.",

This paper reports some data quality issues we encountered in a survival analysis of pancreatic cancer patients. Using the clinical data warehouse at Columbia University Medical Center in the City of New York, we mined EHR data elements collected between 1999 and 2009 for a cohort of pancreatic cancer patients. Of the 3068 patients who had ICD-9-CM diagnoses for pancreatic cancer, only 1589 had corresponding disease documentation in pathology reports. Incompleteness was the leading data quality issue; many study variables had missing values to various degrees. Inaccuracy and inconsistency were the next common problems. In this paper, we present the manifestations of these data quality issues and discuss some strategies for using emerging informatics technologies to solve these problems.",

It uses the UMLS Semantic Types to represent semantic features and the Hierarchical Clustering method to group similar eligibility criteria. By establishing a gold standard using two independent raters, we evaluated the coverage and accuracy of the induced semantic classes. On 2,718 random eligibility criteria sentences, the inter-rater classification agreement was 85.73%. In a 10-fold validation test, the average Precision, Recall and F-score of the classification results of a decision-tree classifier were 87.8%, 88.0%, and 87.7% respectively. Our induced classes well aligned with 16 out of 17 eligibility criteria classes defined by the BRIDGE model. We discuss the potential of this method and our future work.",

        "Abstract": "It is well recognized that an interdisciplinary approach is essential in the development and implementation of solutions to address the current pediatric obesity epidemic. In two half-day meetings that included workshops and focus groups, faculty from diverse fields identified critically important research challenges, and gaps to childhood obesity prevention. The purpose of this white paper is to describe the iterative, interdisciplinary process that unfolded in an academic health center setting with a specific focus on underrepresented minority groups of Black and Hispanic communities, and to summarize the research challenges and gaps related to pediatric obesity that were identified in the process. Although the research challenges and gaps were developed in the context of an urban setting including high-risk populations (the northern Manhattan communities of Washington Heights, Inwood, and Harlem), many of the issues raised are broadly applicable. The processes by which the group identified research gaps and methodological challenges that impede a better understanding of how to prevent and treat obesity in children has resulted in an increase in research and community outreach collaborations and interdisciplinary pursuit of funding opportunities across units within the academic health center and overall university.",

        "Title": "Developing a multivariable prognostic model for pancreatic endocrine tumors using the clinical data warehouse resources of a single institution.",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Current staging systems are not accurate for classifying pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) by risk. Here, we developed a prognostic model for PETs and compared it to the WHO classification system. METHODS: We identified 98 patients diagnosed with PET at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center (1999 to 2009). Tumor and clinical characteristics were retrieved and associations with survival were assessed by univariate Cox analysis. A multivariable model was constructed and a risk score was calculated; the prognostic strength of our model was assessed with the concordance index. RESULTS: Our cohort had median age of 60 years and consisted of 61.2% women; median follow-up time was 10.4 months (range: 0.1-99.6) with a 5-year survival of 61.5%. The majority of PETs were non-functional and no difference was observed between functional and non-functional tumors with respect to WHO stage, age, pathologic characteristics or survival. Distant metastases, aspartate aminotransferase-AST and surgical resection (HR=3.39, 95% CI: 1.38-8.35, p=0.008, HR=3.73, 95% CI: 1.20-11.57, p=0.023 and HR=0.20, 95% CI: 0.08-0.51, p<0.001 respectively) were the strongest predictors in the univariate analysis. Age, perineural and/or lymphovascular invasion, distant metastases and AST were the independent prognostic factors in the final multivariable model; a risk score was calculated and classified patients into low (n=40), intermediate (n=48) and high risk (n=10) groups. The concordance index of our model was 0.93 compared to 0.72 for the WHO system. CONCLUSION: Our prognostic model was highly accurate in stratifying patients by risk; novel approaches as such could thus be incorporated into clinical decisions.",

        "Abstract": "Standards-based, computable knowledge representations for eligibility criteria are increasingly needed to provide computer-based decision support for automated research participant screening, clinical evidence application, and clinical research knowledge management. We surveyed the literature and identified five aspects of eligibility criteria knowledge representation that contribute to the various research and clinical applications: the intended use of computable eligibility criteria, the classification of eligibility criteria, the expression language for representing eligibility rules, the encoding of eligibility concepts, and the modeling of patient data. We consider three of these aspects (expression language, codification of eligibility concepts, and patient data modeling) to be essential constructs of a formal knowledge representation for eligibility criteria. The requirements for each of the three knowledge constructs vary for different use cases, which therefore should inform the development and choice of the constructs toward cost-effective knowledge representation efforts. We discuss the implications of our findings for standardization efforts toward knowledge representation for sharable and computable eligibility criteria.",

        "Abstract": "Principal-component analysis (PCA) has been used for decades to summarize the human genetic variation across geographic regions and to infer population migration history. Reduction of spurious associations due to population structure is crucial for the success of disease association studies. Recently, PCA has also become a popular method for detecting population structure and correction of population stratification in disease association studies. Inspired by manifold learning, we propose a novel method based on spectral graph theory. Regarding each study subject as a node with suitably defined weights for its edges to close neighbors, one can form a weighted graph. We suggest using the spectrum of the associated graph Laplacian operator, namely, Laplacian eigenfunctions, to infer population structures instead of principal components (PCs). For the whole genome-wide association data for the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) provided by Genetic Workshop Analysis 16, Laplacian eigenfunctions revealed more meaningful structures of the underlying population than PCA. The proposed method has connection to PCA, and it naturally includes PCA as a special case. Our simple method is computationally fast and is suitable for disease studies at the genome-wide scale.",

        "Abstract": "This study evaluated the performance of an electronic screening (E-screening) method and used it to recruit patients for the NIH sponsored ACCORD trial. Out of the 193 E-screened patients, 125 met the age criterion (\"age>or=40\"). For all of these 125 patients, the performance of E-screening was compared with investigator review. E-screening achieved a negative predictive accuracy of 100% (95% CI: 98-100%), a positive predictive accuracy of 13% (95% CI: 6-13%), a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 45-100%), and a specificity of 84% (95% CI: 82-84%). The method maximized the use of a patient database query (i.e., excluded ineligible patients with a 100% accuracy and automatically assembled patient information to facilitate manual review of only patients who were classified as \"potentially eligible\" by E-screening) and significantly reduced the screening burden associated with the ACCORD trial.",

The result of this attention has been the development of auditing methods that apply formal methods to assessing whether terminologies are complete and accurate. We have performed an extensive literature review to identify published descriptions of these methods and have created a framework for characterizing them. The framework considers manual, systematic and heuristic methods that use knowledge (within or external to the terminology) to measure quality factors of different aspects of the terminology content (terms, semantic classification, and semantic relationships). The quality factors examined included concept orientation, consistency, non-redundancy, soundness and comprehensive coverage. We reviewed 130 studies that were retrieved based on keyword search on publications in PubMed, and present our assessment of how they fit into our framework. We also identify which terminologies have been audited with the methods and provide examples to illustrate each part of the framework.",

The tradeoffs of using information in either data format for clinical trials screening are understudied. This paper compares the results of clinical trial eligibility queries over ICD9-encoded diagnoses and NLP-processed textual discharge summaries. The strengths and weaknesses of both data sources are summarized along the following dimensions: information completeness, expressiveness, code granularity, and accuracy of temporal information.

        "Abstract": "This paper reports a campus-wide survey of obesity experts that allowed us to understand organizational factors and collaboration patterns affiliated with health sciences research. By combining Google and PubMed searches and the snowball sampling method, we identified and then surveyed 113 obesity experts on their collaborators, research interests, and affiliations with academic departments and research centers. The response rate was 61%. We describe the diversity in organizational affiliations, research interests, journals for disseminating results, and collaboration patterns among the respondents. We also analyze the challenges and research opportunities related to identifying experts and forging interdisciplinary health sciences collaborations. We conclude with possible success factors for sustained interdisciplinary collaborations.",

        "Abstract": "Angiogenin is an angiogenic factor involved in tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism of angiogenin's action remains elusive. In the present study, we identified fibulin 1, an extracellular matrix and plasma glycoprotein, as an angiogenin-interacting molecule by yeast two-hybrid screening. This interaction was further confirmed by two different approaches. First, fibulin 1 was co-immunoprecipitated with angiogenin by anti-angiogenin monoclonal antibody in vitro, suggesting angiogenin binds with fibulin 1 directly. Then fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis showed that fibulin 1 interacted with angiogenin in COS-7 cells, showing that the binding could occur in a cellular context. As fibulin 1 plays an important role in cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and stabilizes new-forming blood vessel wall, the interaction between fibulin 1 and angiogenin might underline one possible mechanism of angiogenin in angiogenesis and/or tumorigenesis.",

Methods such as ontology alignment or use of metadata neither scale nor fundamentally alleviate semantic heterogeneity among information sources. In the context of the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid program, the Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group (BRIDG) has been making an ambitious effort to harmonize existing information models for clinical research from a variety of sources and modeling agreed-upon semantics shared by the technical harmonization committee and the developers of these models. This paper provides some observations on this user-centered semantic harmonization effort and its inherent technical and social challenges. The authors also compare BRIDG with related efforts to achieve semantic interoperability in healthcare, including UMLS, InterMed, the Semantic Web, and the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations initiative. The BRIDG project demonstrates the feasibility of user-centered collaborative domain modeling as an approach to semantic harmonization, but also highlights a number of technology gaps in support of collaborative semantic harmonization that remain to be filled.",

We also designed a collaborative writing system to facilitate its protocol reviewing and revising processes over the Internet. After a series of iterative prototyping and formative evaluations over the past two years, we identified a social-technical gap in our group work support research at SWOG. This gap consists of technical challenges, expanding user needs, conflicting user needs from different roles, insufficient incentive for using groupware technology by certain members, subtle organizational nuances, and the changing organizational structure. This paper describes our longitudinal evaluations results and elaborates on the social-technical gap. We think this gap may generalize to other healthcare group work settings.",

        "Abstract": "Group work is an essential part of modern health care. Although there have been advances in the technology of communication, these have not necessarily led to efficient and effective communication among collaborating health-care professionals. Instead, barriers such as varied organizational cultures, different training backgrounds, and varied time schedules can overwhelm technological solutions and impede efficient communication. We focus on one particular sort of collaboration, that of group work around a clinical trial protocol, where the collaboration is asynchronous and the participants are geographically distributed. In this work setting, we have applied a computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) approach in two distinct ways. First, we used observational methods to uncover and understand a complex set of communication behaviors and needs. Second, we used participatory design and iterative prototyping to design a system that aims to improve communication and work flow among these collaborators. We found that these methods work well in tandem-our observational study helped better inform our design, and our prototyping cycles provided additional insight into the work. More specifically, we were able to identify a set of communication problems in the work that led us to specify a set of design desiderata for systems that support asynchronous collaboration around an evolving medical document.",

        "Abstract": "Increasing complexity in medicine has caused clinical trial experts with disparate backgrounds from multiple organizations to collaborate when developing clinical trial protocols. Although many protocol-authoring tools provide computerbased decision support to assist in protocol writing, few of them provide sufficient collaboration support for a group of protocol writers. The iterative group writing activities among interdisciplinary clinical trial experts call for advanced tool support. Here we present a web-based protocol writing system with integrated support for collaborative reviewing and collaborative editing. The system uses a shared database to store threaded review comments and version information for electronic protocols. It also captures rich group event information to provide cross-activity awareness and to facilitate self-coordination within the collaborative writing team. We believe that our system can help streamline collaborative clinical trial protocol writing processes.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical trial protocol documents play an important role in clinical research. However, clinical protocol writing remains a complex and relatively un-studied process. Protocols are often written by teams of people, yet little prior research has captured the problems or analyzed the collaboration support needs of protocol writers. Here we present the results of an initial ethnographic study into the clinical trial protocol writing processes at a representative cooperative clinical trial group funded by National Cancer Institute (NCI). We analyzed the collaborative nature of the writing process, identified common problems, derived information and communication support needs of collaborative clinical protocol writers, and provided recommendations to streamline the process. We believe that this paper contributes useful implications for the design of future collaborative clinical protocol writing tools.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical trial protocols include detailed temporal constraints on treatment and associated tasks. Unlike health-care guidelines, protocols are highly prescriptive. Therefore, informatics applications that enforce such temporal constraints are more directly useful with protocols than with guidelines. Although there are some temporal knowledge representation efforts for health-care guidelines, we find these to be insufficiently expressive for clinical trial protocols. In this paper, we focus on temporal knowledge representation for clinical trial protocols and the task of patient-specific scheduling in protocols. We define a temporal ontology, use it to encode clinical trial protocols, and describe a prototype tool to carry out patient-specific scheduling for the tasks in protocols. We predict that an expressive temporal knowledge representation can support a number of scheduling and management tasks for protocol-based care.",
