        "Abstract": "Novel strategies are needed to improve low rates of lung cancer screening (LCS) in the US. Seeking to determine hospitalists' perspectives on leveraging hospitalizations to identify patients eligible for LCS, we performed qualitative interviews with eight hospitalists from two hospitals within a large integrated healthcare system. The interviews used semi-structured questions to assess (1) knowledge and practice of general screening and LCS guidelines from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), (2) identification of smoking history, and (3) hospitalists' views on how data obtained during hospitalization may be utilized to improve general screening and LCS post hospitalization. We ultimately reached the conclusion that hospitalists would support a dedicated program to identify hospitalized patients eligible for LCS and facilitate testing after discharge. Efforts to identify patients and arrange subsequent screening should be performed by team members outside the inpatient team.",

        "Abstract": "Research on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for common, genetically complex chronic diseases aims to improve health-related predictions, tailor risk-reducing interventions, and improve health outcomes. Yet, the study and use of PRSs in clinical settings raise equity, clinical, and regulatory challenges that can be greater for individuals from historically marginalized racial, ethnic, and other minoritized communities. As part of the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics IV Network, we conducted online focus groups with patients/community members, clinicians, and members of institutional review boards to explore their views on key issues, including PRS research, return of PRS results, clinical translation, and barriers and facilitators to health behavioral changes in response to PRS results. Across stakeholder groups, our findings indicate support for PRS development and a strong interest in having PRS results returned to research participants. However, we also found multi-level barriers and significant differences in stakeholders' views about what is needed and possible for successful implementation. These include researcher-participant interaction formats, health and genomic literacy, and a range of structural barriers, such as financial instability, insurance coverage, and the absence of health-supporting infrastructure and affordable healthy food options in poorer neighborhoods. Our findings highlight the need to revisit and implement measures in PRS studies (e.g., incentives and resources for follow-up care), as well as system-level policies to promote equity in genomic research and health outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Disparities in data underlying clinical genomic interpretation is an acknowledged problem, but there is a paucity of data demonstrating it. The All of Us Research Program is collecting data including whole-genome sequences, health records, and surveys for at least a million participants with diverse ancestry and access to healthcare, representing one of the largest biomedical research repositories of its kind. Here, we examine pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants that were identified in the All of Us cohort. The European ancestry subgroup showed the highest overall rate of pathogenic variation, with 2.26% of participants having a pathogenic variant. Other ancestry groups had lower rates of pathogenic variation, including 1.62% for the African ancestry group and 1.32% in the Latino/Admixed American ancestry group. Pathogenic variants were most frequently observed in genes related to Breast/Ovarian Cancer or Hypercholesterolemia. Variant frequencies in many genes were consistent with the data from the public gnomAD database, with some notable exceptions resolved using gnomAD subsets. Differences in pathogenic variant frequency observed between ancestral groups generally indicate biases of ascertainment of knowledge about those variants, but some deviations may be indicative of differences in disease prevalence. This work will allow targeted precision medicine efforts at revealed disparities.",

        "Abstract": "Background Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is an underdiagnosed cause of heart failure (HF) among patients \u226560\u2009years of age. Although the V122I (valine to isoleucine substitution at position 122 of the transthyretin protein) variant associated with hereditary ATTR-CM is present in 3.4% of self-identified Black individuals in the United States (or 1.5\u2009million people), the phenotypic penetrance is not known. Methods and Results The SCAN-MP (Screening for Cardiac Amyloidosis With Nuclear Imaging in Minority Populations) study is a currently accruing prospective multisite study designed to determine the prevalence of ATTR-CM using technetium-99m-pyrophosphate imaging in older (\u226560\u2009years of age) self-identified Black and Hispanic individuals with HF. Calculations of the penetrance and prevalence of the V122I allele, along with analyses of functional, biochemical, and echocardiographic parameters, were performed for the first 278 Black participants in SCAN-MP. The prevalence of ATTR-CM was 6.8% (95% CI, 4.2-10.5; n=19 cases), of whom 63% were ATTR wild-type. The prevalence of V122I was 6.5% (n=18 carriers), of whom 7 had ATTR-CM, yielding a phenotypic penetrance of 39% (95% CI, 17-64). V122I carriers with ATTR-CM evidenced more advanced HF than carriers without ATTR-CM. Prealbumin concentration was lowest among V122I carriers with ATTR-CM (12.9\u2009mg/dL) versus carriers without ATTR-CM (21.0\u2009mg/dL) and HF controls (25.0\u2009mg/dL, ",

        "Abstract": "Patients with heart failure (HF) often have multiple chronic conditions and are at increased risk for severe disease and mortality when infected by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Furthermore, disparities in outcomes with COVID-19 have been associated with both racial/ethnic identity but also social determinants of health. Among older, urban-dwelling, minority patients with HF, we sought to characterize medical and non-medical factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with HF living in Boston and New York City over 60 years of age participating in the Screening for Cardiac Amyloidosis with Nuclear Imaging (SCAN-MP) study between 12/1/2019 and 10/15/2021 (n = 180) were tested for nucleocapsid antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and queried for symptomatic infection with PCR verification. Baseline testing included the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), assessment of health literacy, biochemical, functional capacity, echocardiography, and a novel survey tool that determined living conditions, perceived risk of infection, and attitudes towards COVID-19 mitigation. The association of infection with prevalent socio-economic conditions was assessed by the area deprivation index (ADI). There were 50 overall cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (28%) including 40 demonstrating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (indicative of prior infection) and 10 positive PCR tests. There was no overlap between these groups. The first documented case from New York City indicated infection prior to January 17, 2020. Among active smokers, none tested positive for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (0 (0%) vs. 20 (15%), p = 0.004) vs. non-smokers. Cases were more likely to be taking ACE-inhibitors/ARBs compared to non-cases (78% vs 62%, p = 0.04). Over a mean follow-up of 9.6 months, there were 6 total deaths (3.3%) all unrelated to COVID-19. Death and hospitalizations (n = 84) were not associated with incident (PCR tested) or prior (antibody) SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was no difference in age, co-morbidities, living conditions, attitudes toward mitigation, health literacy, or ADI between those with and without infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection was common among older, minority patients with HF living in New York City and Boston, with evidence of infection documented in early January 2020. Health literacy and ADI were not associated with infection, and there was no increased mortality or hospitalizations among those infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

        "Title": "Investigation of hypertension and type 2 diabetes as risk factors for dementia in the All of Us cohort.",
        "Abstract": "The World Health Organization recently defined hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as modifiable comorbidities leading to dementia and Alzheimer's disease. In the United States (US), hypertension and T2D are health disparities, with higher prevalence seen for Black and Hispanic minority groups compared to the majority White population. We hypothesized that elevated prevalence of hypertension and T2D risk factors in Black and Hispanic groups may be associated with dementia disparities. We interrogated this hypothesis using a cross-sectional analysis of participant data from the All of Us (AoU) Research Program, a large observational cohort study of US residents. The specific objectives of our study were: (1) to compare the prevalence of dementia, hypertension, and T2D in the AoU cohort to previously reported prevalence values for the US population, (2) to investigate the association of hypertension, T2D, and race/ethnicity with dementia, and (3) to investigate whether race/ethnicity modify the association of hypertension and T2D with dementia. AoU participants were recruited from 2018 to 2019 as part of the initial project cohort (R2019Q4R3). Participants aged 40-80 with electronic health records and demographic data (age, sex, race, and ethnicity) were included for analysis, yielding a final cohort of 125,637 individuals. AoU participants show similar prevalence of hypertension (32.1%) and T2D (13.9%) compared to the US population (32.0% and 10.5%, respectively); however, the prevalence of dementia for AoU participants (0.44%) is an order of magnitude lower than seen for the US population (5%). AoU participants with dementia show a higher prevalence of hypertension (81.6% vs. 31.9%) and T2D (45.9% vs. 11.4%) compared to non-dementia participants. Dominance analysis of a multivariable logistic regression model with dementia as the outcome shows that hypertension, age, and T2D have the strongest associations with dementia. Hispanic was the only race/ethnicity group that showed a significant association with dementia, and the association of sex with dementia was non-significant. The association of T2D with dementia is likely explained by concurrent hypertension, since\u2009>\u200990% of participants with T2D also had hypertension. Black race and Hispanic ethnicity interact with hypertension, but not T2D, to increase the odds of dementia. This study underscores the utility of the AoU participant cohort to study disease prevalence and risk factors. We do notice a lower participation of aged minorities and participants with dementia, revealing an opportunity for targeted engagement. Our results indicate that targeting hypertension should be a priority for risk factor modifications to reduce dementia incidence.",

        "Abstract": "Community engagement (CE) is critical for advancing health equity and a key approach for promoting inclusive clinical and translational science. However, it requires a workforce trained to effectively design, implement, and evaluate health promotion and improvement strategies through meaningful collaboration with community members. This paper presents an approach for designing CE curricula for research, education, clinical care, and public health learners. A general pedagogical framework is presented to support curriculum development with the inclusion of community members as facilitators or faculty. The overall goal of the curriculum is envisioned as enabling learners to effectively demonstrate the principles of CE in working with community members on issues of concern to communities to promote health and well-being. We highlight transformations needed for the commonly used critical service-learning model and the importance of faculty well-versed in CE. Courses may include didactics and practicums with well-defined objectives and evaluation components. Because of the importance of building and maintaining relationships in CE, a preparatory phase is recommended prior to experiential learning, which should be guided and designed to include debriefing and reflective learning. Depending on the scope of the course, evaluation should include community perspectives on the experience.",

        "Abstract": "School-age children, adolescents, and young adults with autism spectrum disorder encounter many different types of providers in their pursuit of treatment for anxiety, behavior problems, and social difficulties. These providers may all be familiar with different types of intervention practices. However, research has not yet investigated patterns in expert providers' familiarity with different practices nor how these patterns are related to the characteristics of providers (years in practice, academic discipline, setting) and the youth (age and intellectual disability) they typically support. A panel of 53 expert transdisciplinary providers rated their familiarity with 55 intervention practices (derived from research and expert nominations) via an online Delphi poll. Advanced statistical methods were used to identify types of intervention practices with which providers were familiar, which included two approaches (cognitive and behavioral) and two strategies (engagement and accessibility). Providers who practiced outside a school setting or treated clients without intellectual disability were more familiar with cognitive approaches. Clinical psychologists, behavior analysts, and school-based providers were more familiar with behavioral approaches. Providers practicing outside school settings were also more familiar with engagement strategies, and providers with more years in practice were more familiar with accessibility strategies. These results may help families and researchers to better anticipate how services may vary depending on the types of autism spectrum disorder providers seen and work to reduce disparities in care that may result.",

Genomic medicine is the study of genes and their interaction with health. Precision medicine is an approach to disease prevention and treatment that considers individual variability in genes, environment\u00a0and lifestyle. Conclusions from studies lacking diversity may hinder generalizability as genomic variation occurs within and between populations. Historical factors, such as medical mistrust, ethical issues related to decision making, and data sharing pose complex challenges that may further widen inequities in genomic/precision medicine if not appropriately addressed. Although few biomedical studies integrate priorities of community partners into their conceptual framework, effective implementation of genomic/precision medicine research calls for the involvement of diverse stakeholders to expand traditional unidirectional models of engagement in clinical research towards authentic bidirectional collaboration.",

        "Abstract": "Differences in obesity and body fat distribution across gender and race/ethnicity have been extensively described. We sought to replicate these differences and evaluate newly emerging data from the All of Us Research Program (AoU). We compared body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio from the baseline physical examination, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) from the electronic health record in up to 88,195 Non-Hispanic White (NHW), 40,770 Non-Hispanic Black (NHB), 35,640 Hispanic, and 5,648 Asian participants. We compared AoU sociodemographic variable distribution to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data and applied the pseudo-weighting method for adjusting selection biases of AoU recruitment. Our findings replicate previous observations with respect to gender differences in BMI. In particular, we replicate the large gender disparity in obesity rates among NHB participants, in which obesity and mean BMI are much higher in NHB women than NHB men (33.34 kg/m2 versus 28.40 kg/m2 respectively; p<2.22x10-308). The overall age-adjusted obesity prevalence in AoU participants is similar overall but lower than the prevalence found in NHANES for NHW participants. ALT was higher in men than women, and lower among NHB participants compared to other racial/ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings. Our data suggest consistency of AoU with national averages related to obesity and suggest this resource is likely to be a major source of scientific inquiry and discovery in diverse populations.",

        "Abstract": "The All of Us Research Program was designed to enable broad-based precision medicine research in a cohort of unprecedented scale and diversity. Hypertension (HTN) is a major public health concern. The validity of HTN data and definition of hypertension cases in the All of Us (AoU) Research Program for use in rule-based algorithms is unknown. In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we\u00a0compare HTN prevalence in the AoU Research Program to HTN prevalence in the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We used AoU baseline data from patient (age\u2009\u2265\u200918) measurements (PM), surveys, and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements. We retrospectively examined the prevalence of HTN in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR. We defined HTN as the participant having at least 2 HTN diagnosis/billing codes on separate dates in the EHR data AND at least one HTN medication. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59,\u2009and\u00a0\u2265\u200960). Among the 185,770 participants enrolled in the AoU Cohort (mean age at enrollment\u2009=\u200951.2\u00a0years) available in a Researcher Workbench as of October 2019, EHR data was available for at least one SNOMED code from 112,805 participants, medications for 104,230 participants, and 103,490 participants had both medication and SNOMED data. The total number of persons with SNOMED codes on at least two distinct dates and at least one antihypertensive medication was 33,310 for a crude prevalence of HTN of 32.2%. AoU age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% using 3 groups compared to 29.6% in NHANES. The AoU cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data to study hypertension nationwide and develop precision rule-based algorithms for use in hypertension treatment and prevention research. The prevalence of hypertension in this cohort is similar to that in prior population-based surveys.",

        "Abstract": "Dissemination and implementation (D&I) science is dedicated to studying how to effectively translate and apply research in real-world contexts. There has been increasing interest in health equity within the D&I field to ensure the equitable implementation of evidence-based programs/practices across a range of diverse populations and settings. At the same time, health equity researchers recognize the potential of D&I science to promote the more widespread dissemination, implementation, and sustainment of evidence-based interventions to address health inequities. The National Center for Accelerating Clinical and Translational Science Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program has been a champion for community engagement and translational scholarship in its mission to improve individual and population health. The overall CTSA infrastructure and resources within and among CTSA hubs are well-equipped to facilitate a health equity focus to D&I across the phases of translational research. This paper proposes a framework that demonstrates the interaction and opportunities between health equity and D&I science and highlights how CTSAs can support and facilitate wider efforts in translational research with a focus on equitable D&I.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge gained from observational cohort studies has dramatically advanced the prevention and treatment of diseases. Many of these cohorts, however, are small, lack diversity, or do not provide comprehensive phenotype data. The All of Us Research Program plans to enroll a diverse group of at least 1 million persons in the United States in order to accelerate biomedical research and improve health. The program aims to make the research results accessible to participants, and it is developing new approaches to generate, access, and make data broadly available to approved researchers. All of Us opened for enrollment in May 2018 and currently enrolls participants 18 years of age or older from a network of more than 340 recruitment sites. Elements of the program protocol include health questionnaires, electronic health records (EHRs), physical measurements, the use of digital health technology, and the collection and analysis of biospecimens. As of July 2019, more than 175,000 participants had contributed biospecimens. More than 80% of these participants are from groups that have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research. EHR data on more than 112,000 participants from 34 sites have been collected. The All of Us data repository should permit researchers to take into account individual differences in lifestyle, socioeconomic factors, environment, and biologic characteristics in order to advance precision diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.",

We conducted a concept analysis to define the concept of \"implementation of CPGs in health care settings.\" We utilized Walker and Avant's methodology to define the concept of \"implementation of CPGs in health care settings.\" This included a focused review of the literature, defining the relevant attributes, defining implementation, case examples, and antecedents and potential consequences from implementation of CPGs in health care settings. The concept \"implementation\" is complex, with numerous frameworks, facilitators, and barriers to implementation described in the literature. The existing literature supports our definition of implementation of CPGs in a health care setting as a process of changing practice in health care while utilizing the best level of evidence that is available in the published literature. These include 7 attributes necessary for effective implementation. Implementation of CPGs in health care settings requires an ongoing iterative process that considers these attributes and is inclusive to administrators, clinicians, and patients to ensure guidelines are understood, accepted, implemented, and evaluated for continued adoption of best practices. Ongoing efforts inclusive at all steps of implementation across multiple levels are needed to effectively change practice.",

Data came from the Texas Adolescent Tobacco and Marketing Surveillance system (TATAMS), a longitudinal cohort study of students who were in the 6th, 8th, and 10th grades (n\u202f=\u202f3907) during the 2014-2015 academic year. Weighted generalized linear mixed models assessed multiple predictors' associated with the transition to susceptibility to e-cigarettes at 12\u202fmonths. Among 6th graders, family influence, use of other substances, and positive affect were important. Adolescents transitioning from 8th grade to high school presented the greatest number of risk factors (e.g., social and normative influences). Only sensation seeking increased the risk of susceptibility to e-cigarettes among 10th graders. Overall, by grade level, incidence of susceptibility to e-cigarettes at 12\u202fmonths did not vary, but risk factor profiles varied substantially.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding usual care is important to reduce health disparities and improve the dissemination of evidence-based practices for youth (ages 7-22\u00a0years) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A barrier to describing \"usual ASD care\" is the lack of a common vocabulary and inventory of the practices used by a diverse provider field. To address this barrier, we gathered input from expert providers to develop an inventory of usual care practices and assess expert familiarity and perceptions of these practices as interventions for anxiety, externalizing, and social difficulties in ASD. Purposeful sampling recruited 66 expert ASD providers representing multiple disciplines from 5 sites. Via a 2-round Delphi poll, experts reviewed, suggested revisions to and rated 49 literature-derived practices on several dimensions (familiarity, usefulness, common use, research support). A revised list of 55 practices and anonymous summary of group characteristics and ratings was then returned for further review. Results yielded 55 intervention practices, 48 of which were identified as \"familiar\" approaches by consensus (\u2265 75% endorsement). Greater variation was observed in practices identified by consensus as most often used, useful, and research supported, depending upon the target problem. Findings provide an inventory of practices, reflective of the multidisciplinary language and approaches of expert ASD providers. This inventory may be used to better assess what constitutes usual care for youth with ASD in the United States. Moreover, findings offer insights from clinical experts regarding the range and acceptability of practices that may inform and ground treatment research, dissemination, and implementation efforts.",

        "Abstract": "Historically, the tobacco industry has marketed directly to minority groups, which is associated with increased product use; the advent of e-cigarettes poses a new risk. The purpose of this study is to examine associations between exposure to tobacco marketing via traditional and digital marketing channels and ever use of e-cigarettes among Mexican-American young adults. Ninety-two Mexican-American young adults between 18 and 29 years of age (61% female) were recruited from the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort, a well-characterized population-based cohort on the U.S.- Mexico border. Participants reported their use of e-cigarettes and exposure to pro- and anti-media messages about these products in traditional and digital venues. Nearly one third reported ever using e-cigarettes and exposure to media overall was low. However, exposure to pro e-cigarette messages via digital sources was associated with increased odds of ever using e-cigarettes (OR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.11-7.38). Results suggest that regulations on e-cigarette digital media may help to reduce e-cigarette use.",

        "Abstract": "Precision medicine envisions a future of effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention grounded in precise understandings of the genetic and environmental determinants of disease. Given that the original genome-wide association studies represented a predominately European White population, and that diversity in genomic studies must account for genetic variation both within and across racial categories, new research studies are at a heightened risk for inadequate representation. Currently biological samples are being made available for sequencing in biobanks across the USA, but the diversity of those samples is unknown. The aims of this study were to describe the types of recruitment and enrollment materials used by US biobanks and the diversity of the samples contained within their collection. Biobank websites and brochures were evaluated for reading level, health literacy, and factors known to encourage the recruitment of minorities, such as showing pictures of diverse populations. Biobank managers were surveyed by mail on the methods and materials used for enrollment, recruitment, consent, and the self-reported race/ethnicity of biobank participants. From 51 US biobanks (68% response rate), recruitment and enrollment materials were in English only, and most of the websites and brochures exceeded a fifth-grade reading level. When compared to the 2015 US Census, self-reported race/ethnicity of participants was not significantly different for Whites (61%) and blacks (13%). The percentages were significantly lower for Hispanics and Latinos (18 vs. 7%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.00) and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders (0.2 vs. 0.01%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and higher for Asians (13 vs. 5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Materials for recruitment predominantly in English may limit participation by underrepresented populations.",

As such, nurse scientists should consider engaging the recipients of care in the research process. Community advisory boards are a common way in which communities are engaged in research. The purpose of this article is to provide a framework for effectively working with community advisory boards in diverse communities that is informed by evidence and experiences of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Nurse Faculty Scholars. Recommendations can serve as a blueprint for nurse scientists as they engage communities in research promoting health equity.",

Although racial and ethnic minorities represent 37% of Americans, they comprise only 16% of the nursing workforce. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of state legislation on minority recruitment to nursing. Using data from the National Conference of State Legislatures, American Association of Colleges of Nursing, and U.S. census, we compared minority enrollment in baccalaureate nursing programs of states (Texas, Virginia, Michigan, California, Florida, Connecticut, and Arkansas) before and 3 years after enacting legislation with geographically adjacent states without legislation. Data were analyzed using descriptive and chi-square statistics. Following legislation, Arkansas (13.8%-24.5%), California (3.3%-5.4%), and Michigan (8.0%-10.0%) significantly increased enrollment of Blacks, and Florida (11.8%-15.4%) and Texas (11.2%-13.9%) significantly increased enrollment of Hispanic baccalaureate nursing students. States that tied legislation to funding, encouragement, and reimbursement had larger enrollment gains and greater minority representation.",

        "Abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability and mortality. Intravenous thrombolysis can minimize disability when patients present to the emergency department for treatment within the 3\u2009-\u20094\u00bd\u2009h of symptom onset. Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to die and suffer disability from stroke than whites, due in part to delayed hospital arrival and ineligibility for intravenous thrombolysis for acute stroke. Low stroke literacy (poor knowledge of stroke symptoms and when to call 911) among Blacks and Hispanics compared to whites may contribute to disparities in acute stroke treatment and outcomes. Improving stroke literacy may be a critical step along the pathway to reducing stroke disparities. The aim of the current study is to test a novel intervention to increase stroke literacy in minority populations in New York City.",

        "Abstract": "Achieving equitable minority representation in genomic biobanking is one of the most difficult challenges faced by researchers today. Capacity building--a framework for research that includes collaborations and on-going engagement--can be used to help researchers, clinicians and communities better understand the process, utility, and clinical application of genomic science. The purpose of this exploratory descriptive study was to examine factors that influence the decision to participate in genomic research, and identify essential components of capacity building with a community at risk of being under-represented in biobanks. Results of focus groups conducted in Central Harlem with 46 participants were analyzed by a collaborative team of community and academic investigators using content analysis and AtlisTi. Key themes identified were: (1) the potential contribution of biobanking to individual and community health, for example the effect of the environment on health, (2) the societal context of the science, such as DNA criminal databases and paternity testing, that may affect the decision to participate, and (3) the researchers' commitment to community health as an outcome of capacity building. These key factors can contribute to achieving equity in biobank participation, and guide genetic specialists in biobank planning and implementation.",

        "Abstract": "We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of changes to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-5 on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and explore policy implications. We identified 418 studies; 14 met inclusion criteria. Studies consistently reported decreases in ASD diagnosis (range 7.3-68.4%) using DSM-5 criteria. There were statistically significant pooled decreases in ASD [31% (20-44), p = 0.006] and DSM-IV-TR subgroups of Autistic disorder [22% (16-29), p < 0.001] and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) [70% (55-82), p = 0.01]; however, Asperger's disorder pooled decrease was not significant [70% (26-94), p = 0.38]. DSM-5 will likely decrease the number of individuals diagnosed with ASD, particularly the PDD-NOS subgroup. Research is needed on policies regarding services for individuals lacking diagnosis but requiring assistance.",

This study describes the current practice of menu board calorie postings in a low-income urban neighborhood, identifies the extent to which current practice complies with existing policy, and evaluates the practical utility of menu boards to consumers. We conclude that although most postings were legally compliant, they did not demonstrate utility. Menu postings for individual servings are easily understood, but complex math skills are needed to interpret meals designed to serve more than one person. In some items, calories doubled depending on flavor and the calorie posting did not give enough information to make healthier selections. We identified specific strategies to improve practical utility and provide recommendations for policy implementation.",

        "Abstract": "Although collaborative research across sites is essential to increase the statistical power and generalizability of research findings, the need to undergo multiple institutional review board (IRB) reviews is a challenge. The purposes of this paper are to describe changes in the IRB submission process in 2 national multisite studies before and after the implementation of the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy rule (2002 and 2008) and to discuss implications for policy and practice related to human subjects research. In the second study, there was a shorter mean approval time and reduced variability in the decision about the level of review, the mean number of pages per application doubled, and an increased proportion of IRBs required conflict of interest and data use agreements. Possible approaches to further enhance the efficiency and streamlining of the research review process are suggested.",

The author reviews the current state of HIV vaccine development in response to the human and fiscal cost of the HIV epidemic, both in the United States and globally. A translational model is proposed for restructuring the process by which participants in HIV trials are recruited and the results disseminated. Finally, it is proposed that nurses should play a unique and essential role in implementing this new model, advocating for individuals, strengthening societal trust, and fostering equity.",

The sample for this study consisted of second-year baccalaureate nursing students in a required clinical skills course. Students in the control group were taught medication calculations using the traditional math method during one semester, whereas students in the experimental group were taught the same material using dimensional analysis during the next semester. Analysis of the collected data from a medication dosage calculation examination revealed the dimensional analysis group scored with greater accuracy than the traditional math group.",
