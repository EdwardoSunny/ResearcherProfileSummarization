        "Abstract": "Intensive Care Unit (ICU) survivorship comprises a burgeoning area of critical care medicine, largely due to our improved understanding of and concern for patients' recovery trajectory, and efforts to mitigate the post-acute complications of critical illness. Expansion of care beyond hospitalization is necessary, yet evidence for post-ICU clinics remains limited and mixed, as both interventions and target populations studied to date are too heterogenous to meaningfully demonstrate efficacy. Here, we briefly present the existing evidence and limitations related to post-ICU clinics, identify cardiac arrest survivors as a unique ICU subpopulation warranting further investigation and treatment, and propose a clinical framework that addresses the multifaceted needs of this well-defined patient population.",

This intervention's feasibility needs testing in psychologically distressed cardiac patients for whom heart-related anxiety is a core concern.

        "Abstract": "Patients evaluated in an emergency department for suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS; e.g., myocardial infarction) often experience a lingering fear of recurrence, which may adversely affect their mental health and adherence to recommended health behaviors. Cognitive bias modification training (CBMT) is an acceptable, easy-to-use intervention that reduces fear of recurrence in cancer patients, and reduces fear and anxiety in other populations, providing an alternative to psychotherapy or counseling-based approaches. Feasibility testing is needed to assess whether a cardiac-related version of CBMT is acceptable to patients with elevated threat perceptions related to their suspected ACS.",

        "Abstract": "Clinic-based or community-based interventions can improve adherence to guideline-directed medication therapies (GDMTs) among patients with heart failure (HF). However, opportunities for such interventions are frequently missed, as providers may be unable to recognise risk patterns for medication non-adherence. Machine learning algorithms can help in identifying patients with high likelihood of non-adherence. While a number of multilevel factors influence adherence, prior models predicting non-adherence have been limited by data availability. We have established an electronic health record (EHR)-based cohort with comprehensive data elements from multiple sources to improve on existing models. We linked EHR data with pharmacy refill data for real-time incorporation of prescription fills and with social determinants data to incorporate neighbourhood factors.",

        "Title": "Family-authored ICU diaries to reduce fear in patients experiencing a cardiac arrest (FAID fear): A pilot randomized controlled trial.",
        "Abstract": "Survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) and their family members often experience significant fear-based distress (cardiac fear; i.e., fear about the CA survivor's heart). Fear-based distress after CA is associated with higher rates of cardiac event recurrence and mortality in CA survivors. As posited in Dyadic Disruption Theory (DDT), cardiac fear in family members may contribute to the development of distress in CA survivors via socially-based mechanisms. Thus, interventions to reduce family distress may improve CA survivors' outcomes. ICU diaries are easy to implement and scalable and show promise for reducing distress after CA but are primarily targeted towards survivors. The primary aim of the Family-Authored ICU Diaries to reduce Fear in Patients Experiencing a CA (FAID Fear) pilot randomized controlled trial was to test feasibility of an ICU diary intervention targeted towards family member distress alone. Family members of patients hospitalized after CA (N = 16) were randomized 2:1 to receive the FAID Fear intervention or usual care. Intervention participants were provided brief instructions and were asked to write in the diary twice per week until the end of hospital care. Assessments occurred at baseline enrollment, end of hospital care, and 30 days later. Participants' mean age was 50.73 years (SD = 13.41; 80% cis-gender female; 60% White). Recruitment (16/25 referred; 64.0%), retention (14/16 enrolled; 87.5%), and intervention adherence (7/10 completed; 70%) were promising. Most agreed that the ICU diary intervention was appropriate (7/10 completed; 70.0%), feasible (9/10 completed; 90.0%]), and acceptable (8/10 completed; 80.0%). Fear was nonsignificantly lower in intervention participants (v. control) at end of hospital care and 30 days later. FAID Fear represents a first step in building theory-based dyadic interventions that can be implemented to support family members of CA survivors in the ICU, with potential to improve outcomes in CA survivors.",

        "Abstract": "Background Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Despite availability of effective lifestyle and medication treatments, blood pressure (BP) is poorly controlled in the United States. Mindfulness training may offer a novel approach to improve BP control. The objective was to evaluate the effects of Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction (MB-BP) versus enhanced usual care control on unattended office systolic BP. Methods and Results Methods included a parallel-group phase 2 randomized clinical trial conducted from June 2017 to November 2020. Follow-up time was 6\u2009months. Outcome assessors and data analyst were blinded to group allocation. Participants had elevated unattended office BP (\u2265120/80\u2009mm\u2009Hg). We randomized 201 participants to MB-BP (n=101) or enhanced usual care control (n=100). MB-BP is a mindfulness-based program adapted for elevated BP. Loss-to-follow-up was 17.4%. The primary outcome was change in unattended office systolic BP at 6 months. A total of 201 participants (58.7% women; 81.1% non-Hispanic White race and ethnicity; mean age, 59.5\u2009years) were randomized. Results showed that MB-BP was associated with a 5.9-mm\u2009Hg reduction (95% CI, -9.1 to -2.8\u2009mm Hg) in systolic BP from baseline and outperformed the control group by 4.5\u2009mm\u2009Hg at 6\u2009months (95% CI, -9.0 to -0.1\u2009mm Hg) in prespecified analyses. Plausible mechanisms with evidence to be impacted by MB-BP versus control were sedentary activity (-350.8 sitting min/wk [95% CI, -636.5 to -65.1] sitting min/wk), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet (0.32 score [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.67]), and mindfulness (7.3 score [95% CI, 3.0-11.6]). Conclusions A mindfulness-based program adapted for individuals with elevated BP showed clinically relevant reductions in systolic BP compared with enhanced usual care. Mindfulness training may be a useful approach to improve BP. Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifiers: NCT03256890 and NCT03859076.",

        "Abstract": "An N-of-1 trial is a multi-period crossover trial performed in a single individual, with a primary goal to estimate treatment effect on the individual instead of population-level mean responses. As in a conventional crossover trial, it is critical to understand carryover effects of the treatment in an N-of-1 trial, especially when no washout periods between treatment periods are instituted to reduce trial duration. To deal with this issue in situations where a high volume of measurements are made during the study, we introduce a novel Bayesian distributed lag model that facilitates the estimation of carryover effects, while accounting for temporal correlations using an autoregressive model. Specifically, we propose a prior variance-covariance structure on the lag coefficients to address collinearity caused by the fact that treatment exposures are typically identical on successive days. A connection between the proposed Bayesian model and penalized regression is noted. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model substantially reduces the root mean squared error in the estimation of carryover effects and immediate effects when compared to other existing methods, while being comparable in the estimation of the total effects. We also apply the proposed method to assess the extent of carryover effects of light therapies in relieving depressive symptoms in cancer survivors.",

        "Abstract": "Background Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) reduce mortality and hospitalization for patients with heart failure. However, relatively high copayments for ARNI may contribute to suboptimal adherence, thus potentially limiting their benefits. Methods and Results We conducted a retrospective cohort study within a large, multi-site health system. We included patients with: ARNI prescription between November 20, 2020 and June 30, 2021; diagnosis of heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction \u226440%; and available pharmacy or pharmacy benefit manager copayment data. The primary exposure was copayment, categorized as $0, $0.01 to $10, $10.01 to $100, and >$100. The primary outcome was prescription fill nonadherence, defined as the proportion of days covered <80% over 6\u2009months. We assessed the association between copayment and nonadherence using multivariable logistic regression, and nonbinarized proportion of days covered using multivariable Poisson regression, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and neighborhood-level covariates. A total of 921 patients met inclusion criteria, with 192 (20.8%) having $0 copayment, 228 (24.8%) with $0.01 to $10 copayment, 206 (22.4%) with $10.01 to $100, and 295 (32.0%) with >$100. Patients with higher copayments had higher rates of nonadherence, ranging from 17.2% for $0 copayment to 34.2% for copayment >$100 (",

        "Abstract": "Deprescribing has emerged as an important aspect of patient-centred medication management but is vastly underutilized in clinical practice. The current narrative review will describe an innovative patient-centred approach to deprescribing-N-of-1 trials. N-of-1 trials involve multiple-period crossover design experiments conducted within individual patients. They enable patients to compare the effects of two or more treatments or, in the case of deprescribing N-of-1 trials, continuation with a current treatment versus no treatment or placebo. N-of-1 trials are distinct from traditional between-patient studies such as parallel-group or crossover designs which provide an average effect across a group of patients and obscure differences between individuals. By generating data on the effect of an intervention for the individual rather than the population, N-of-1 trials can promote therapeutic precision. N-of-1 trials are a particularly appealing strategy to inform deprescribing because they can generate individual-level evidence for deprescribing when evidence is uncertain, and can thus allay patient and physician concerns about discontinuing medications. To illustrate the use of deprescribing N-of-1 trials, we share a case example of an ongoing series of N-of-1 trials that compare maintenance versus deprescribing of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. By providing quantifiable data on patient-reported outcomes, promoting personalized pharmacotherapy, and facilitating shared decision making, N-of-1 trials represent a potentially transformative strategy to address polypharmacy.",

        "Abstract": "Climate change is the greatest threat to global health in human history. It has been declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization and leading researchers from academic institutions around the globe. Structural racism disproportionately exposes communities targeted for marginalization to the harmful consequences of climate change through greater risk of exposure and sensitivity to climate hazards and less adaptive capacity to the health threats of climate change. Given its interdisciplinary approach to integrating behavioral, psychosocial, and biomedical knowledge, the discipline of behavioral medicine is uniquely qualified to address the systemic causes of climate change-related health inequities and can offer a perspective that is currently missing from many climate and health equity efforts. In this article, we summarize relevant concepts, describe how climate change and structural racism intersect to exacerbate health inequities, and recommend six strategies with the greatest potential for addressing climate-related health inequities.",

        "Abstract": "Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for recurrent stroke, and blood pressure (BP) reduction is associated with decreased risk of stroke recurrence. However, hypertension remains poorly controlled in many stroke survivors. Black and Hispanic patients have a higher prevalence of uncontrolled BP and higher rates of stroke. Limited access to care contributes to challenges in post-stroke care. Telehealth After Stroke Care (TASC) is a telehealth intervention that integrates remote BP monitoring (RBPM) including nursing telephone support, tailored BP infographics and telehealth video visits with a multidisciplinary team approach including pharmacy to improve post-stroke care and reduce stroke disparities.",

        "Abstract": "The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol recommends statin therapy for eligible patients to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). We extracted electronic health record data for patients with at least one primary care or cardiology visit between October 2018 and January 2020 at an urban, academic medical center in New York City. Clinical and demographic data were used to identify patients eligible for primary prevention statin therapy. Statin prescription status was extracted from the electronic health record, and multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between statin prescription and age, gender, race, ethnicity, and other clinical and demographic covariables. In 7,550 patients eligible for primary prevention statin therapy, 3,994 (52.9%) were prescribed statins on at least 1 visit. Statin prescription was highest in patients with diabetes mellitus (73.6%) and with a 10-year ASCVD risk \u226520% (60.6%) and was lowest for those with a 10-year ASCVD risk between 5% and 7.5% (18.7%). Compared with those never prescribed statins, patients prescribed statins were less likely to be women, mainly driven by lower statin prescription rates for women with diabetes. In a fully adjusted model, women remained less likely to be prescribed statin therapy (adjusted odds ratios 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.88). In conclusion, primary prevention statin therapy remains underutilized.",

Despite this progress, a persistent gap remains between stated public health targets and achieved blood pressure control rates. Many factors may be important contributors to the gap between population hypertension control goals and currently observed control levels. Among them is the extent to which patients adhere to prescribed treatment. The goal of this scientific statement is to summarize the current state of knowledge of the contribution of medication nonadherence to the national prevalence of poor blood pressure control, methods for measuring medication adherence and their associated challenges, risk factors for antihypertensive medication nonadherence, and strategies for improving adherence to antihypertensive medications at both the individual and health system levels.",

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been increasingly applied to promote medical regimen adherence as MBIs have been shown to improve patient-level barriers to adherence (i.e., depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment, stress). The purpose of this review is to investigate the state of research regarding MBIs targeting medication adherence in chronic illnesses and to identify evidence gaps to inform future studies.",

        "Abstract": "The coronavirus pandemic catalyzed a digital health transformation, placing renewed focus on using remote monitoring technologies to care for patients outside of hospitals. At NewYork-Presbyterian, the authors expanded remote monitoring infrastructure and developed a COVID-19 Hypoxia Monitoring program-a critical means through which discharged COVID-19 patients were followed and assessed, enabling the organization to maximize inpatient capacity at a time of acute bed shortage. The pandemic tested existing remote monitoring efforts, revealing numerous operating challenges including device management, centralized escalation protocols, and health equity concerns. The continuation of these programs required addressing these concerns while expanding monitoring efforts in ambulatory and transitions of care settings. Building on these experiences, this article offers insights and strategies for implementing remote monitoring programs at scale and improving the sustainability of these efforts. As virtual care becomes a patient expectation, the authors hope hospitals recognize the promise that remote monitoring holds in reenvisioning health care delivery.",

Research suggests that greater cardiac-related fear of recurrence (FoR) may be associated with higher nonadherence to cardiovascular medications and avoidance of physical activity.

        "Abstract": "The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends out-of-office blood pressure (BP) testing to exclude white coat hypertension prior to hypertension diagnosis. Despite improved availability and coverage of home and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (HBPM, ABPM), both are infrequently used to confirm diagnoses. We used the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) framework, a multi-step process for mapping barriers to theory-informed behavior change techniques, to develop a multi-component implementation strategy for increasing out-of-office BP testing for hypertension diagnosis. Informed by geographically diverse provider focus groups (n = 63) exploring barriers to out-of-office testing and key informant interviews (n = 12), a multi-disciplinary team (medicine, psychology, nursing) used rigorous mixed methods to develop, refine, locally adapt, and finalize intervention components. The purpose of this report is to describe the protocol of the Effects of a Multi-faceted intervention on Blood pRessure Actions in the primary Care Environment (EMBRACE) trial, a cluster randomized control trial evaluating whether a theory-informed multi-component strategy increased out-of-office testing for hypertension diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "Background Self-monitoring of blood pressure (SMBP) improves blood pressure (BP) outcomes at 12-months, but information is lacking on how SMBP affects hypertension care processes and longer-term BP outcomes. Methods and Results We pooled individual participant data from 4 randomized clinical trials of SMBP in the United Kingdom (combined n=2590) with varying intensities of support. Multivariable random effects regression was used to estimate the probability of antihypertensive intensification at 12\u00a0months for usual care versus SMBP. Using these data, we simulated 5-year BP control rates using a validated mathematical model. Trial participants were mostly older adults (mean age 66.6\u00a0years, SD 9.5), male (53.9%), and predominantly white (95.6%); mean baseline BP was 151.8/85.0\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg. Compared with usual care, the likelihood of antihypertensive intensification increased with both SMBP with feedback to patient or provider alone (odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.6) and with telemonitoring or self-management (3.3, 2.5-4.2). Over 5\u00a0years, we estimated 33.4% BP control (<140/90\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) with usual care (95% uncertainty interval 27.7%-39.4%). One year of SMBP with feedback to patient or provider alone achieved 33.9% (28.3%-40.3%) BP control and SMBP with telemonitoring or self-management 39.0% (33.1%-45.2%) over 5\u00a0years. If SMBP interventions and associated BP control processes were extended to 5\u00a0years, BP control increased to 52.4% (45.4%-59.8 %) and 72.1% (66.5%-77.6%), respectively. Conclusions One year of SMBP plus telemonitoring or self-management increases the likelihood of antihypertensive intensification and could improve BP control rates at 5\u00a0years; continuing SMBP for 5\u00a0years could further improve BP control.",

        "Abstract": "Blood pressure (BP) control rates among US adults taking antihypertensive medication have not increased over the past decade. Many adults require 2 or more classes of antihypertensive medication to achieve guideline-recommended BP goals, but the proportion of US adults taking antihypertensive medication monotherapy, versus combination therapy, has not been quantified using contemporary data. We analyzed data from 2005 to 2008, 2009 to 2012, and 2013 to 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to determine trends in monotherapy and combinations of antihypertensive medication classes among US adults age \u226520 years with hypertension taking antihypertensive medication (n=7837). The proportion of US adults taking antihypertensive medication with uncontrolled BP (ie, systolic BP \u2265140 or diastolic BP \u226590 mm\u2009Hg) was 32.3%, 30.2%, and 31.0% in 2005 to 2008, 2009 to 2012, and 2013 to 2016, respectively (",

        "Abstract": "Recent evidence suggests clinical equipoise for managing transient ischaemic attack and minor stroke (TIAMS) either via discharge from the emergency department (ED) with rapid outpatient follow-up or inpatient admission. Understanding patient preferences may guide decision-making around disposition after TIAMS that can lead to higher patient satisfaction and adherence. Psychological distress, particularly a sense of vulnerability (eg, 'threat perception') is associated with adverse psychological outcomes following TIAMS and may influence patient disposition preference. We hypothesised patients with higher threat perceptions in the ED would prefer inpatient admission versus early discharge with rapid outpatient follow-up.",

        "Abstract": "As many as 1 in 8 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the ACS, and ACS-induced PTSD may increase secondary cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, prior studies have been small and underpowered to test plausible behavioral or biological mechanisms of the hypothesized PTSD-secondary CVD risk association. In this paper, we describe the design and methods of a large prospective observational cohort study to estimate the prognostic significance of ACS-induced PTSD, mechanisms for its association with CVD risk, and emergency department (ED) factors that may increase PTSD risk, in a cohort of patients evaluated for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the ED of a large, urban academic medical center.",

        "Abstract": "Adherence to chronic disease medication regimens depends in part on successful self-regulation. However, the overall benefit of interventions targeting self-regulatory mechanisms is not well-understood. Accordingly, we conducted a meta-review of meta-analyses assessing the effect of interventions targeting self-regulation on medication adherence. For this meta-review, meta-analyses appearing between January 2006 and March 2019 were eligible if they included experimental trials that assessed the effect of an intervention targeting self-regulation on adherence to chronic disease medication. A systematic literature search of multiple databases for published and unpublished literature identified 16,001 abstracts. Twelve meta-analyses met eligibility criteria and had variable quality according to AMSTAR 2 item completion (",

        "Abstract": "Experts have expressed concerns that patients with chronic conditions are being excessively excluded from cancer randomized clinical trials (RCTs), limiting generalizability. Accordingly, we queried clinicaltrials.gov to determine the extent to which patients with chronic conditions were excluded from phase III cancer trials, using National Cancer Institute-sponsored breast cancer RCTs as a test case. Two physicians independently coded for the presence of 19 prevalent chronic conditions within eligibility criteria. They also coded for exclusions based on performance status and vague criteria that could have broadly excluded patients with chronic conditions. The search identified 58 RCTs, initiated from 1993 to 2012. Overall, 88% of trials had at least one exclusion for a chronic condition, performance status, or vague criterion. The three most commonly excluded conditions were chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. Our study demonstrated that patients with prevalent chronic conditions were commonly excluded from National Cancer Institute-sponsored RCTs.",

        "Abstract": "Depression is the leading cause of disability and a major cause of morbidity worldwide, with societal costs now upwards of 1 trillion dollars across the globe. Hence, extending current efforts to augment prevention outcomes is consistent with global public health interests. Although many prevention programs have been developed and have demonstrated efficacy, studies have yet to demonstrate that CBT is effective in preventing symptoms in populations at risk for developing depression induced by pharmacological substances. Using a randomized, controlled design, this pilot study reports on the feasibility and preliminary effects of a novel, guided symptom exposure augmented cognitive behavioral prevention intervention (GSE-CBT) in a sample diagnosed with Hepatitis C at risk for developing medication induced depression. Results demonstrated that the guided symptom exposure augmented CBT (GSE-CBT) was feasible in this population and was delivered with high integrity. Although not statistically different, we observed a pattern of lower depression levels in the GSE-CBT group versus those in the control group throughout. This pilot study demonstrates that a psychosocial prevention intervention is feasible for use in patients at risk for developing pharmacologically induced depression and that a guided symptom exposure augmented CBT protocol has the potential to prevent symptoms of depression that develop as a side effect to taking these medications. Results are preliminary and future studies should use larger samples and test the intervention in other populations.",

        "Title": "Measuring the multiple domains of medication nonadherence: findings from a Delphi survey of adherence experts.",
        "Abstract": "Consensus on a gold-standard measure of patient medication nonadherence has been elusive, in part because medication nonadherence involves multiple, distinct behaviors across three phases (initiation, implementation, and persistence). To assess these behaviors, multiple measurement approaches may be needed. The purpose of this study was to identify expert-recommended approaches to measuring nonadherence behaviors. Thirty medication nonadherence experts were e-mailed two consecutive surveys. In both, respondents rated their agreement with definitions of nonadherence behaviors and measurement approaches. In the second survey, respondents rated the suitability of each measurement approach for assessing each behavior and identified the optimal measurement approach for each behavior. Consensus was achieved for eight patient medication nonadherence behaviors: not filling initial prescription and not taking first dose (noninitiation); refilling prescription late, missing doses, taking extra doses, taking doses at wrong time, and improperly administering medication (incorrect implementation); and discontinuing medication early (nonpersistence). Consensus was achieved for seven measurement approaches: self-report, prescription fill data, pill count, drug levels, electronic drug monitoring (EDM), smart technology, and direct observation. Self-report questionnaires were most commonly rated \"at least somewhat suitable\" for measuring behaviors. EDM was rated as optimal for measuring missing doses, taking extra doses, and taking doses at the wrong time. Prescription fill data were rated as optimal for not filling initial prescription, refilling late, and discontinuing. Direct observation was rated as optimal for measuring improper administration. Suitable and optimal measurement approaches varied across nonadherence behaviors. Researchers should select the measurement approach best suited to assessing the behavior(s) targeted in their research.",

        "Abstract": "Previous evidence suggests modest improvements in antihypertensive medication adherence occurred from 2007 to 2012 among US adults \u226565 years of age. Whether adherence improved over time among adults <65 years of age is unknown. We assessed trends in antihypertensive medication nonpersistence and low adherence among 379\u2009658 commercially insured adults <65 years of age initiating treatment in 2007-2014 using MarketScan claims. Nonpersistence was defined as having no days of medication available to take during the final 90 days of the 365 days following initiation. Among beneficiaries who were persistent to treatment, low adherence was defined by having antihypertensive medication available to take for <80% of the days in the 365 days following initiation (ie, proportion of days covered <80%). In 2007 and 2014, 23.3% and 23.5% of patients were nonpersistent to treatment, respectively, and 42.3% and 40.2% had low adherence, respectively. The relative risks for nonpersistence and low adherence were lower among beneficiaries initiating treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (0.95; 95% CI, 0.94-0.97 and 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.98, respectively), angiotensin receptor blocker (0.86; 95% CI, 0.85-0.88 and 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97-1.00, respectively), or multiclass regimen (0.82; 95% CI, 0.80-0.84 and 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86-0.89, respectively), prescribed 90-day versus 30-day prescriptions (0.67; 95% CI, 0.66-0.68 and 0.70; 95% CI, 0.69-0.71, respectively), or who received medications by mail versus at the pharmacy (0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.95 and 0.90; 95% CI, 0.88-0.92, respectively). In conclusion, several modifiable factors were associated with lower rates of both antihypertensive medication nonpersistence and low adherence among adults <65 years of age initiating treatment in 2007-2014.",

The field of health psychology may benefit from evaluating the temporal characteristics of depression's associations with common diseases, and from determining whether depression is a central connector in multimorbid disease clusters. The present review addresses these issues by focusing on 4 of the most prevalent diseases: hypertension, ischemic heart disease, arthritis, and diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) induced by life-threatening medical events has been associated with adverse physical and mental health outcomes, but it is unclear whether early interventions to prevent the onset of PTSD after these events are efficacious. We conducted a systematic review to address this need. We searched six biomedical electronic databases from database inception to October 2018. Eligible studies used randomized designs, evaluated interventions initiated within 3 months of potentially traumatic medical events, included adult participants, and did not have high risk of bias. The 21 included studies (N\u2009=\u20094,486) assessed a heterogeneous set of interventions after critical illness (9), cancer diagnosis (8), heart disease (2), and cardiopulmonary surgery (2). Fourteen psychological, 2 pharmacological, and 5 other-type interventions were assessed. Four of the psychological interventions emphasizing cognitive behavioral therapy or meaning-making, 1 other-type palliative care intervention, and 1 pharmacological-only intervention (hydrocortisone administration) were efficacious at reducing PTSD symptoms relative to control. One early, in-hospital counseling intervention was less efficacious at lowering PTSD symptoms than an active control. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity prevented quantitative pooling of data. While several promising interventions were identified, strong evidence of efficacy for any specific early PTSD intervention after medical events is currently lacking.",

Psychiatric disorders present special adherence considerations, notably an altered capacity for decision making and the increased street value of controlled substances. A wide range of interventions designed to improve adherence in mental health and substance use disorders have been studied; recently, many have incorporated information technology (eg, mobile phone apps, electronic pill dispensers, and telehealth). Many intervention components have been studied across different disorders. Furthermore, many interventions incorporate multiple components, making it difficult to evaluate the effect of individual components in isolation.",

        "Abstract": "The enduring somatic threat (EST) model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to life-threatening medical events suggests that PTSD-like symptoms represent patients' sensitization to cues of ongoing threat in the body. In this article, we review research on the prevalence and consequences of such reactions in cardiovascular disease patients, discuss early tests of the EST model, and then report a new test of the EST model in 143 patients enrolled during their first acute coronary syndrome (ACS; i.e., non-ST elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina-colloquially, \"heart attack\"). Invasive coronary revascularization procedures are commonly used to reduce secondary ACS risk and may reduce patients' EST, as revascularized patients often report being \"cured.\" We assessed ACS patients' initial threat perceptions during emergency department (ED) evaluation and followed them for 1 month for PTSD symptoms (specific for ACS, by telephone). We compared PTSD symptoms in participants who were revascularized (n = 65), catheterized but not revascularized (n = 35), and medically managed (n = 43). PTSD symptoms were lower for revascularized versus medically managed participants (B = -5.32, 95% confidence interval [-9.77, -0.87]), t(98.19) = -2.37, p = .020. In a multiple regression model adjusted for clinical and psychosocial covariates, the interaction of threat perception in the ED and ACS management group was significant (greater ED threat predicted greater 1-month PTSD symptoms only in medically managed participants). These findings offer further support for the EST model and suggest that psychological interventions to preempt patients' development of EST should be considered in the hospital.

        "Title": "Nausea in the peri-traumatic period is associated with prospective risk for PTSD symptom development.",
        "Abstract": "While nausea often develops following exposure to trauma, little is known regarding the relationship between peri-traumatic nausea and prospective risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We examined the association between peri-traumatic nausea and PTSD symptom development in three independent cohorts. Participants were recruited from (1) the Emergency Departments (ED) at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, GA, (2) from multiple other ED sites in the TRYUMPH Research Network, and (3) from the ED during evaluation for suspected acute coronary syndrome in the REACH cohort. Administration of IV ondansetron, the most predominant antiemetic used at GMH, was used as a surrogate marker for nausea in the initial GMH cohort; nausea was then directly assessed in the internal validation at GMH, and within the replication TRYUMPH Research Network and REACH cohorts. In the GMH cohort (N\u2009=\u2009363), ondansetron administration was associated with increased 1- and 3-month posttrauma PTSD symptoms in adjusted models (all p's\u2009<\u20090.05). In the GMH internal validation, nausea significantly predicted 1 month (p\u2009=\u20090.009; n\u2009=\u200968) and 3 month (p\u2009=\u20090.029; n\u2009=\u200954) PTSD symptoms. In the TRYUMPH cohort (N\u2009=\u20091846), patient reported nausea in the ED was significantly associated with increased PTSD symptoms (p\u2009=\u20090.009) in adjusted models. In the REACH cohort (N\u2009=\u2009758), peri-traumatic nausea was associated with PTSD symptom severity at the 1-month follow-up in adjusted models (p's\u2009\u2264\u20090.008). The current prospective data from three independent cohorts suggest that peri-traumatic nausea is a prospective predictor of PTSD symptom development. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanistic role of nausea as an intermediate phenotype of PTSD risk.",

        "Abstract": "Background Obtaining out-of-clinic blood pressure ( BP ) measurements to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension is recommended before initiating treatment. There are few empiric data available on the number of measurements required to reliably estimate BP on home BP monitoring ( HBPM ). Methods and Results We analyzed data from 316 community-dwelling adults not taking antihypertensive medication from the IDH (Improving the Detection of Hypertension) study who performed HBPM for 14\u00a0days. The reliability of home BP measurements was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient and as the percentage of participants with an absolute difference in home BP <10\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg between weeks. The reliability of home hypertension status was assessed by the \u03ba statistic. In the IDH study, 13.6% of participants had clinic hypertension and 18.0% had home hypertension. Mean home systolic and diastolic BP exhibited excellent reliability and sufficient agreement using the average of 2 morning and 2 evening BP readings for a minimum of 2\u00a0days of HBPM and a single morning and single evening or 2 morning BP readings for a minimum of 3\u00a0days. For diagnosing home hypertension, there was good agreement with a minimum of 3\u00a0days of HBPM using the average of 2 morning and 2 evening measurements or a single morning and single evening BP reading. A greater number of days was required for the other HBPM strategies. Conclusions Using the average of morning and evening readings, 3\u00a0days of HBPM are needed to reliably estimate mean home BP and diagnose out-of-clinic hypertension.",

        "Abstract": "Guidelines recommend measuring out-of-clinic blood pressure (BP) to identify masked hypertension (MHT) defined by out-of-clinic BP in the hypertensive range among individuals with clinic-measured BP not in the hypertensive range. The aim of this study was to determine the overlap between ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and home BP monitoring (HBPM) for the detection of MHT. We analyzed data from 333 community-dwelling adults not taking antihypertensive medication with clinic BP <140/90 mm Hg in the IDH study (Improving the Detection of Hypertension). Any MHT was defined by the presence of daytime MHT (mean daytime BP \u2265135/85 mm Hg), 24-hour MHT (mean 24-hour BP \u2265130/80 mm Hg), or nighttime MHT (mean nighttime BP \u2265120/70 mm Hg). Home MHT was defined as mean BP \u2265135/85 mm Hg on HBPM. The prevalence of MHT was 25.8% for any MHT and 11.1% for home MHT. Among participants with MHT on either ABPM or HBPM, 29.5% had MHT on both ABPM and HBPM; 61.1% had MHT only on ABPM; and 9.4% of participants had MHT only on HBPM. After multivariable adjustment and compared with participants without MHT on ABPM and HBPM, those with MHT on both ABPM and HBPM and only on ABPM had a higher left ventricular mass index (mean difference [SE], 12.7 [2.9] g/m",

        "Abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after acute medical events is associated with medication nonadherence. The mechanisms of PTSD-related nonadherence are poorly understood. We tested whether patients with elevated PTSD symptoms induced by suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were more likely to have aversive cognitions towards cardiovascular medications. We enrolled a consecutive cohort of patients who presented to the emergency department with suspected ACS. One month after discharge, ACS-induced PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PTSD Checklist (PCL-S), and patients were asked \"how often did\" (1) \"you miss your heart medication because you did not want to be reminded about your heart problem\"; (2) \"thinking about your heart medication make you feel nervous or anxious\"; and (3) \"thinking about your heart medication make you think about your risk for future heart problems.\" Logistic regression was used to determine the association between elevated PTSD symptoms and each aversive cognition, adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, depression, and ACS status. Of 424 patients included, 15.8% had elevated PTSD symptoms (PCL-S\u00a0\u2265\u00a034). In adjusted analyses, higher PCL-S scores were associated with missing medications to avoid reminders of heart disease (OR 1.22 per 5-point PCL-S increase, 95%CI 1.07-1.40), as well as anxiety (OR 1.34, 95%CI 1.19-1.51) and thoughts of future risk (OR 1.19, 95%CI 1.08-1.32) when thinking about cardiovascular medications. We concluded that patients with elevated PTSD symptoms following suspected ACS were more likely to report aversive cognitions about their cardiovascular medications, suggesting that medications can act as traumatic reminders of the cardiac event and ongoing risk in this group.",

        "Abstract": "Medication nonadherence contributes to morbidity/mortality, but adherence interventions yield small and inconsistent effects. Understanding the mechanisms underlying initiation and maintenance of adherence could improve interventions. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) support adherence research, but it is unclear whether existing NIH-funded research incorporates mechanisms. We conducted a systematic review to determine the proportion of NIH-funded adherence trials that have tested hypothesized mechanisms of intervention effects. We included randomized and quasi-randomized NIH-funded trials with medication adherence in adults as the primary outcome. Studies were identified by searching electronic databases from inception to 6/2016, references, and clinicaltrials.gov. Two of 18 (11%) NIH-funded trials tested a hypothesized mechanism of an intervention's effect on medication adherence. Another 44 studies with medication adherence as a secondary outcome were described in protocol form, and are either ongoing or never published results, but none mentioned mechanism tests. Overall, 3% of NIH-funded trials with adherence as an outcome conducted, or plan to conduct, tests of behavior change mechanisms. These results mirror previous findings that very few studies of behavior change interventions actually test the mechanism by which the intervention is hypothesized to improve health behaviors. We must understand mechanisms if we are to improve the effectiveness of interventions.",

In small studies, PTH levels have been associated with changes in cardiac conduction and repolarization. Changes in the corrected QT interval (QTc) in particular are thought to be mediated by the effect of PTH on serum calcium. There is limited evidence to suggest PTH may affect cardiac physiology independent of its effects on serum calcium, but there is even less data linking PTH to changes in electrical conduction and repolarization independent of serum calcium.",

Our goal was to determine the most important barriers to primary care providers' ordering ambulatory and home BP monitoring in the United States. We enrolled 63 primary care providers into nominal group panels in which participants iteratively listed and ranked barriers to ambulatory and home BP monitoring. Top-ranked barriers to ambulatory BP monitoring were challenges in accessing testing, costs of testing, concerns about the willingness or ability of patients to successfully complete tests, and concerns about the accuracy and benefits of testing. Top-ranked barriers to home BP monitoring were concerns about compliance with the correct test protocol, accuracy of tests results, out-of-pocket costs of home BP devices, and time needed to instruct patients on home BP monitoring protocol. Efforts to increase the use of ambulatory and home BP monitoring by primary care providers in the United States should prioritize increasing the financial and personnel resources available for testing and addressing provider concerns about patients' ability to conduct high-quality tests.",

        "Abstract": "Wrist-based accelerometers are increasingly used to assess physical activity (PA) in population-based studies; however, cut-points to translate wrist-based accelerometer counts into PA intensity categories are still needed. The purpose of this study was to determine wrist-based cut-points for moderate- and vigorous-intensity ambulatory PA in adults for the Actical accelerometer. Healthy adults (n\u00a0=\u00a024) completed a four-phase treadmill exercise protocol (1.9, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.2\u00a0mph) while wearing an Actical accelerometer on their wrist. Metabolic equivalent of task (MET) levels were assessed by indirect calorimetry. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were generated to determine accelerometer counts that maximised sensitivity and specificity for classification of moderate (\u22653 METs) and vigorous (>6 METs) ambulatory activity. The area under the ROC curves to discriminate moderate- and vigorous-intensity ambulatory activity were 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90-0.97; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94-0.99; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), respectively. The identified cut-point for moderate-intensity ambulatory activity was 1031 counts per minute, which had a corresponding sensitivity and specificity of 85.6% and 87.5%, respectively. The identified cut-point for vigorous intensity ambulatory activity was 3589 counts per minute, which had a corresponding sensitivity and specificity of 88.0% and 98.7%, respectively. This study established intensity-specific cut-points for wrist-based wear of the Actical accelerometer which are recommended for quantification of moderate- and vigorous-intensity ambulatory activity.",

        "Abstract": "The understanding of how stress influences health behavior can provide insights into developing healthy lifestyle interventions. This understanding is traditionally attained through observational studies that examine associations at a population level. This nomothetic approach, however, is fundamentally limited by the fact that the environment- person milieu that constitutes stress exposure and experience can vary substantially between individuals, and the modifiable elements of these exposures and experiences are individual-specific. With recent advances in smartphone and sensing technologies, it is now possible to conduct idiographic assessment in users' own environment, leveraging the full-range observations of actions and experiences that result in differential response to naturally occurring events. The aim of this paper is to explore the hypothesis that an ideographic N-of-1 model can better capture an individual's stress- behavior pathway (or the lack thereof) and provide useful person-specific predictors of exercise behavior.",

        "Abstract": "We examined baseline data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) to investigate whether medication adherence, measured by the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8), was associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and whether MMAS-8 score and number of antihypertensive medications interacted in influencing SBP. A total of 8435 SPRINT participants were included: 21.2% had low adherence (MMAS-8: <6); 40.0% had medium adherence (6 to <8); and 38.8% had high adherence (8). SBP was <140\u00a0mm Hg in 54.6%; 140-160\u00a0mm Hg in 36.6%; and >160\u00a0mm Hg in 8.8%. In multivariable regression, medium vs. low adherence weakly associated with lower SBP (odds ratio: 1.17; confidence interval: 1.04, 1.31). SPRINT eligibility criteria should be considered when interpreting results. Efforts to understand and enhance adherence are crucial to improve population health, and using self-report instruments might be considered for predicting treatment adherence and response in future efficacy trials and for identifying patients for adherence support in clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "Low antihypertensive medication adherence is common. During recent years, the impact of low medication adherence on increased morbidity and healthcare costs has become more recognized, leading to interventions aimed at improving adherence. We analyzed a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries initiating antihypertensive medication between 2007 and 2012 to assess whether reductions occurred in discontinuation and low adherence. Discontinuation was defined as having no days of antihypertensive medication supply for the final 90 days of the 365 days after initiation. Low adherence was defined as having a proportion of days covered <80% during the 365 days after initiation among beneficiaries who did not discontinue treatment. Between 2007 and 2012, 41\u2009135 Medicare beneficiaries in the 5% sample initiated antihypertensive medication. Discontinuation was stable during the study period (21.0% in 2007 and 21.3% in 2012; P-trend=0.451). Low adherence decreased from 37.4% in 2007 to 31.7% in 2012 (P-trend<0.001). After multivariable adjustment, the relative risk of low adherence for beneficiaries initiating treatment in 2012 versus in 2007 was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.92). Low adherence was more common among racial/ethnic minorities, beneficiaries with Medicaid buy-in (an indicator of low income), and those with polypharmacy, and was less common among females, beneficiaries initiating antihypertensive medication with multiple classes or a 90-day prescription fill, with dementia, a history of stroke, and those who reached the Medicare Part D coverage gap in the previous year. In conclusion, low adherence to antihypertensive medication has decreased among Medicare beneficiaries; however, rates of discontinuation and low adherence remain high.",

        "Abstract": "Low adherence to antihypertensive medication has been hypothesized to increase visit-to-visit variability (VVV) of blood pressure (BP). We assessed the association between antihypertensive medication adherence and VVV of BP in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). VVV of BP was calculated using SD independent of mean, SD, and average real variability across study visits conducted 6 to 28 months after randomization. Participants who reported taking <80% of their antihypertensive medication at \u22651 study visits were categorized as nonadherent. Participants were followed up for cardiovascular events and mortality after the assessment of adherence and VVV of BP. SD independent of mean of BP was higher for nonadherent (n=2912) versus adherent (n=16\u2009878) participants; 11.4\u00b14.9 versus 10.5\u00b14.5 for systolic BP; 6.8\u00b12.8 versus 6.2\u00b12.6 for diastolic BP (each P<0.001). SD independent of mean of BP remained higher among nonadherent than among adherent participants after multivariable adjustment (0.8 [95% confidence interval, 0.7-1.0] higher for systolic BP and 0.4 [95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.5] higher for diastolic BP]. SD and average real variability of systolic BP and diastolic BP were also higher among nonadherent than among adherent participants. Adjustment for nonadherence did not explain the association of VVV of BP with higher fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or mortality risk. In conclusion, improving medication adherence may lower VVV of BP. However, VVV of BP is associated with cardiovascular outcomes independent of medication adherence.",

        "Abstract": "Primary care providers are increasingly involved in the management of patients with mental disorders, particularly as integrated models of care emerge. The recent publication of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) represents a shift in the classification of several mental disorders commonly encountered by primary care providers. With the advent of ICD-10 and the movement toward diagnostic specificity, it is crucial that primary care providers understand the rationale behind these changes. This paper provides an overview of the changes in the classification of mental disorders in DSM-5, a description of how these changes relate to frequently used screening tools in the primary care setting, and a critique of how these changes will affect mental health practice from a primary care perspective.",

        "Abstract": "The notion that psychological states can influence physical health is hardly new, and perhaps nowhere has the mind-body connection been better studied than in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recently, large prospective epidemiologic studies and smaller basic science studies have firmly established a connection between CVD and several psychological conditions, including depression, chronic psychological stress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety. In addition, numerous clinical trials have been conducted to attempt to prevent or lessen the impact of these conditions on cardiovascular health. In this article, we review studies connecting depression, stress/PTSD, and anxiety to CVD, focusing on findings from the last 5 years. For each mental health condition, we first examine the epidemiologic evidence establishing a link with CVD. We then describe studies of potential underlying mechanisms and finally discuss treatment trials and directions for future research.",

        "Abstract": "Medication nonadherence is a major cause of uncontrolled hypertension, but clinicians are poor at judging adherence, and the gold standard for measuring adherence, electronic monitoring, is rarely available in clinical settings. Self-report questionnaires (SRQs), by contrast, are inexpensive, easy to administer, and hence, may be useful for 'diagnosing' nonadherence. In this study, we evaluated the validity of two commonly used medication adherence SRQs among patients with uncontrolled hypertension, using electronic pillbox measurement as the gold standard.",

        "Title": "A test of the diathesis-stress model in the emergency department: who develops PTSD after an acute coronary syndrome?",
        "Abstract": "Most acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients first present to the emergency department (ED). Patients who present to overcrowded EDs develop more posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms due to the ACS than do patients who present to less crowded EDs, but no research has indicated whether some patients may be more vulnerable to the effects of ED crowding than others. In an observational cohort study, we tested whether depressed patients developed more ACS-induced PTSD symptoms under conditions of ED overcrowding than patients who had never been depressed. We conducted psychiatric interviews for current and past depression in 189 ACS patients admitted through the ED within a week of hospitalization, and screened for PTSD symptoms 1 month later using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised. The sum of ED admissions for the 12\u00a0h prior to and 12\u00a0h after each participant's admission was categorized into tertiles for analysis. In a 3 (ED crowding tertile) by 3 (never, past, current depression) analysis of covariance adjusted for demographic and clinical factors, we found significant effects for ED crowding, depression status, and their interaction (all p's\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Mean PTSD scores were significantly higher (p\u00a0=\u00a0.005) for participants who were currently depressed and were treated during times of high ED crowding [25.38, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a016.18-34.58], or had a history of depression [10.74, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a06.86-14.62], relative to all other participants, who scored 5.6 or less. These results suggest that depressed ACS patients may be most vulnerable to the stress-inducing effects of ED crowding.",

The current study investigated these \"stress-model perceptions\" in stroke survivors regarding prevention of recurrent stroke and the influence of these perceptions on patients' stroke risk factor control. Stroke and transient ischemic attack survivors (N=600) participated in an in-person interview in which they were asked about their beliefs regarding control of future stroke; BP and cholesterol were measured directly after the interview. Counter to expectations, patients who endorsed a \"stress-model\" but not a \"medication-model\" of stroke prevention were in better control of their stroke risk factors (BP and cholesterol) than those who endorsed a medication-model but not a stress-model of stroke prevention (OR for poor control=.54, Wald statistic=6.07, p=.01). This result was not explained by between group differences in patients' reported medication adherence. The results have implications for theory and practice, regarding the role of stress belief models and acute cardiac events, compared to chronic hypertension.",

        "Abstract": "The revolution in cardiac care over the past two decades, characterized by emergent revascularization, drug eluting stents, anti-platelet medications, and advanced imaging has had little impact on overall ACS recurrence, or ACS prevention. The \"Perfect Storm\" refers to a confluence of events and processes, including atherosclerotic plaque, coronary flow dynamics, hemostatic and fibrinolytic function, metabolic and inflammatory conditions, neurohormonal dysregulation, and environmental events that give rise to, and result in an ACS event. In this article we illustrate the limits of the traditional main effect research model, giving a brief description of the current state of knowledge regarding the development of atherosclerotic plaque and the rupturing of these plaques that defines an ACS event. We then apply the Perfect Storm conceptualization to describe a program of research concerning a psychosocial vulnerability factor that contributes to increased risk of recurrent ACS and early mortality, and that has defied our efforts to identify underlying pathophysiology and successfully mount efforts to fully mitigate this risk.",

Finding novel methods to help patients improve their adherence to existing evidence-based cardiovascular drug therapies has enormous potential to improve health outcomes while potentially reducing health care costs. The goal of this report is to provide a review of the current understanding of adherence to cardiovascular medications from the point of view of prescribing clinicians and cardiovascular researchers. Key topics addressed include: (1) definitions of medication adherence; (2) prevalence and impact of non-adherence; (3) methods for assessing medication adherence; 4) reasons for poor adherence; and 5) approaches to improving adherence to cardiovascular medications. For each of these topics, the report seeks to identify important gaps in knowledge and opportunities for advancing the field of cardiovascular adherence research.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical research is the foundation for advancing the practice of medicine. However, the lack of seamless integration between clinical research and patient care workflow impedes recruitment efficiency, escalates research costs, and hence threatens the entire clinical research enterprise. Increased use of electronic health records (EHRs) holds promise for facilitating this integration but must surmount regulatory obstacles. Among the unintended consequences of current research oversight are barriers to accessing patient information for prescreening and recruitment, coordinating scheduling of clinical and research visits, and reconciling information about clinical and research drugs. We conclude that the EHR alone cannot overcome barriers in conducting clinical trials and comparative effectiveness research. Patient privacy and human subject protection policies should be clarified at the local level to exploit optimally the full potential of EHRs, while continuing to ensure participant safety. Increased alignment of policies that regulate the clinical and research use of EHRs could help fulfill the vision of more efficiently obtaining clinical research evidence to improve human health.",

        "Abstract": "The authors' objective was to gain a better understanding of minority patients' beliefs about hypertension and to use this understanding to develop a model to explain gaps in communication between patients and clinicians. Eighty-eight hypertensive black and Latino adults from 4 inner-city primary care clinics participated in focus groups to elucidate views on hypertension. Participants believed that hypertension was a serious illness in need of treatment. Participants' diverged from the medical model in their beliefs about the time-course of hypertension (believed hypertension was intermittent); causes of hypertension (believed stress, racism, pollution, and poverty were the important causes); symptoms of hypertension (believed hypertension was primarily present when symptomatic); and treatments for hypertension (preferred alternative treatments that reduced stress over prescription medications). Participants distrusted clinicians who prioritized medications that did not directly address their understanding of the causes or symptoms of hypertension. Patients' models of understanding chronic asymptomatic illnesses such as hypertension challenge the legitimacy of lifelong, pill-centered treatment. Listening to patients' beliefs about hypertension may increase trust, improve communication, and encourage better self-management of hypertension.",

        "Abstract": "Among patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), depression is highly prevalent and is associated with worse cardiovascular prognosis and lower quality of life. Treatments for depression in CVD patients produce modest, but clinically significant reductions in depressive symptoms and show promise for improving cardiovascular prognosis. While tricyclics should generally be avoided, antidepressants from multiple other classes appear to be safe in cardiac patients. A strategy of engaging patients in choosing medications or psychotherapy and then intensifying treatment to therapeutic goal appears to be more effective at reducing depression than single mode interventions. Recommendations for screening all CVD patients for depression may be premature given increased costs associated with screening and gaps in knowledge about the risk-benefit ratio of depression treatment in mild and moderately depressed patients.",

        "Abstract": "Approximately 15% of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to their ACS event. We assessed whether ACS-induced PTSD symptoms increase risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and all-cause mortality (ACM) in an observational cohort study of 247 patients (aged 25-93 years; 45% women) hospitalized for an ACS at one of 3 academic medical centers in New York and Connecticut between November 2003 and June 2005. Within 1 week of admission, patient demographics, Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score, Charlson comorbidity index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and depression status were obtained. At 1-month follow-up, ACS-induced PTSD symptoms were assessed with the Impact of Events Scale-Revised. The primary endpoint was combined MACE (hospitalization for myocardial infarction, unstable angina or urgent/emergency coronary revascularization procedures) and ACM, which were actively surveyed for 42 months after index event. Thirty-six (15%) patients had elevated intrusion symptoms, 32 (13%) elevated avoidance symptoms, and 21 (9%) elevated hyperarousal symptoms. Study physicians adjudicated 21 MACEs and 15 deaths during the follow-up period. In unadjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, and analyses adjusted for sex, age, clinical characteristics and depression, high intrusion symptoms were associated with the primary endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-9.02; p\u00a0=\u00a0.015). Avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms were not associated with the primary endpoint. The presence of intrusion symptoms is a strong and independent predictor of elevated risk for MACE and ACM, and should be considered in the risk stratification of ACS patients.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatitis C virus is a common bloodborne pathogen. Patient, provider, and health care system factors combine to constrain access to treatment and have led to low rates of treatment initiation and continuation among medically eligible individuals. Behavioral health comorbidity, which is common in the patient population, has historically been an exclusion criterion and is one such barrier to care. We implemented an interdisciplinary nurse-managed primary care-based hepatitis C evaluation and treatment program to address behavioral health needs concurrently in an effort to increase treatment initiation and continuation rates among comorbid individuals. We found no association between having a psychiatric or substance use history and treatment discontinuation in our patient cohort. Likewise, there was no association in our cohort between becoming depressed or anxious while undergoing treatment and treatment discontinuation. The results of our study concur with others that have shown that addressing behavioral health comorbidities concurrently with hepatitis C evaluation and treatment may improve treatment continuation rates among comorbid patients, thereby helping to remove barriers to treatment of chronic hepatitis C.",

        "Abstract": "Although depression is clearly associated with increased mortality after acute myocardial infarction, there is a paucity of data examining the impact of depression on patients with unstable angina (UA). We analyzed the relation between depressive symptoms and all-cause mortality in patients with UA who were enrolled in a prospective multicenter study of depression and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) within 1 week of the ACS event, and patients were selected for a BDI score 0 to 4 or \u2265 10. Our sample included 209 patients with UA, with 104 (50%) having a BDI score \u2265 10. Proportional hazards analyses adjusted for variables including left ventricular ejection fraction, Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score, and Charlson co-morbidity index. In multivariable analyses, a BDI score \u2265 10 was associated with increased risk of 42-month all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 3.46, p = 0.008) compared to a BDI score 0 to 4. In conclusion, our results confirm and extend previous evidence linking depression to worse outcomes in UA and suggest that interventions that address depression may be worth examining across the spectrum of risk in ACS.",

        "Abstract": "Persistent elevation of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) has been associated with an increased risk of recurrent cardiac events after acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Conflicting evidence is available regarding whether aspirin can reduce CRP after ACS. We investigated whether the dosage and adherence to aspirin was associated with the CRP level 3 months after ACS. Adherence to aspirin was monitored for 3 months in a cohort of 105 patients enrolled within 1 week of an ACS using an electronic chip stored in the pill bottle cap. The CRP level was measured at baseline and 3 months. Logistic regression analysis was used to test whether poor adherence to aspirin and a lower aspirin dosage were associated with increased CRP levels, controlling for age, ACS type, disease co-morbidity, baseline CRP level, use of clopidogrel and statins, depressive symptoms, smoking, and adherence to other medications. Aspirin adherence was inversely correlated with the CRP level at 3 months (Spearman's r = -0.36, p < 0.001). In the adjusted model, every 10% decrease in aspirin adherence was associated with a 1.7 increased risk (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.4) of a CRP level of \u2265 3.0 mg/L at 3 months. Low-dose aspirin was associated with a 7.1 increased risk (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 33.3) of a CRP level of \u2265 3.0 mg/L. The Charlson co-morbidity index, depressive symptoms, and baseline CRP level were also predictive of a CRP level of \u2265 3.0 mg/L at 3 months. The association between aspirin adherence and CRP level was not attenuated by controlling for other risk-reducing behaviors. In conclusion, a strong association was found between aspirin adherence and the CRP level after an ACS.",
