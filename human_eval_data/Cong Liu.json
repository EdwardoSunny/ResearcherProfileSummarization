        "Abstract": "Sand solidification of earth-rock dams is the key to flood discharge capacity and collapse prevention of earth-rock dams. It is urgent to find an economical, environmentally friendly, and durable sand solidification technology. However, the traditional grouting reinforcement method has some problems, such as high costs, complex operations, and environmental pollution. Enzyme-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (EICP) is an anti-seepage reinforcement technology emerging in recent years with the characteristics of economy, environmental protection, and durability. The erosion resistance and shear strength of earth-rock dams solidified by EICP need further verification. In this paper, EICP-solidified standard sand is taken as the research object, and EICP-cemented standard sand is carried out by a consolidated undrained triaxial test. A two-stage pouring method is adopted to pour samples, and the effects of dry density, cementation times, standing time, and confining pressure on the shear strength of cemented standard sand are emphatically analyzed. The relationship between cohesion, internal friction angle, and CaCO",

        "Abstract": "Gel-electromembrane extraction (G-EME) is an increasingly popular green variant of electromembrane extraction (EME). However, the electroendosmosis (EEO) flow associated with G-EME greatly limits the development of this technology. To address this challenge, the current study proposed the concept of confined G-EME (CG-EME), and a three-dimensional-printed modular device was elaborately designed to realize this concept. The device blocked the EEO flow by limiting the volume of the sample compartment. Moreover, the mesh structure at the bottom of the extraction module helps to prepare thin and stable gel films, which enhance the electromigration driving force and shorten the migration path. In addition, polar oligonucleotides, a nucleic acid analyte, were extracted for the first time to prove the concept of CG-EME. After optimization, 62% of the oligonucleotides were extracted at 50 V voltage for 15 min using a 3 mm thick agarose (3%) gel film. Finally, the application capability of CG-EME was further demonstrated by recovering DNA primers and isolating disease biomarkers (miRNA-181b) from real samples. In combination with CG-EME and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis, the upregulation of miRNA-181b expression in the peripheral blood of patients with schizophrenia was observed. In conclusion, this study proposes CG-EME to diminish EEO and push EME into the clinical field to isolate nucleic acid biomarkers, which will greatly expand the application scenarios of this emerging technology.",

        "Abstract": "With the continuous advancements of laparoscopic techniques, many surgeons have enhanced the feasibility and safety of this approach for carefully selected patients. This study aims to offer a comprehensive account of the technical aspects and surgical outcomes associated with laparoscopic anatomical right hepatectomy, explicitly utilizing a four-incision anterior approach. The surgical procedure involved several maneuvers, including blocking the Glissonean pedicle, ligation of the right hepatic artery, right branch of the portal vein, and the right hepatic duct, removal of the liver parenchyma along the ischemic line, and determination of the liver section based on four anatomical landmarks: the right anterior Glissonian pedicle, middle hepatic vein, root of the right hepatic vein, and retrohepatic inferior vena cava. The article provides clear visualization of these anatomical landmarks following right hepatectomy. Proper patient positioning and precise incision placement are crucial factors for ensuring the success of the laparoscopic right anterior hepatectomy procedure. The separation of the extrahepatic Glissonean pedicle at the liver hilum to determine the hepatic resection ischemia line, as well as the identification of liver sections using four anatomical landmarks are essential steps in the liver resection process. The laparoscopic anatomical right hepatectomy using a four-incision anterior approach was performed smoothly, with standard intraoperative techniques completed. Measures are in place to address any complications that may arise during the surgery.",

        "Abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are important for many biological processes, but predicting them from sequence data remains challenging. Existing deep learning models often cannot generalize to proteins not present in the training set and do not provide uncertainty estimates for their predictions. To address these limitations, we present TUnA, a Transformer-based uncertainty-aware model for PPI prediction. TUnA uses ESM-2 embeddings with Transformer encoders and incorporates a Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process. TUnA achieves state-of-the-art performance and, importantly, evaluates uncertainty for unseen sequences. We demonstrate that TUnA's uncertainty estimates can effectively identify the most reliable predictions, significantly reducing false positives. This capability is crucial in bridging the gap between computational predictions and experimental validation.",

        "Abstract": "Translating RNA-seq into clinical diagnostics requires ensuring the reliability and cross-laboratory consistency of detecting clinically relevant subtle differential expressions, such as those between different disease subtypes or stages. As part of the Quartet project, we present an RNA-seq benchmarking study across 45 laboratories using the Quartet and MAQC reference samples spiked with ERCC controls. Based on multiple types of 'ground truth', we systematically assess the real-world RNA-seq performance and investigate the influencing factors involved in 26 experimental processes and 140 bioinformatics pipelines. Here we show greater inter-laboratory variations in detecting subtle differential expressions among the Quartet samples. Experimental factors including mRNA enrichment and strandedness, and each bioinformatics step, emerge as primary sources of variations in gene expression. We underscore the profound influence of experimental execution, and provide best practice recommendations for experimental designs, strategies for filtering low-expression genes, and the optimal gene annotation and analysis pipelines. In summary, this study lays the foundation for developing and quality control of RNA-seq for clinical diagnostic purposes.",

        "Title": "Effect of music therapy on anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients: systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "Abstract": "To systematically evaluate the intervention effect of music therapy on anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients. Randomised controlled trial (RCT) on music therapy for anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients was searched from 7 major databases, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, WOS, CNIC, Wanfang, and Wipro, spanning the period of library construction to 23 October 2023, and the literature screening of music therapy for anxiety or depression in breast cancer patients was carried out by 2 experimentalists, each of whom conducted a literature screening RCT independently of the other anxiety or depression in a RCT. Methodological quality was evaluated using the PEDro scale; GRADE profiler software for quality of evidence; and RevMan 5.4 was used for effect size merging and forest plots; publication bias tests and sensitivity analyses were performed using Stata 17.0; and standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI were used as the effect statistics. A total of 13 RCTs with 1326 subjects (aged 18-70\u00a0years) were included in the literature, with a mean PEDro score of 6.8, and the literature was overall of good methodological quality. Meta-analysis showed that music therapy improved anxiety in breast cancer patients (841 cases), with a combined effect size (SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.82, 95% CI [-\u20091.03, -\u20090.61] and P\u2009<\u20090.001); and improved depression in breast cancer patients (387 cases) with a combined effect size (SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.76, 95% CI [-\u20091.15, -\u20090.38], P\u2009<\u20090.001). Subgroup analyses showed that music intervention with off-site music (757 cases) and music choice of non-self-selected music (537 cases) had the best effect on anxiety improvement, with corresponding combined effect sizes (SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.88, P\u2009<\u20090.001; SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.83, P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively; followed by an intervention length of\u2009<\u200930\u00a0min (589 cases), a frequency of 2 times/day (382 cases), and intervention period of 2-3\u00a0weeks (101 cases) had the best effect on anxiety improvement, and the corresponding combined effect sizes were (SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.80, P\u2009<\u20090.001; SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.91, P\u2009<\u20090.001; SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20091.02, P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively; and the music selection was the choice of one's own favourite music among the expert recommendations (219 cases) (270 cases) had the best effect on the improvement of depressed mood, with combined effect sizes of (SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20091.15, P\u2009<\u20090.001; SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.71, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and music with an intervention duration of 30\u00a0min (287 cases), an intervention frequency of 1 time/day (348 cases), and an intervention period of 2-4\u00a0weeks (120 cases), respectively, with corresponding combined effect sizes of (SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.75, P\u2009<\u20090.001; SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.86, P\u2009<\u20090.001; SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20091.06, P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively. Music therapy can improve anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients, and the level of evidence is moderate. Although the heterogeneity between studies is high, which may lead to bias in the results, we explored the source of heterogeneity through subgroup and sensitivity analyses, providing a good evidence-based basis for clinical practice. The heterogeneity of anxiety and depression was explored by subgroup analysis, with anxiety due to music duration and music cycle; and depression due to intervention cycles and music duration. Sensitivity analyses also identified music duration and music cycle as contributing to the heterogeneity. Also, this study has some limitations since the included literature did not take into account the duration of the disease, education, and family economic status and did not categorize the age stages. This study found that music therapy improves anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients and the results can be used as a basis for clinical practice and researcher enquiry.

        "Abstract": "Numerous studies have reported critical roles for the gut microbiota in obesity. However, the specific microbes that causally contribute to obesity and the underlying mechanisms remain undetermined. Here, we conducted shotgun metagenomic sequencing in a Chinese cohort of 631 obese subjects and 374 normal-weight controls and identified a Megamonas-dominated, enterotype-like cluster enriched in obese subjects. Among this cohort, the presence of Megamonas and polygenic risk exhibited an additive impact on obesity. Megamonas rupellensis possessed genes for myo-inositol degradation, as demonstrated in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, and the addition of myo-inositol effectively inhibited fatty acid absorption in intestinal organoids. Furthermore, mice colonized with M.\u00a0rupellensis or E.\u00a0coli heterologously expressing the myo-inositol-degrading iolG gene exhibited enhanced intestinal lipid absorption, thereby leading to obesity. Altogether, our findings uncover roles for M.\u00a0rupellensis as a myo-inositol degrader that enhances lipid absorption and obesity, suggesting potential strategies for future obesity management.",

        "Abstract": "Dietary fiber (DF) cannot be digested and absorbed by the digestive tract, nor can it provide the energy needed to be burned for metabolic activities. Therefore, from the 1950s to the 1980s, DF received little attention in nutrition studies. With in-depth research and developments in global nutrition, people have gradually paid attention to the fact that DF occupies an essential position in the structure of nutrition, and it can ensure the healthy development of human beings. As early as 390 B.C., the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates proposed, \"Let your food be your medicine, and your medicine be your food\". This concept has been more systematically validated in modern scientific research, with numerous epidemiological studies showing that the dietary intake of DF-rich foods such as whole grains, root vegetables, legumes, and fruits has the potential to regulate the balance of the gut microbiota and thereby prevent diseases. However, the crosstalk between different types of DF and the gut microbiota is quite complex, and the effects on the organism vary. In this paper, we discuss research on DF and the gut microbiota and related diseases, aiming to understand the relationship between all three better and provide a reference basis for the risk reduction of related diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The changing climate poses a growing challenge to the population health. The objective of this study was to assess the association between ambient temperature and cause-specific mortality in Suzhou. Based on the non-accidental mortality data collected during 2008-2022 in Suzhou, China, this study utilized an individual-level case-crossover design to evaluate the associations of temperature with cause-specific mortality. We applied a distributed lag nonlinear model with a maximum lag of 14 days to account for lag effects. Mortality risk due to extreme cold (<2.5th percentile) and extreme heat (>97.5th percentile) was analyzed. A total of 634,530 non-accidental deaths were analyzed in this study. An inverse J-shaped exposure-response relationship was observed between ambient temperature and non-accidental mortality, with the minimum mortality temperature (MMT) at 29.1\u2103. The relative risk (RR) of mortality associated with extreme cold (2.5th percentile) was 1.37 [95\u202f% confidence interval (CI): 1.30, 1.44], higher than estimate of 1.09 (95\u202f%CI: 1.07, 1.11) for extreme heat (97.5th percentile) relative to the MMT. Heat effect lasted for 2-3 days, while cold effect could persist for almost 14 days. Higher mortality risk estimates were observed for cardiorespiratory deaths compared to total deaths, with statistically significant between-group differences. Consequently, this study provides first-hand evidence on the associations between ambient temperatures and mortality risks from various causes, which could help local government and policy-makers in designing targeted strategies and public health measures against the menace of climate change.",

        "Title": "CL429 enhances the renewal of intestinal stem cells by upregulating TLR2-YAP1.",
        "Abstract": "Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) play a crucial role in maintaining the equilibrium and regenerative potential of intestinal tissue, thereby ensuring tissue homeostasis and promoting effective tissue regeneration following injury. It has been proven that targeting Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can help prevent radiation-induced damage to the intestine. In this study, we established an intestinal injury model using IR and evaluated the effects of CL429 on ISC regeneration both in vivo and in vitro. Following radiation exposure, mice treated with CL429 showed a significant increase in survival rates (100% survival in the treated group compared to 54.54% in the control group). CL429 also showed remarkable efficacy in inhibiting radiation-induced intestinal damage and promoting ISC proliferation and regeneration. In addition, CL429 protected intestinal organoids against IR-induced injury. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing and Western blot analysis revealed the activation of the Wnt and Hippo signaling pathways by CL429. Specifically, we observed a significant upregulation of YAP1, a key transcription factor in the Hippo pathway, upon CL429 stimulation. Furthermore, knockdown of YAP1 significantly attenuated the radioprotective effect of CL429 on intestinal organoids, indicating that CL429-mediated intestinal radioprotection is dependent on YAP1. In addition, we investigated the relationship between TLR2 and YAP1 using TLR2 knockout mice, and our results showed that TLR2 knockout abolished the activation of CL429 on YAP1. Taken together, our study provides evidence supporting the role of CL429 in promoting ISC regeneration through activation of TLR2-YAP1. And further investigation of the interaction between TLRs and other signaling pathways may enhance our understanding of ISC regeneration after injury.",

Genetic mutations in lipid metabolism are causative for a subset of patients with Parkinsonism. The role of \u03b1-syn's lipid interactions in its function and aggregation is recognized, yet the specific lipids involved and how lipid metabolism issues trigger \u03b1-syn aggregation and neurodegeneration remain unclear. Here, we found that \u03b1-syn shows a preference for binding to lysophospholipids (LPLs), particularly targeting lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) without relying on electrostatic interactions. LPC is capable of maintaining \u03b1-syn in a compact conformation, significantly reducing its propensity to aggregate both ",

        "Abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) aggregation is closely associated with Parkinson's disease neuropathology. Physiologically, \u03b1-Syn promotes synaptic vesicle (SV) clustering and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex assembly. However, the underlying structural and molecular mechanisms are uncertain and it is not known whether this function affects the pathological aggregation of \u03b1-Syn. Here we show that the juxtamembrane region of vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2)-a component of the SNARE complex that resides on SVs-directly interacts with the carboxy-terminal region of \u03b1-Syn through charged residues to regulate \u03b1-Syn's function in clustering SVs and promoting SNARE complex assembly by inducing a multi-component condensed phase of SVs, \u03b1-Syn and other components. Moreover, VAMP2 binding protects \u03b1-Syn against forming aggregation-prone oligomers and fibrils in these condensates. Our results suggest a molecular mechanism that maintains \u03b1-Syn's function and prevents its pathological amyloid aggregation, the failure of which may lead to Parkinson's disease.",

        "Title": "Functional studies on tandem carbohydrate-binding modules of a multimodular enzyme possessing two catalytic domains.",
        "Abstract": "Although functional studies on carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) have been carried out extensively, the role of tandem CBMs in the enzyme containing multiple catalytic domains (CDs) is unclear. Here, we identified a multidomain enzyme (Lc25986) with a novel modular structure from lignocellulolytic bacterial consortium. It consists of a mannanase domain, two CBM65 domains (LcCBM65-1/LcCBM65-2), and an esterase domain. To investigate CBM function and domain interactions, full-length Lc25986 and its variants were constructed and used for enzymatic activity, binding, and bioinformatic analyses. The results showed that LcCBM65-1 and LcCBM65-2 both bind mannan and xyloglucan but not cellulose or \u03b2-1,3-1,4-glucan, which differs from the ligand specificity of reported CBM65s. Compared to LcCBM65-2, LcCBM65-1 showed a stronger ligand affinity and a preference for acetylation sites. Both CBM65s stimulated the enzymatic activities of their respective neighboring CDs against acetylated mannan, but did not contribute to the activities of the distal CDs. The time course of mannan hydrolysis indicated that the full-length Lc25986 was more effective in the complete degradation of mixed acetyl/non-acetyl substrates than the mixture of single-CD mutants. When acting on complex substrates, LcCBM65-1 not only improved the enzymatic activity of the mannanase domain, but also directed the esterase domain to the acetylated polysaccharides. LcCBM65-2 adopted a low affinity to reduce interference with the catalysis of the mannanase domain. These results demonstrate the importance of CBMs for the synergism between the two CDs of a multidomain enzyme and suggest that they contribute to the adequate degradation of complex substrates such as plant cell walls.",

        "Abstract": "Stress granules (SGs), formed by untranslated messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) during cellular stress in eukaryotes, have been linked to flavivirus interference without clear understanding. This study reveals the role of Zika virus (ZIKV) NS2B as a scaffold protein mediating interaction between protein phosphatase 1\u03b1 (PP1\u03b1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1). This interaction promotes eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation by PP1\u03b1, inhibiting SG formation. The NS2B-PP1\u03b1 complex exhibits remarkable stability, resisting ubiquitin-induced degradation and amplifying eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, thus promoting ZIKV replication. In contrast, the NS2BV35A mutant, interacting exclusively with eIF2\u03b1, fails to inhibit SG formation, resulting in reduced viral replication and diminished impact on brain organoid growth. These findings reveal PP1\u03b1's dual role in ZIKV infection, inducing interferon production as an antiviral factor and suppressing SG formation as a viral promoter. Moreover, we found that NS2B also serves as a versatile mechanism employed by flaviviruses to counter host antiviral defenses, primarily by broadly inhibiting SG formation. This research advances our comprehension of the complex interplay in flavivirus-host interactions, offering potential for innovative therapeutic strategies against flavivirus infections.",

        "Abstract": "The tripartite ParABS system mediates chromosome segregation in the majority of bacterial species. Typically, DNA-bound ParB proteins around the parS sites condense the chromosomal DNA into a higher-order multimeric nucleoprotein complex for the ParA-driven partition. Despite extensive studies, the molecular mechanism underlying the dynamic assembly of the partition complex remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that Bacillus subtilis ParB (Spo0J), through the multimerization of its N-terminal domain, forms phase-separated condensates along a single DNA molecule, leading to the concurrent organization of DNA into a compact structure. Specifically, in addition to the co-condensation of ParB dimers with DNA, the engagement of well-established ParB condensates with DNA allows for the compression of adjacent DNA and the looping of distant DNA. Notably, the presence of CTP promotes the formation of condensates by a low amount of ParB at parS sites, triggering two-step DNA condensation. Remarkably, parS-centered ParB-DNA co-condensate constitutes a robust nucleoprotein architecture capable of withstanding disruptive forces of tens of piconewton. Overall, our findings unveil diverse modes of DNA compaction enabled by phase-separated ParB and offer new insights into the dynamic assembly and maintenance of the bacterial partition complex.",

        "Title": "Association of prenatal multiple metal exposures with child neurodevelopment at 3\u00a0years of age: A prospective birth cohort study.",
        "Abstract": "Prenatal exposures to toxic metals and trace elements have been linked to childhood neurodevelopment. However, existing evidence remains inconclusive, and further research is needed to investigate the mixture effects of multiple metal exposures on childhood neurodevelopment. We aimed to examine the associations between prenatal exposure to specific metals and metal mixtures and neurodevelopment in children. In this prospective cohort study, we used the multivariable linear regressions and the robust modified Poisson regressions to explore the associations of prenatal exposure to 25 specific metals with neurodevelopment among children at 3\u00a0years of age in 854 mother-child pairs from the Jiangsu Birth Cohort (JBC) Study. The Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) was employed to assess the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. Prenatal manganese (Mn) exposure was negatively associated with the risk of non-optimal cognition development of children, while vanadium (V), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), antimony (Sb), cerium (Ce) and uranium (U) exposures were positively associated with the risk of non-optimal gross motor development. BKMR identified an interaction effect between Sb and Ce on non-optimal gross motor development. Additionally, an element risk score (ERS), representing the mixture effect of multiple metal exposures including V, Cu, Zn, Sb, Ce and U was constructed based on weights from a Poisson regression model. Children with ERS in the highest tertile had higher probability of non-optimal gross motor development (RR\u00a0=\u00a02.37, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.15, 4.86) versus those at the lowest tertile. Notably, Sb [conditional-posterior inclusion probabilities (cPIP)\u00a0=\u00a00.511] and U (cPIP\u00a0=\u00a00.386) mainly contributed to the increased risk of non-optimal gross motor development. The findings highlight the importance of paying attention to the joint effects of multiple metals on children's neurodevelopment. The ERS score may serve as an indicator of comprehensive metal exposure risk for children's neurodevelopment.",

        "Abstract": "Enhancing the flame retardancy of epoxy (EP) resins typically entailed a trade-off with other physical properties. Herein, hyperbranched poly(amidoamine) (HPAA) and phytic acid (PA) were used to functionalize graphene oxide (GO) via electrostatic self-assembly in water to prepare a phosphorus-nitrogen functionalized graphene oxide nanosheet (PN-GOs), which could be utilized as high efficient flame-retardant additive of epoxy resin without sacrificing other properties. The PN-GOs demonstrated improved dispersion and compatibility within the EP matrix, which resulted in significant concurrent enhancements in both the mechanical performance and flame-retardant properties of the PN-GOs/EP nanocomposites over virgin EP. Notably, the incorporation of just 1.0\u00a0wt% PN-GOs yielded a 20.4, 6.4 and 42.7 % increases in flexural strength, flexural modulus and impact strength for the PN-GOs/EP nanocomposites, respectively. Furthermore, simultaneous reductions were achieved in the peak heat release rate (pHRR) by 60.0 %, total smoke production (TSP) by 43.0 %, peak CO production rate (pCOP) by 57.9 %, and peak CO",

        "Abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the dysfunction and progressive death of cerebral and spinal motor neurons. Preliminary epidemiological research has hinted at a relationship between environmental risks and the escalation of ALS, but the underlying reasons remain mostly mysterious. Here we show that nanosize polystyrene plastics (PS) induce ALS-like symptoms and illustrate the related molecular mechanism. When exposed to PS, cells endure internal oxidative stress, which leads to the aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43\u2009kDa (TDP-43), triggering ALS-like characteristics. In addition, the oxidized heat shock protein 70 fails to escort TDP-43 back to the nucleus. The cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 facilitates the formation of a complex between PS and TDP-43, enhancing the condensation and solidification of TDP-43. These findings are corroborated through in silico and in vivo assays. Altogether, our work illustrates a unique toxicological mechanism induced by nanoparticles and provides insights into the connection between environmental pollution and neurodegenerative disorders.",

However, the clinical evidence supporting switching to INSTI-containing regimens in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited, as few patients have access to these regimens. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of INSTI-containing regimens in real-world settings in China compared to government-provided free ART. We compared the short-term (first 4 mo following ART initiation) and long-term (1 year after ART initiation) effectiveness between INSTI-containing regimens and free ART drugs provided by the Chinese government in 4 dimensions: viral suppression status, immune response, liver and kidney function, and AIDS-related diseases. We obtained data from electronic medical records in the National Infectious Disease Surveillance System. To control baseline confounders, we used propensity score matching (PSM), calculated using logistic regression including socio-demographic and baseline factors. Among 12,836 patients from 2012 to 2019, 673 (5.2%) used INSTI-containing regimens. Patients with INSTI-containing regimens were matched to those with free drugs (644 vs 644). For short-term effectiveness, patients initiating INSTI-containing regimens were more likely to achieve viral suppression (81.4% vs 52.0%; P\u2005<\u2005.001). The differences in immune response, liver and kidney function and AIDS-related diseases were not significant between the 2 groups. For long-term effectiveness, viral suppression rates were similar (87.96% vs 84.59%; P\u2005=\u2005.135), with no significant differences in immune response, liver and kidney function, or AIDS-related diseases. Our study suggests that patients initiating ART with INSTI-containing regimens have worse physical status at baseline than patients starting with free ART drugs. Furthermore, we found better virological performances of INSTI-containing regimens in the short-term but not in the long-term due to a high rate of drug changes. Our findings have clinical implications and provide new evidence regarding the effectiveness of INSTI-containing regimens in LMICs.",

        "Abstract": "Nucleotide second messengers are highly versatile signaling molecules that regulate a variety of key biological processes in bacteria. The best-studied examples are cyclic AMP (cAMP) and bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), which both act as global regulators. Global regulatory frameworks of c-di-GMP and cAMP in bacteria show several parallels but also significant variances. In this review, we illustrate the global regulatory models of the two nucleotide second messengers, compare the different regulatory frameworks between c-di-GMP and cAMP, and discuss the mechanisms and physiological significance of cross-regulation between c-di-GMP and cAMP. c-di-GMP responds to numerous signals dependent on a great number of metabolic enzymes, and it regulates various signal transduction pathways through its huge number of effectors with varying activities. In contrast, due to the limited quantity, the cAMP metabolic enzymes and its major effector are regulated at different levels by diverse signals. cAMP performs its global regulatory function primarily by controlling the transcription of a large number of genes via cAMP receptor protein (CRP)\u00a0in most bacteria. This review can help us understand how bacteria use the two typical nucleotide second messengers to effectively coordinate and integrate various physiological processes, providing theoretical guidelines for future research.",

        "Abstract": "Pathologic \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) spreads from cell-to-cell, in part, through binding to the lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (Lag3). Here we report that amyloid \u03b2 precursor-like protein 1 (Aplp1) interacts with Lag3 that facilitates the binding, internalization, transmission, and toxicity of pathologic \u03b1-syn. Deletion of both Aplp1 and Lag3 eliminates the loss of dopaminergic neurons and the accompanying behavioral deficits induced by \u03b1-syn preformed fibrils (PFF). Anti-Lag3 prevents the internalization of \u03b1-syn PFF by disrupting the interaction of Aplp1 and Lag3, and blocks the neurodegeneration induced by \u03b1-syn PFF in vivo. The identification of Aplp1 and the interplay with Lag3 for \u03b1-syn PFF induced pathology deepens our insight about molecular mechanisms of cell-to-cell transmission of pathologic \u03b1-syn and provides additional targets for therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease and related \u03b1-synucleinopathies.",

        "Title": "Effects of Curing Defects in Adhesive Layers on Carbon Fiber-Quartz Fiber Bonded Joint Performance.",
        "Abstract": "Due to their mechanical load-bearing and functional wave transmission, adhesively bonded joints of carbon fiber-quartz fiber composites have been widely used in the new generation of stealth aviation equipment. However, the curing defects, caused by deviations between the process environment and the setting parameters, directly affect the service performance of the joint during the curing cycle. Therefore, the thermophysical parameter evolution of adhesive films was analyzed via dynamic DSC (differential scanning calorimeter), isothermal DSC and TGA (thermal gravimetric analyzer) tests. The various prefabricating defects within the adhesive layer were used to systematically simulate the impacts of void defects on the tensile properties, and orthogonal tests were designed to clarify the effects of the curing process parameters on the joints' bonding performance. The results demonstrate that the J-116 B adhesive film starts to cure at a temperature of 160 \u00b0C and gradually forms a three-dimensional mesh-bearing structure. Furthermore, a bonding interface between the J-116 B adhesive film and the components to be connected is generated. When the curing temperature exceeds 200 \u00b0C, both the adhesive film and the resin matrix thermally degrade the molecular structure. The adhesive strength weakens with an increasing defect area ratio and number, remaining more sensitive to triangle, edge and penetration defects. By affecting the molecular structure of the adhesive film, the curing temperature has a significant impact on the bonding properties; when the curing degree is ensured, the curing pressure directly impacts the adhesive's performance by influencing the morphology, number and distribution of voids. Conversely, the heating rate and heat preservation time have minimal effects on the bonding performance.",

        "Abstract": "In this work, the dynamic marine atmospheric corrosion behavior of AZ91 Mg alloy sailing from Yellow Sea to Western Pacific Ocean was studied. The corrosion rates were measured using the weight loss method. The microstructure, phase, and chemical composition of corroded samples were investigated by SEM, EDS, XRD, and XPS. The results show that the evolution of corrosion rates of AZ91 Mg alloy was divided into three stages: rapidly increasing during the first 3 months, then remaining stable for the next three months, and finally decreasing after 6 months. The annual corrosion rate of Mg alloy reached 32.50 \u03bcm/y after exposure for 12 months in a dynamic marine atmospheric environment, which was several times higher than that of the static field exposure tests. AZ91 magnesium alloy was mainly subjected to localized corrosion with more destructiveness to Mg parts, which is mainly due to the synergistic effect of high relative humidity, the high deposition rate of chloride ion, sulfur dioxide acidic gas produced by fuel combustion, and rapid temperature changes caused by the alternating changes in longitude and latitude during navigation. As the exposure time increased, the corrosion pits gradually increased and deepened. The maximum depth of the corrosion pit was 197 \u03bcm after 12 months of exposure, which is almost 6 times the average corrosion depth. This study provides scientific data support for the application of magnesium alloys in shipborne aircraft and electronic equipment. The results could provide guidance for the design of new magnesium alloys and development of anti-corrosion technologies.",

Phenopackets is an expert knowledge-driven schema designed to facilitate the storage and exchange of multimodal patient data, and support downstream analysis. The first goal of this paper is to explore model alignment by characterizing the common data models using a newly developed data transformation process and evaluation method. Second, using OMOP normalized clinical data, we evaluate the mapping of real-world patient data to Phenopackets. We evaluate the suitability of Phenopackets as a patient data representation for real-world clinical cases.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of magnesium-doped bioactive glass (Mg-BG) on the mineralization, odontogenesis, and anti-inflammatory abilities of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs). Mg-BG powders with different Mg concentrations were successfully synthesized via the sol-gel method and evaluated using x-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Apatite formation was observed on the surfaces of the materials after soaking in simulated body fluid. hDPSCs were cultured with Mg-BG powder extracts in vitro, and no evident cytotoxicity was observed. Mg-BG induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression and mineralization of hDPSCs and upregulated the expression of odontogenic genes, including those encoding dentin sialophosphoprotein, dentin matrix protein 1, ALP, osteocalcin, and runt-related transcription factor 2. Moreover, Mg-BG substantially suppressed the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). Collectively, the results of this study suggest that Mg-BG has excellent in vitro bioactivity and is a potential material for vital pulp therapy of inflamed pulps.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding structure-property relationships in atomically precise metal nanoclusters is vital in finding selective and tunable catalysts. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) was used to benchmark seven exchange correlation functionals at different basis sets for 17 atomically precise nanoclusters against experimentally determined geometries, band gaps, and optical gaps. The set contains both monometallic and bimetallic clusters that possess at least two types of 3d transition metals (specifically, Cu, Ni, Fe, or Co). The benchmark highlights that PBE0 is a good functional to use regardless of the basis set, and Minnesota functionals do well with respect to specific metals. Further, while long-range corrected functionals overestimate band and optical gaps, they model absorption features better than the other considered functionals. The study additionally looks at the photoinduced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the CO",

        "Title": "SAMP: Identifying Antimicrobial Peptides by an Ensemble Learning Model Based on Proportionalized Split Amino Acid Composition.",
        "Abstract": "It is projected that 10 million deaths could be attributed to drug-resistant bacteria infections in 2050. To address this concern, identifying new-generation antibiotics is an effective way. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a class of innate immune effectors, have received significant attention for their capacity to eliminate drug-resistant pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Recent years have witnessed widespread applications of computational methods especially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) for discovering AMPs. However, existing methods only use features including compositional, physiochemical, and structural properties of peptides, which cannot fully capture sequence information from AMPs. Here, we present SAMP, an ensemble random projection (RP) based computational model that leverages a new type of features called Proportionalized Split Amino Acid Composition (PSAAC) in addition to conventional sequence-based features for AMP prediction. With this new feature set, SAMP captures the residue patterns like sorting signals at around both the N-terminus and the C-terminus, while also retaining the sequence order information from the middle peptide fragments. Benchmarking tests on different balanced and imbalanced datasets demonstrate that SAMP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, such as iAMPpred and AMPScanner V2, in terms of accuracy, MCC, G-measure and F1-score. In addition, by leveraging an ensemble RP architecture, SAMP is scalable to processing large-scale AMP identification with further performance improvement, compared to those models without RP. To facilitate the use of SAMP, we have developed a Python package freely available at https://github.com/wan-mlab/SAMP.",

        "Title": "GestaltMML: Enhancing Rare Genetic Disease Diagnosis through Multimodal Machine Learning Combining Facial Images and Clinical Texts.",
        "Abstract": "Individuals with suspected rare genetic disorders often undergo multiple clinical evaluations, imaging studies, laboratory tests and genetic tests, to find a possible answer over a prolonged period of time. Addressing this \"diagnostic odyssey\" thus has substantial clinical, psychosocial, and economic benefits. Many rare genetic diseases have distinctive facial features, which can be used by artificial intelligence algorithms to facilitate clinical diagnosis, in prioritizing candidate diseases to be further examined by lab tests or genetic assays, or in helping the phenotype-driven reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data. Existing methods using frontal facial photos were built on conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), rely exclusively on facial images, and cannot capture non-facial phenotypic traits and demographic information essential for guiding accurate diagnoses. Here we introduce GestaltMML, a multimodal machine learning (MML) approach solely based on the Transformer architecture. It integrates facial images, demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity), and clinical notes (optionally, a list of Human Phenotype Ontology terms) to improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we also evaluated GestaltMML on a diverse range of datasets, including 528 diseases from the GestaltMatcher Database, several in-house datasets of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS, over-growth syndrome with distinct facial features), Sotos syndrome (overgrowth syndrome with overlapping features with BWS), NAA10-related neurodevelopmental syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome), and KBG syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome). Our results suggest that GestaltMML effectively incorporates multiple modalities of data, greatly narrowing candidate genetic diagnoses of rare diseases and may facilitate the reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data.",

        "Abstract": "Cardiac arrest (CA) remains a leading cause of death, with suboptimal survival rates despite efforts involving cardiopulmonary resuscitation and advanced life-support technology. Post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction (PRMD) is an important determinant of patient outcomes. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury underlies this dysfunction. Previous reports have shown that ruthenium red (RR) has a protective effect against cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury; however, its precise mechanism of action in PRMD remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of RR on PRMD and analyzed its underlying mechanisms. Ventricular fibrillation was induced in rats, which were then subjected to cardiopulmonary resuscitation to establish an experimental CA model. At the onset of return of spontaneous circulation, RR (2.5\u00a0mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally. Our study showed that RR improved myocardial function and reduced the production of oxidative stress markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSSG), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. RR also helped maintain mitochondrial structure and increased ATP and GTP levels. Additionally, RR effectively attenuated myocardial apoptosis. Furthermore, we observed downregulation of proteins closely related to mitophagy, including ubiquitin-specific protease 33 (USP33) and P62, whereas LC3B (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B) was upregulated. The upregulation of mitophagy may play a critical role in reducing myocardial injury. These results demonstrate that RR may attenuate PRMD by promoting mitophagy through the inhibition of USP33. These effects are likely mediated through diverse mechanisms, including antioxidant activity, apoptosis suppression, and preservation of mitochondrial integrity and energy metabolism. Consequently, RR has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for addressing post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "Ionising radiation exposure can lead to acute haematopoietic radiation syndrome. Despite significant advancements in the field of radioprotection, no drugs with high efficacy and low toxicity have yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. FG-4592, as a proline hydroxylase inhibitor, may play an important role in radioprotection of the haematopoietic system. Mice were peritoneal injected with FG-4592 or normal saline. After irradiation, the survival time, body weight, peripheral blood cell and bone marrow cell (BMC) count, cell apoptosis, pathology were analysed and RNA-sequence technique (RNA-Seq) was conducted to explore the mechanism of FG-4592 in the haematopoietic system. Our results indicated that FG-4592 improved the survival rate and weight of irradiated mice and protected the spleen, thymus and bone marrow from IR-induced injury. The number of BMCs was increased and protected against IR-induced apoptosis. FG-4592 also promoted the recovery of the blood system and erythroid differentiation. The results of RNA-Seq and Western blot showed that the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signalling pathway were upregulated by FG-4592. Meanwhile, RT-PCR results showed that FG-4592 could promote inflammatory response significantly. FG-4592 exhibited radioprotective effects in the haematopoietic system by promoting inflammatory response and targeting the NF-\u03baB, HIF signalling pathway.",

This retrospective study investigated 51 cases of extended suicide involving mental disorders in central China with aim of better understanding risk factors for such events and guiding prevention strategies. Over an 8-year period from 2015 to 2022, cases were collected from forensic institutions, and demographic characteristics, case details, and psychiatric data were recorded. The 51 incidents involved 51 perpetrators and 79 victims, with more female perpetrators (58.8%) and more female victims (54.4%). The average age of the perpetrators was 36.1, and most were married (88.2%). Almost all of the victims were family members of the perpetrator, like the most numerous children (64.6%), followed by spouses (24.1%). The most common homicide mode of death was mechanical asphyxia (38.0%), followed by sharp devices (36.7%) and drug poisoning (16.5%). Depressive disorders (76.5%) were the most common diagnosis of mental disorder for perpetrators. The study analyzed the unique characteristics of extended suicide to enrich such data. These findings help strengthen the screening and identification of potential perpetrators and victims to prevent such cases from occurring.",

        "Abstract": "Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating wheat disease. Fhb1, the most widely applied genetic locus for FHB resistance, is conferred by TaHRC of an unknown mode of action. Here, we show that TaHRC alleles distinctly drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) within a proteinaceous complex, determining FHB susceptibility or resistance. TaHRC-S (susceptible) exhibits stronger LLPS ability than TaHRC-R (resistant), and this distinction is further intensified by fungal mycotoxin deoxynivalenol, leading to opposing FHB symptoms. TaHRC recruits a protein class with intrinsic LLPS potentials, referred to as an \"HRC-containing hub.\" TaHRC-S drives condensation of hub components, while TaHRC-R comparatively suppresses hub condensate formation. The function of TaSR45a splicing factor, a hub member, depends on TaHRC-driven condensate state, which in turn differentially directs alternative splicing, switching between susceptibility and resistance to wheat FHB. These findings reveal a mechanism for FHB spread within a spike and shed light on the roles of complex condensates in controlling plant disease.",

        "Title": "Multi-Dimensional Medical Image Fusion With Complex Sparse Representation.",
        "Abstract": "In the field of medical imaging, the fusion of data from diverse modalities plays a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of pathological conditions. Sparse representation (SR), a robust signal modeling technique, has demonstrated noteworthy success in multi-dimensional (MD) medical image fusion. However, a fundamental limitation appearing in existing SR models is their lack of directionality, restricting their efficacy in extracting anatomical details from different imaging modalities. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel directional SR model, termed complex sparse representation (ComSR), specifically designed for medical image fusion. ComSR independently represents MD signals over directional dictionaries along specific directions, allowing precise analysis of intricate details of MD signals. Besides, current studies in medical image fusion mostly concentrate on addressing either 2D or 3D fusion problems. This work bridges this gap by proposing a MD medical image fusion method based on ComSR, presenting a unified framework for both 2D and 3D fusion tasks. Experimental results across six multi-modal medical image fusion tasks, involving 93 pairs of 2D source images and 20 pairs of 3D source images, substantiate the superiority of our proposed method over 11 state-of-the-art 2D fusion methods and 4 representative 3D fusion methods, in terms of both visual quality and objective evaluation. The source code of our fusion method is available at https://github.com/Imagefusions/imagefusions/tree/main.",

        "Abstract": "Although calcium phosphate has been extensively utilized in orthopedic applications such as spine, limbs, dentistry, and maxillofacial surgery, the lack of osteoinductive properties often hinders its effectiveness in treating bone defects resulting from pathological micro-environment such as tumor surgery, osteoporosis, osteomyelitis, and diabetic. Therefore, a novel bone cement based on magnesium-doped bioactive glass was developed in this study. The moderate release of magnesium ions improved the mechanical properties by controlling the crystal size of hydroxyapatite. Through detailed discussion of element content and heat treatment temperature, it was found that 2Mg-BG-800 was suitable for the construction of bone cement. 2Mg-BG-BC exhibited favorable initial (15\u00a0min) and final (30\u00a0min) setting time, compressive strength (29.45\u00a0MPa), compressive modulus (1851.49\u00a0MPa), injectability, and shape-adaptability. Furthermore, Mg-BG-BC demonstrated the ability to enhance the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, and induce macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype, suggesting its potential for osteoporotic fracture regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive lymphoma that primarily affects the central nervous system. Current treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and whole-brain radiotherapy, often fail to achieve satisfactory results. The prognosis for patients with refractory or relapsed (R/R) PCNSL is bleak. The optimal treatment for refractory or relapsed PCNSL is poorly defined due to a limited number of studies in this setting. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, as part of targeted therapy regimens, have undergone testing in several clinical trials against PCNSL and have shown promising results in the treatment of R/R PCNSL. In this meta-analysis, we aim to explore and critically appraise the evidence regarding the efficacy of BTK inhibitors in the treatment of refractory or relapsed PCNSL.",

        "Abstract": "The cell nucleus serves as the pivotal command center of living cells, and delivering therapeutic agents directly into the nucleus can result in highly efficient anti-tumor eradication of cancer cells. However, nucleus-targeting drug delivery is very difficult due to the presence of numerous biological barriers. Here, three antitumor drugs (DNase I, ICG: indocyanine green, and THP: pirarubicin) were sequentially triggered protein self-assembly to produce a nucleus-targeting and programmed responsive multi-drugs delivery system (DIT). DIT consisted of uniform spherical particles with a size of 282\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.7\u00a0nm. The acidic microenvironment of tumors and near-infrared light could successively trigger DIT for the programmed release of three drugs, enabling targeted delivery to the tumor. THP served as a nucleus-guiding molecule and a chemotherapy drug. Through THP-guided DIT, DNase I was successfully delivered to the nucleus of tumor cells and killed them by degrading their DNA. Tumor acidic microenvironment had the ability to induce DIT, leading to the aggregation of sufficient ICG in the tumor tissues. This provided an opportunity for the photothermal therapy of ICG. Hence, three drugs were cleverly combined using a simple method to achieve multi-drugs targeted delivery and highly effective combined anticancer therapy.",

Currently, the selection of key frames relies on the doctor's visual judgement which is time-consuming and laborious. This study proposes a key frame recognition algorithm based on deep learning. Firstly, wavelet denoising and multi-scale vessel-enhanced filtering are used to preserve the morphological features of the adrenal veins. Furthermore, by incorporating the self-attention mechanism, an improved recognition model called ResNet50-SA is obtained. Compared with commonly used transfer learning, the new model achieves 97.11% in accuracy, precision, recall, ",

        "Title": "MSC-derived small extracellular vesicles mitigate diabetic retinopathy by stabilizing Nrf2 through miR-143-3p-mediated inhibition of neddylation.",
        "Abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a highly hazardous and widespread complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). The accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a central role in DR development. The aim of this research was to examine the impact and mechanisms of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEV) on regulating ROS and retinal damage in DR. Intravitreal injection of sEV inhibited Cullin3 neddylation, stabilized Nrf2, decreased ROS, reduced retinal inflammation, suppressed M\u00fcller gliosis, and mitigated DR. Based on MSC-sEV miRNA sequencing, bioinformatics software, and dual-luciferase reporter assay, miR-143-3p was identified to be the key effector for MSC-sEV's role in regulating neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated 8 (NEDD8)-mediated neddylation. sEV were able to be internalized by M\u00fcller cells. Compared to advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)-induced M\u00fcller cells, sEV coculture decreased Cullin3 neddylation, activated Nrf2 signal pathway to combat ROS-induced inflammation. The barrier function of endothelial cells was impaired when endothelial cells were treated with the supernatant of AGEs-induced M\u00fcller cells, but was restored when treated with supernatant of AGEs-induced M\u00fcller cells cocultured with sEV. The protective effect of sEV was, however, compromised when miR-143-3p was inhibited in sEV. Moreover, the protective efficacy of sEV was diminished when NEDD8 was overexpressed in M\u00fcller cells. These findings showed MSC-sEV delivered miR-143-3p to inhibit Cullin3 neddylation, stabilizing Nrf2 to counteract ROS-induced inflammation and reducing vascular leakage. Our findings suggest that MSC-sEV may be a potential nanotherapeutic agent for DR, and that Cullin3 neddylation could be a new target for DR therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Research has found that autistic children can navigate multilingual schools and communities without harming their language skills or school success. However, they may encounter specific challenges within the United States, where educational and healthcare systems are insufficiently equipped to meet their needs. This review examined 46 US-based studies on the topic and findings reveal persistent deficit-based ideas about multilingualism and autism (e.g., professionals recommending that autistic students only speak and learn in English) accompanied by patterns of unequal identification of autism among multilingual children. These findings highlight issues of disproportionality and inadequate access to educational and healthcare resources. However, recent studies indicate that incorporating a child's native language in education not only enhances learning and behavioral outcomes but also boosts cognitive functions like problem-solving and planning. Taken as a whole, current research suggests that intentionally addressing linguistic diversity will allow educational and medical systems to better serve autistic children.",

        "Abstract": "For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis, the rupture of thin lymphatic vessel walls leads to a profuse outflow of lymph fluid. Typically, chyloperitoneum tends to precede the development of chylothorax in patients with cancer. The present study describes the case of a male patient with hepatocellular carcinoma who developed chylothorax without chyloperitoneum. Computed tomography showed lymphatic system developmental abnormalities with a large volume of leaked lymph fluid. Multiple thoracic duct ligations (TDLs) failed, but a side-to-end lymphatic venous anastomosis (LVA) surgery resolved the symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of chylothorax occurrence after cirrhosis further complicated by congenital lymphatic abnormalities in the English-language literature. In conclusion, LVA could be appropriate to treat chylothorax when TDL is ineffective as a remedial or even prophylactic intervention.",

        "Abstract": "TDP-43 is implicated in the dynamic formation of nuclear bodies and stress granules through phase separation. In diseased states, it can further condense into pathological aggregates in the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to the onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this study, we evaluate the effect of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with different functional groups on TDP-43's phase separation and aggregation in various cellular locations. We find that halogen atom-doped GQDs (GQDs-Cl, Cl-GQDs-OH) penetrate the nuclear envelope, inhibiting the assembly of TDP-43 nuclear bodies and stress granules under oxidative stress or hyperosmotic environments, and reduce amyloid aggregates and disease-associated phosphorylation of TDP-43. Mechanistic analysis reveals GQDs-Cl and Cl-GQDs-OH modulate TDP-43 phase separation through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Our findings highlight the potential of GQDs-Cl and Cl-GQDs-OH in modulating nuclear protein condensation and pathological aggregation, offering direction for the innovative design of GQDs to modulate protein phase separation and aggregation.",

        "Abstract": "Iodine is involved in the synthesis of thyroid hormones and plays a crucial role in human life. Both iodine deficiency and excess are common issues in certain populations. Iodine also has extrathyroidal effects on organs that can uptake it independently of thyroid hormones. Recently, multiple clinical studies have shown a connection between iodine intake and metabolic disorders, such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. However, the results of these studies have been inconsistent, and the mechanisms behind these associations are still not well understood. Therefore, in this review, we aim to examine the recent research progress regarding the relationship between iodine and metabolic disorders, along with the relevant mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Phenotype-driven gene prioritization is a critical process in the diagnosis of rare genetic disorders for identifying and ranking potential disease-causing genes based on observed physical traits or phenotypes. While traditional approaches rely on curated knowledge graphs with phenotype-gene relations, recent advancements in large language models have opened doors to the potential of AI predictions through extensive training on diverse corpora and complex models. This study conducted a comprehensive evaluation of five large language models, including two Generative Pre-trained Transformers series, and three Llama2 series, assessing their performance across three key metrics: task completeness, gene prediction accuracy, and adherence to required output structures. Various experiments explored combinations of models, prompts, input types, and task difficulty levels. Our findings reveal that even the best-performing LLM, GPT-4, achieved an accuracy of 16.0%, which still lags behind traditional bioinformatics tools. Prediction accuracy increased with the parameter/model size. A similar increasing trend was observed for the task completion rate, with complicated prompts more likely to increase task completeness in models smaller than GPT-4. However, complicated prompts are more likely to decrease the structure compliance rate, but no prompt effects on GPT-4. Compared to HPO term-based input, LLM was also able to achieve better than random prediction accuracy by taking free-text input, but slightly lower than with the HPO input. Bias analysis showed that certain genes, such as MECP2, CDKL5, and SCN1A, are more likely to be top-ranked, potentially explaining the variances observed across different datasets. This study provides valuable insights into the integration of LLMs within genomic analysis, contributing to the ongoing discussion on the utilization of advanced LLMs in clinical workflows.",

        "Abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein forms amyloid fibrils that are critical in the progression of Parkinson's disease and serves as the pathological hallmark of this condition. Different posttranslational modifications have been identified at multiple sites of \u03b1-synuclein, influencing its conformation, aggregation and function. Here, we investigate how disease-related phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation at the same \u03b1-synuclein site (S87) affect fibril structure and neuropathology. Using semi-synthesis, we obtained homogenous \u03b1-synuclein monomer with site-specific phosphorylation (pS87) and O-GlcNAcylation (gS87) at S87, respectively. Cryo-EM revealed that pS87 and gS87 \u03b1-synuclein form two distinct fibril structures. The GlcNAc situated at S87 establishes interactions with K80 and E61, inducing a unique iron-like fold with the GlcNAc molecule on the iron handle. Phosphorylation at the same site prevents a lengthy C-terminal region including residues 73 to 140 from incorporating into the fibril core due to electrostatic repulsion. Instead, the N-terminal half of the fibril (1-72) takes on an arch-like fibril structure. We further show that both pS87 and gS87 \u03b1-synuclein fibrils display reduced neurotoxicity and propagation activity compared with unmodified \u03b1-synuclein fibrils. Our findings demonstrate that different posttranslational modifications at the same site can produce distinct fibril structures, which emphasizes link between posttranslational modifications and amyloid fibril formation and pathology.",

        "Abstract": "Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease raising the risks of tooth-supporting structures destruction and even tooth loss. The way to reconstruct periodontal bone tissues in inflammatory microenvironment has been long in demand for periodontitis treatment. In this study, the lycium barbarum glycopeptide (LbGP) loaded gelatin-based scaffolds were fabricated for periodontitis treatment. Gelatin microspheres with suitable size were prepared by emulsification and gathered by oxidized sodium alginate to prepare heterogeneous bilayer gelatin-based scaffolds, and then they were loaded with LbGP. The prepared scaffolds possessed interconnected porous microstructures, good degradation properties, sufficient mechanical properties, sustained release behavior and well biocompatibility. ",

        "Title": "Research progress of robot and laparoscope in postoperative complications of rectal cancer.",
        "Abstract": "Rectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumours worldwide, and it is also one of the major diseases that seriously threatens human life and health. At present, the main treatment for rectal cancer is still surgical treatment. The surgical methods have been rapidly developed from the previous open surgery to the current minimally invasive surgery. At present, there are two main minimally invasive surgeries: robotic surgery and laparoscopic surgery. Due to the particularity of rectal cancer surgery, more and more studies have shown that robotic rectal cancer surgery has more advantages than laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery. However, whether the incidence of postoperative complications after robotic rectal cancer surgery is lower than that after laparoscopy is not uniformly conclusive in the current study. Therefore, in this paper, we searched Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase and other databases, collected the latest published meta-analysis on postoperative complications of robots and laparoscopy in rectal cancer, and assessed the quality of the included meta-analysis by AMSTAR-2 evaluation tool, so as to explore the current research status and research quality of postoperative complications of robots and laparoscopy in rectal cancer. The results showed that compared with laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery, robotic rectal cancer surgery could improve the postoperative urinary and reproductive function of male patients, but it could not be proved that robotic rectal cancer surgery could reduce the incidence of postoperative complications, anastomotic leakage, urinary retention, intestinal obstruction, anastomotic bleeding, incision infection, pulmonary infection, venous thrombosis and abdominal abscess; however, the overall quality of meta-analysis of the results of each complication was low or very low. Therefore, multicenter, large-sample, high-quality prospective randomised controlled studies and high-quality meta-analysis are still needed to prove the advantages of robotic rectal cancer surgery in postoperative complications in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Environmental hypoxia adversely affects reproductive health in humans and animals at high altitudes. Therefore, how to alleviate the follicle development disorder caused by hypoxia exposure and to improve the competence of fertility in plateau non-habituated female animals are important problems to be solved urgently. In this study, a hypobaric hypoxic chamber was used for 4 weeks to simulate hypoxic conditions in female mice, and the effects of hypoxia on follicle development, proliferation and apoptosis of granulosa cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in MII oocyte and 2-cell rate were evaluated. At the same time, the alleviating effect of melatonin on hypoxic exposure-induced oogenesis damage was evaluated by feeding appropriate amounts of melatonin daily under hypoxia for 4 weeks. The results showed that hypoxia exposure significantly increased the proportion of antral follicles in the ovary, the number of proliferation and apoptosis granulosa cells in the follicle, and the level of ROS in MII oocytes, eventually led to the decline of oocyte quality. However, these defects were alleviated when melatonin was fed under hypoxia conditions. Together, these findings suggest that hypoxia exposure impaired follicular development and reduced oocyte quality, and that melatonin supplementation alleviated the fertility reduction induced by hypoxia exposure.",

        "Abstract": "Fermented foods have shown promise in preventing or treating ulcerative colitis (UC) via regulating intestinal flora and correcting metabolic disorders. However, the prevention effect of fermented Wallace melon juice (FMJ) on UC is unclear. In this study, the effects of FMJ on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC were investigated via 16S rRNA sequencing and non-targeted metabolomics. The results showed that FMJ was effective in alleviating the symptoms of UC, reducing histological damage and oxidative stress, decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. After FMJ treatment, the level of propionic acid, butyric acid, and valeric acid increased by 14.1%, 44.4%, and 52.4% compared to DSS-induced UC mice. Meanwhile, the levels of harmful bacteria such as Oscillospira, Bacteroidetes, and Erysipelotrichaceae and Clostridium decreased, while the levels of beneficial bacteria such as Akkermansia, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium increased. Fecal metabolomics analysis identified 31 differential metabolites, which could regulate metabolic disorders in UC mice by controlling the primary bile acid biosynthesis, purine metabolism, and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis pathway. Additionally, the abundances of butyric acid, bile acids, and pantothenic acid were positively correlated with Allobaculum, Bifidobacterium, and other beneficial bacteria (R",

        "Abstract": "G-protein coupled receptor 15 (GPR15) is expressed on T-cells. We previously reported knockout of GPR15 increased acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in mice. In this study, we identified thrombin receptor activating peptide-6 (TRAP-6, peptide sequence: SFLLRN) as an activator of GPR15. GRP15 and \u03b2-arrestin2 were needed for TRAP-6-mediated inhibition of mixed lymphocyte reactions. TRAP-6 decreased acute GvHD in allotransplant models in mice, an effect dependent on GPR15-expression in donor T-cells. RNA-seq and protein analyses indicated TRAP-6 increased binding of \u03b2-arrestin2/TAB1 and inhibited phosphorylation of TAK1 and NF-\u03baB-P65. GPR15 is expressed differently on CD4",

        "Abstract": "The burgeoning comprehension of protein phase separation (PS) has ushered in a wealth of bioinformatics tools for the prediction of phase-separating proteins (PSPs). These tools often skew towards PSPs with a high content of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), thus frequently undervaluing potential PSPs without IDRs. Nonetheless, PS is not only steered by IDRs but also by the structured modular domains and interactions that aren't necessarily reflected in amino acid sequences. In this work, we introduce PSPire, a machine learning predictor that incorporates both residue-level and structure-level features for the precise prediction of PSPs. Compared to current PSP predictors, PSPire shows a notable improvement in identifying PSPs without IDRs, which underscores the crucial role of non-IDR, structure-based characteristics in multivalent interactions throughout the PS process. Additionally, our biological validation experiments substantiate the predictive capacity of PSPire, with 9 out of 11 chosen candidate PSPs confirmed to form condensates within cells.",

        "Abstract": "Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) secretes effector proteins that enter plant cells to manipulate host immune processes. In this report, we present an important Pst effector, Pst03724, whose mRNA expression level increases during Pst infection of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Silencing of Pst03724 reduced the growth and development of Pst. Pst03724 targeted the wheat calmodulin TaCaM3-2B, a positive regulator of wheat immunity. Subsequent investigations revealed that Pst03724 interferes with the TaCaM3-2B-NAD kinase (NADK) TaNADK2 association and thus inhibits the enzyme activity of TaNADK2 activated by TaCaM3-2B. Knocking down TaNADK2 expression by virus-mediated gene silencing significantly increased fungal growth and development, suggesting a decrease in resistance against Pst infection. In conclusion, our findings indicate that Pst effector Pst03724 inhibits the activity of NADK by interfering with the TaCaM3-2B-TaNADK2 association, thereby facilitating Pst infection.",

        "Abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by an unpredictable course of flares and remission with diverse manifestations. Lupus nephritis, one of the major disease manifestations of SLE for organ damage and mortality, is a key component of lupus classification criteria. Accurately identifying lupus nephritis in electronic health records (EHRs) would therefore benefit large cohort observational studies and clinical trials where characterization of the patient population is critical for recruitment, study design, and analysis. Lupus nephritis can be recognized through procedure codes and structured data, such as laboratory tests. However, other critical information documenting lupus nephritis, such as histologic reports from kidney biopsies and prior medical history narratives, require sophisticated text processing to mine information from pathology reports and clinical notes. In this study, we developed algorithms to identify lupus nephritis with and without natural language processing (NLP) using EHR data from the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW).",

        "Title": "Down-regulation of MKP-1 in hippocampus protects against stress-induced depression-like behaviors and neuroinflammation.",
        "Abstract": "Chronic stress is the primary environmental risk factor for major depressive disorder (MDD), and there is compelling evidence that neuroinflammation is the major pathomechanism linking chronic stress to MDD. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) is a negative regulator of MAPK signaling pathways involved in cellular stress responses, survival, and neuroinflammation. We examined the possible contributions of MKP-1 to stress-induced MDD by comparing depression-like behaviors (anhedonia, motor retardation, behavioral despair), neuroinflammatory marker expression, and MAPK signaling pathways among rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), overexpressing MKP-1 in the hippocampus, and CUMS-exposed rats underexpressing MKP-1 in the hippocampus. Rats exposed to CUMS exhibited MKP-1 overexpression, greater numbers of activated microglia, and enhanced expressions of neuroinflammatory markers (interleukin [IL]-6, [IL]-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u0251, and decreased phosphorylation levels of ERK and p38 in the hippocampus as well as anhedonia in the sucrose preference test, motor retardation in the open field, and greater immobility (despair) in the forced swimming tests. These signs of neuroinflammation and depression-like behaviors and phosphorylation levels of ERK and p38 were also observed in rats overexpressing MKP-1 without CUMS exposure, while CUMS-induced neuroinflammation, microglial activation, phosphorylation levels of ERK and p38, and depression-like behaviors were significantly reversed by MKP-1 knockdown. Moreover, MKP-1 knockdown promoted the activation of the MAPK isoform ERK, implying that the antidepressant-like effects of MKP-1 knockdown may be mediated by the ERK pathway disinhibition. These findings suggested that hippocampal MKP-1 is an essential regulator of stress-induced neuroinflammation and a promising target for antidepressant development.",

        "Abstract": "The titanium-stabilized austenitic stainless steel Fe-15Cr-15Ni, which shows enhanced resistance to irradiation swelling compared with more traditional 316Ti, has been selected as a core material for fast reactors. Data on the evolution of irradiation swelling in 15-15Ti steels at very high doses, which cannot be easily achieved by neutron irradiation, are still lacking. In this paper, the swelling behavior of the titanium-modified austenitic stainless steel 15-15Ti was investigated by pre-implantation of He at room temperature followed by Ni-ion irradiation at 580 \u00b0C to peak doses of 120, 240 and 400 dpa. Relatively small cavities were observed in the zone of helium implantation, while large cavities appeared in the region near the damage peak. A correction formula for the dpa curve was proposed and applied to samples with large swelling. It was found that the steady-state swelling rate of 15-15Ti remains at ~1%/dpa even at high doses. By comparing the swelling data of the helium-implanted and helium-free regions at same doses, 70 dpa and 122 dpa, the suppression of swelling by excessive helium can be deduced at such doses.",

        "Title": "Do accent and input modality modulate processing of language switches in bilingual language comprehension?",
        "Abstract": "We examined how bilinguals process language switches between their first (L1) and second language (L2). Language switching costs (slower responses to language switch than nonswitch trials) appear to arise more systematically in production than in comprehension, possibly because the latter context might sometimes elicit less language coactivation (Declerck et al., 2019). This might reduce language competition and in turn the need for bilinguals to apply language control when processing language switches. Yet even in comprehension, language coactivation may vary depending on variables such as the accent of the speaker (e.g., whether the L2 words are pronounced with an L1 or L2 accent) and input modality (spoken or written). In three experiments conducted during 2021-2022, we tested how unbalanced Mandarin-English bilinguals processed language switches during comprehension and the potential influence of a speaker's accent and input modality. Overall, across settings, participants experienced significant language switching costs. In some conditions, switching costs were larger to L1-Mandarin than to L2-English, an asymmetry consistent with the participants' dominance in L1-Mandarin and the application of language control. However, manipulating accent and input modality did not influence language switches, suggesting they did not impact language coactivation sufficiently to modulate language control.

        "Abstract": "Spread Through Air Spaces (STAS) is involved in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) recurrence, where cancer cells spread into adjacent lung tissue, impacting surgical planning and prognosis assessment. Radiomics-based models show promise in predicting STAS preoperatively, enhancing surgical precision and prognostic evaluations. The present study performed network meta-analysis to assess the predictive efficacy of imaging models for STAS in LUAD. Data were systematically sourced from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Wiley and Web of Science, according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions) and A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2. Using Stata software v17.0 for meta-analysis, surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) was applied to identify the most effective diagnostic method. Quality assessments were performed using Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias tool and publication bias was assessed using Deeks' funnel plot. The analysis encompassed 14 articles, involving 3,734 patients, and assessed 17 predictive models for STAS in LUAD. According to comprehensive analysis of SUCRA, the machine learning (ML)_Peri_tumour model had the highest accuracy (56.5), the Features_computed tomography (CT) model had the highest sensitivity (51.9) and the positron emission tomography (pet)_CT model had the highest specificity (53.9). ML_Peri_tumour model had the highest predictive performance. The accuracy was as follows: ML_Peri_tumour vs. Features_CT [relative risk (RR)=1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99-1.32]; ML_Peri_tumour vs. ML_Tumour (RR=1.04; 95% CI, 0.83-1.30) and ML_Peri_tumour vs. pet_CT (RR=1.04; 95% CI, 0.84-1.29). Comparative analyses revealed heightened predictive accuracy of the ML_Peri_tumour compared with other models. Nonetheless, the field of radiological feature analysis for STAS prediction remains nascent, necessitating improvements in technical reproducibility and comprehensive model evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "High-quality conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films with orientation and controlled structure are extremely desired for applications. Here, we report the effective construction of CMP 3D composite films (pZn/PTPCz) with a controlled porosity structure and preferred orientation using the template-assisted electropolymerization (EP) approach for the first time. The structure of pZn/PTPCz composite thin films and nitrophenol sensing performance were thoroughly studied. When compared to the control CMP film made on flat indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, the as-prepared pZn/PTPCz composite films showed significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity and much better sensing performance for the model explosive. This was attributed to the metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) of porous nanostructured zinc (pZn) and the additional macroporosity of the pZn/PTPCz composite films. This work provides a feasible approach for creating oriented 3D CMP-based thin films for advanced applications.",

Necroptosis is a type of cell death that regulates intestinal homeostasis and inflammation. The mechanism(s) underlying the protective role of macrophage Tim-3 in intestinal inflammation is unclear; thus, we investigated whether specific Tim-3 knockdown in macrophages drives intestinal inflammation via necroptosis. Tim-3 protein and mRNA expression were assessed via double immunofluorescence staining and single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA seq), respectively, in the colonic tissues of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls.

However, the presence of esophageal retention obscured observation, making it difficult to detect EC early, which leads to misdiagnosis and poor prognosis in AC patients with EC. Besides, the persistence of high-risk factors may have contributed to the rapid progression of EC shortly after per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). Therefore, it is imperative to alert clinicians to this extremely rare and instructive early-onset cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Collapse is a major engineering hazard in open-cut foundation pit construction, and risk assessment is crucial for considerably reducing engineering hazards. This study aims to address the ambiguity problem of qualitative index quantification and the failure of high-conflict evidence fusion in risk assessment. Thus, a fast-converging and high-reliability multi-source data fusion method based on the cloud model (CM) and improved Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is proposed. The method can achieve an accurate assessment of subway pit collapse risks. First, the CM is introduced to quantify the qualitative metrics. Then, a new correction parameter is defined for improving the conflicts among evidence bodies based on conflict degree, discrepancy degree and uncertainty, while a fine-tuning term is added to reduce the subjective effect of global focal element assignment. Finally, the risk assessment result is obtained according to the maximum affiliation principle. The method is successfully applied to Luochongwei Station, where the difference between the maximum value and the second largest value of the basic probability assignment is 0.624, and the global uncertainty degree is 0.087. Both values satisfy the decision evaluation condition; however, values of other methods only satisfy one or neither condition. In addition, the proposed method requires only four cycles to reach the steady state by fusing data of the same index, which has faster convergence compared with that of other methods. The proposed method has good universality and effectiveness in subway pit collapse risk assessment.",

        "Abstract": "Phase separation is a vital mechanism that mediates the formation of biomolecular condensates and their functions. Necroptosis is a lytic form of programmed cell death mediated by RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL downstream of TNFR1 and has been implicated in mediating many human diseases. However, whether necroptosis is regulated by phase separation is not yet known. Here, we show that upon the induction of necroptosis and recruitment by the adaptor protein TAX1BP1, PARP5A and its binding partner RNF146 form liquid-like condensates by multivalent interactions to perform poly ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) and PARylation-dependent ubiquitination (PARdU) of activated RIPK1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We show that PARdU predominantly occurs on the K376 residue of mouse RIPK1, which promotes proteasomal degradation of kinase-activated RIPK1 to restrain necroptosis. Our data demonstrate that PARdU on K376 of mouse RIPK1 provides an alternative cell death checkpoint mediated by phase separation-dependent control of necroptosis by PARP5A and RNF146.",

        "Abstract": "To enhance phenotype recognition in clinical notes of genetic diseases, we developed two models-PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT-for expanding the vocabularies of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. While HPO offers a standardized vocabulary for phenotypes, existing tools often fail to capture the full scope of phenotypes due to limitations from traditional heuristic or rule-based approaches. Our models leverage large language models to automate the detection of phenotype terms, including those not in the current HPO. We compare these models with PhenoTagger, another HPO recognition tool, and found that our models identify a wider range of phenotype concepts, including previously uncharacterized ones. Our models also show strong performance in case studies on biomedical literature. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of BERT- and GPT-based models in aspects such as architecture and accuracy. Overall, our models enhance automated phenotype detection from clinical texts, improving downstream analyses on human diseases.",

        "Abstract": "In this work, full-color and stable white organic afterglow materials with outstanding water, organic solvents, and temperature resistances have been developed for the first time by embedding the selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into melamine-formaldehyde polymer via solution polymerization. The afterglow quantum yields and lifetimes of the resulting polymer films were up to 22.7\u2009% and 4.83\u2005s, respectively, under ambient conditions. For the coronene-doped sample, its afterglow color could be linearly tuned between yellow and blue by adjusting the temperature, and it could still emit an intense blue afterglow with a lifetime of 0.68\u2005s at 440\u2005K. Moreover, the films showed a bright and stable white afterglow at 370\u2005K with a lifetime of 2.80\u2005s and maintained an excellent afterglow performance after soaking in water and organic solvents for more than 150\u2005days. In addition, the application potential of the polymer films in information encryption and anti-counterfeiting was also demonstrated.",

        "Title": "Longitudinal associations between loneliness and online game addiction among undergraduates: A moderated mediation model.",
        "Abstract": "Online gaming addiction (OGA) has become a noteworthy public concern, especially among university students, thereby requiring in-depth scrutiny. Although previous cross-sectional studies have established a positive link between loneliness and OGA, there is a lack of longitudinal evidence within this field. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms that elucidate the connection between loneliness and OGA are still poorly understood, underscoring a crucial research gap that requires further investigation. Our study utilized a longitudinal approach and developed a moderated mediation model. From September 2021 to September 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic, data were collected from a sample of Chinese undergraduate students, with 367 participants at T1, 352 at T2, and 340 at T3. Participants completed online self-report surveys, providing valuable data on their levels of loneliness at T1, fear of missing out (FoMO) at T2, sensation seeking at T2, and OGA at T3. Our findings found that loneliness was positively linked to OGA. Further analysis demonstrated that FoMO partially mediated the link between loneliness and OGA. Meanwhile, sensation seeking moderated the pathway from FoMO to later OGA. Specifically, the effect of FoMO on OGA was significant for college students with high sensation seeking. This study offers longitudinal evidence linking loneliness and OGA, which has implications for the development of interventions to reduce OGA.",

        "Abstract": "Dwarfism is an important agronomic trait in fruit breeding programs. However, the germplasm resources required to generate dwarf pear (Pyrus spp.) varieties are limited. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying dwarfism remain unclear. In this study, \"Yunnan\" quince (Cydonia oblonga Mill.) had a dwarfing effect on \"Zaosu\" pear. Additionally, the dwarfism-related NAC transcription factor gene PbNAC71 was isolated from pear trees comprising \"Zaosu\" (scion) grafted onto \"Yunnan\" quince (rootstock). Transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana and pear OHF-333 (Pyrus communis) plants overexpressing PbNAC71 exhibited dwarfism, with a substantially smaller xylem and vessel area relative to the wild-type controls. Yeast one-hybrid, dual-luciferase, chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that PbNAC71 downregulates PbWalls are thin 1 expression by binding to NAC-binding elements in its promoter. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that PbNAC71 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase PbRING finger protein 217 (PbRNF217). Furthermore, PbRNF217 promotes the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PbNAC71 by the 26S proteasome, thereby regulating plant height as well as xylem and vessel development. Our findings reveal a mechanism underlying pear dwarfism and expand our understanding of the molecular basis of dwarfism in woody plants.",

        "Title": "Magnetic resonance imaging-based classification of the myodural bridge complex and its influencing factors.",
        "Abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation is considered the third circulation of the human body. Recently, some scholars have proposed the myodural bridge (MDB) as a novel power source for CSF flow. Moreover, the suboccipital muscles can exert a driving force on the CSF via the MDB. This hypothesis is directly supported by head rotation and nodding movements, which can affect CSF circulation. The MDB has been validated as a normal structure in humans and mammals. In addition, the fusion of MDB fibers of different origins that act in concert with each other forms the MDB complex (MDBC). The MDBC may be associated with several CSF disorder-related neurological disorders in clinical practice. Therefore, the morphology of the MDBC and its influencing factors must be determined. In this study, T2-weighted imaging sagittal images of the cervical region were analyzed retrospectively in 1085 patients, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typing of the MDBC was performed according to the imaging features of the MDBC in the posterior atlanto-occipital interspace (PAOiS) and posterior atlanto-axial interspace (PAAiS). The effects of age and age-related degenerative changes in the cervical spine on MRI staging of the MDBC were also determined. The results revealed four MRI types of the MDBC: type A (no MDBC hyposignal shadow connected to the dura mater in either the PAOiS or PAAiS), type B (MDBC hyposignal shadow connected to the dura mater in the PAOiS only), type C (MDBC hyposignal shadow connected to the dura mater in the PAAiS only), and type D (MDBC hyposignal shadow connected to the dura mater in both the PAOiS and PAAiS). The influencing factors for the MDBC typing were age (group), degree of intervertebral space stenosis, dorsal osteophytosis, and degenerative changes in the cervical spine (P\u2009<\u20090.05). With increasing age (10-year interval), the incidence of type B MDBC markedly decreased, whereas that of type A MDBC increased considerably. With the deepening of the degree of intervertebral space stenosis, the incidence of type C MDBC increased significantly, whereas that of type A MDBC decreased. In the presence of dorsal osteophytosis, the incidence of type C and D MDBCs significantly decreased, whereas that of type A increased. In the presence of protrusion of the intervertebral disc, the incidence of type B, C, and D MDBCs increased markedly, whereas that of type A MDBC decreased considerably, with cervical degenerative changes combined with spinal canal stenosis. Moreover, the incidence of both type C and D MDBCs increased, whereas that of type A MDBC decreased. Based on the MRI signal characteristics of the dural side of the MDBC, four types of the MDBC were identified. MDBC typing varies dynamically according to population distribution, depending on age and cervical degeneration (degree of intervertebral space stenosis, vertebral dorsal osteophytosis formation, simple protrusion of intervertebral disc, and cervical degeneration changes combined with spinal canal stenosis, except for the degree of protrusion of the intervertebral disc and the degree of spinal canal stenosis); however, it is not influenced by sex.",

        "Abstract": "The high mortality rate associated with gastric cancer (GC) has resulted in an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic targets for GC. This study aimed to investigate whether GAIP interacting protein, C terminus 1 (GIPC1) represents a therapeutic target and its regulating mechanism in GC. GIPC1 expression was elevated in GC tissues, liver metastasis tissues, and lymph node metastases. GIPC1 knockdown or GIPC1 blocking peptide blocked the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and inhibited the proliferation and migration of GC cells. Conversely, GIPC1 overexpression markedly activated the PDGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and promoted GC cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, platelet-derived growth factor subunit BB (PDGF-BB) cytokines and the AKT inhibitor attenuated the effect of differential GIPC1 expression. Moreover, GIPC1 silencing decreased tumor growth and migration in BALB/c nude mice, while GIPC1 overexpression had contrasting effects. Taken together, our findings suggest that GIPC1 functions as an oncogene in GC and plays a central role in regulating cell proliferation and migration via the PDGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Soil salinity results in oxidative stress and heavy losses to crop production. The S-acylated protein SALT TOLERANCE RECEPTOR-LIKE CYTOPLASMIC KINASE 1 (STRK1) phosphorylates and activates CATALASE C (CatC) to improve rice (Oryza sativa L.) salt tolerance, but the molecular mechanism underlying its S-acylation involved in salt signal transduction awaits elucidation. Here, we show that the DHHC-type zinc finger protein DHHC09 S-acylates STRK1 at Cys5, Cys10, and Cys14 and promotes salt and oxidative stress tolerance by enhancing rice H2O2-scavenging capacity. This modification determines STRK1 targeting to the plasma membrane or lipid nanodomains and is required for its function. DHHC09 promotes salt signaling from STRK1 to CatC via transphosphorylation, and its deficiency impairs salt signal transduction. Our findings demonstrate that DHHC09 S-acylates and anchors STRK1 to the plasma membrane to promote salt signaling from STRK1 to CatC, thereby regulating H2O2 homeostasis and improving salt stress tolerance in rice. Moreover, overexpression of DHHC09 in rice mitigates grain yield loss under salt stress. Together, these results shed light on the mechanism underlying the role of S-acylation in RLK/RLCK-mediated salt signal transduction and provide a strategy for breeding highly salt-tolerant rice.",

        "Title": "Vertical transmission of infectious aerosols through building toilet drainage system: An experimental study.",
        "Abstract": "The building's toilet drainage system has been identified as a potential route for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during outbreaks. This study employed agar-fluorescein sodium semi-solid as trace particles to investigate the possibility of vertical transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in drainage system. In both scenarios, where floor drains were all properly sealed or dried out, simulated faeces containing fluorescein sodium were flushed into the toilet bowl. Air sampling was conducted in each restroom, and differential pressure measurements at the floor drain locations were taken. The experimental results showed that when all floor drains were properly sealed, the differential pressure at each floor drain was 0. The fluorescein sodium-traced aerosol did not transmit through the drainage system to various floors, which significantly reduced the risk of infection for users through this route. However, when all floor drains dried out, toilet users above the neutral pressure layer (NPL) were at a high risk of virus infection. Due to the increasing maximum negative pressure at the floor drain above the NPL with ascending floor levels, users on each floor above the NPL faced an elevated infection risk in restrooms. Specifically, users on the top floor were exposed to infectious aerosols roughly 1.6 times that of the first floor above the NPL. Conversely, owing to the increasing maximum positive pressure at the floor drain below the NPL with descending floor levels, users below the NPL experienced a comparatively lower infection risk. This finding has important implications for understanding the vertical transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in residential or public building and can inform the development of effective control measures.",

        "Abstract": "The microorganisms in sediments play a crucial role in biogeochemical cycle processes, and numerous studies have shown that microbial community is closely related to environmental factors. However, the usability of sediment microorganisms to evaluate the eco-environment quality of rural rivers has not been adequately explored. This study investigated the distribution characteristics and response of sediment microorganisms to environmental parameters and benthic organisms. Based on the environmental parameters and benthic community indices, the 12 stations were divided into high-polluted group A, moderate-polluted group B and low-polluted group C. Station DG01 and DG02 in group A had the highest level of As and Ni pollution and nutrient concentration, and DG09 in group A had the lowest benthic diversity. Correspondingly, group A had the lowest abundance of Proteobacteria, which has a higher requirement for the environment than Planctomycetes. Group B had the highest sulfide level (97.45\u00a0mg/kg), and bacteria (Thiobacillus, Sulfurisoma and Sulfuritalea) with genes involved in sulfur cycling were more enriched in this group. Group C had the lowest level of total nitrogen (243.36\u00a0mg/kg), and Rhodanobacteraceae in Xanthomonadales might be a key bioindicator for low nitrogen. In addition, Chlorophyta was found to be more susceptible to heavy metals, and moreover co-occurrence networks showed that microeukaryotes were more sensitive to heavy metal pollution compared to benthic animals and prokaryotes. Therefore, this study suggested that benthic microorganisms especially microeukaryotes could be used as good indicators for evaluating the eco-environmental quality of rural rivers.",

        "Abstract": "Effective inhibition of macrophage activation is critical for resolving inflammation and restoring pulmonary function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study, we identified the dual-enhanced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) as a novel regulator of macrophage activation in COPD. Both COX-2 and sEH were found to be increased in patients and mice with COPD and in macrophages exposed to cigarette smoke extract. Pharmacological reduction of the COX-2 and sEH by 4-(5-phenyl-3-{3-[3-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-ureido]-propyl}-pyrazol-1-yl)-benzenesulfonamide (PTUPB) effectively prevented macrophage activation, downregulated inflammation-related genes, and reduced lung injury, thereby improving respiratory function in a mouse model of COPD induced by cigarette smoke and lipopolysaccharide. Mechanistically, enhanced COX-2/sEH triggered the activation of the NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3 inflammasome, leading to the cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 into its active form in macrophages and amplifying inflammatory responses. These findings demonstrate that targeting COX-2/sEH-mediated macrophage activation may be a promising therapeutic strategy for COPD. Importantly, our data support the potential use of the dual COX-2 and sEH inhibitor PTUPB as a therapeutic drug for the treatment of COPD.",

        "Abstract": "G-quadruplex (G4) is a four-stranded noncanonical DNA structure that has long been recognized as a potential hindrance to DNA replication. However, how replisomes effectively deal with G4s to avoid replication failure is still obscure. Here, using single-molecule and ensemble approaches, the consequence of the collision between bacteriophage T7 replisome and an intramolecular G4 located on either the leading or lagging strand is examined. It is found that the adjacent fork junctions induced by G4 formation incur the binding of T7 DNA polymerase (DNAP). In addition to G4, these inactive DNAPs present insuperable obstacles, impeding the progression of DNA synthesis. Nevertheless, T7 helicase can dismantle them and resolve lagging-strand G4s, paving the way for the advancement of the replication fork. Moreover, with the assistance of the single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) gp2.5, T7 helicase is also capable of maintaining a leading-strand G4 structure in an unfolded state, allowing for a fraction of T7 DNAPs to synthesize through without collapse. These findings broaden the functional repertoire of a replicative helicase and underscore the inherent G4 tolerance of a replisome.",

        "Abstract": "Diversity is omnipresent in natural and synthetic extended systems, the phenomenon of diversity-induced resonance (DIR), wherein a moderate degree of the diversity can provoke an optimal collective response, provides researchers a brand-new strategy to amplify and utilize the weak signal. As yet the relevant advances focus mostly on the ideal situations where the interactions among elements are uncorrelated with the physical proximity of agents. Such a consideration overlooks interactions mediated by the motion of agents in space. Here, we investigate the signal response of an ensemble of spatial mobile heterogeneous bistable oscillators with two canonical interacting modes: dynamic and preset. The oscillators are considered as mass points and perform random walks in a two-dimensional square plane. Under the dynamic scheme, the oscillators can only interact with other oscillators within a fixed vision radius. For the preset circumstance, the interaction among oscillators occurs only when all of them are in a predefined region at the same moment. We find that the DIR can be obtained in both situations. Additionally, the strength of resonance nonmonotonically rises with respect to the increase of moving speed, and the optimal resonance is acquired by an intermediate magnitude of speed. Finally, we propose reduced equations to guarantee the occurrence of such mobility-optimized DIR on the basis of the fast switching approximation theory and also examine the robustness of such phenomenon through the excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo model and a different spatial motion mechanism. Our results reveal for the first time that the DIR can be optimized by the spatial mobility and thus has promising potential application in the communication of mobile agents.",

        "Abstract": "The \"Yufen 1\" H line chicken (YF) has excellent characteristics including early sexual maturity and high egg production, and the conservation of its genetic diversity is the core of the breeding activity. To overcome misrepresented breeds and protect the integrity of the germplasm genetic resources, it is important to develop accurate and convenient methods to identify YF. In this study, whole genome resequencing was performed on the YF population, and bioinformatics analysis was conducted by combining the data from different breeds. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed that YF had the slowest LD-decay rate, suggesting strong natural and artificial selection in its history. Through selective sweep analysis, 1,126 selected regions in YF were identified, which contained 163,661 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In particular, 5 specific SNPs (SNP1: Chr2:45509616, SNP2: Chr2:45510792, SNP3: Chr9:13788193, SNP4: Chr9:13795646, SNP5: Chr9:13798154) were found exclusively in the YF population. Subsequently, PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of these 5 SNPs in YF. Finally, 4 SNPs (SNP1, SNP2, SNP4, SNP5) were screened and verified using the Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) typing technique. These SNPs can be used as specific molecular identity cards (IDs) for YF authentication. The present study is of great significance to ensure sustainable conservation and promotion of YF germplasm resources.",

        "Abstract": "Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) secretes effector proteins that enter plant cells and manipulate host processes. In a previous study, we identified a glycine-serine-rich effector PstGSRE4, which was proven to regulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway by interacting with TaCZSOD2. In this study, we further demonstrated that PstGSRE4 interacts with wheat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase TaGAPDH2, which is related to ROS signalling. In wheat, silencing of TaGAPDH2 by virus-induced gene silencing increased the accumulation of ROS induced by the Pst virulent race CYR31. Overexpression of TaGAPDH2 decreased the accumulation of ROS induced by the avirulent Pst race CYR23. In addition, TaGAPDH2 suppressed Pst candidate elicitor Pst322-triggered cell death by decreasing ROS accumulation in Nicotiana benthamiana. Knocking down TaGAPDH2 expression attenuated Pst infection, whereas overexpression of TaGAPDH2 promoted Pst infection, indicating that TaGAPDH2 is a negative regulator of plant defence. In N. benthamiana, PstGSRE4 stabilized TaGAPDH2 through inhibition of the 26S proteasome-mediated destabilization. Overall, these results suggest that TaGAPDH2 is hijacked by the Pst effector as a negative regulator of plant immunity to promote Pst infection in wheat.",

This study aimed to investigate the associations between all criteria air pollutants and hospitalization of cause-specific cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in China. We obtained data on CVD hospitalization events of four major categories and 12 specific diseases from 153 hospitals distributed in 20 provincial-level regions from 2013 to 2020. We adopted a time-stratified case-crossover study design using individual cases to capture the effect of short-term exposure to six criteria air pollutants on CVD hospitalizations, using conditional logistic regression models. More than 1.1 million CVD hospitalization events were included. The lag pattern exploration demonstrated the largest effect for six air pollutants on lag 0-1 day. PM",

        "Abstract": "Inclusion bodies (IBs) of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and contain internal structures termed \"IB-associated granules\" (IBAGs), where anti-termination factor M2-1 and viral mRNAs are concentrated. However, the mechanism of IBAG formation and the physiological function of IBAGs are unclear. Here, we found that the internal structures of RSV IBs are actual M2-1-free viral messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) condensates formed by secondary LLPS. Mechanistically, the RSV nucleoprotein (N) and M2-1 interact with and recruit PABP to IBs, promoting PABP to bind viral mRNAs transcribed in IBs by RNA-recognition motif and drive secondary phase separation. Furthermore, PABP-eIF4G1 interaction regulates viral mRNP condensate composition, thereby recruiting specific translation initiation factors (eIF4G1, eIF4E, eIF4A, eIF4B and eIF4H) into the secondary condensed phase to activate viral mRNAs for ribosomal recruitment. Our study proposes a novel LLPS-regulated translation mechanism during viral infection and a novel antiviral strategy via targeting on secondary condensed phase.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular diagnostics play an important role in illness detection, prevention, and treatment, and are vital in point-of-care test. In this investigation, a novel CRISPR/Cas12a based small-molecule detection platform was developed using Antibody-Controlled Cas12a Biosensor (ACCBOR), in which antibody would control the trans-cleavage activity of CRISPR/Cas12a. In this system, small-molecule was labeled around the PAM sites of no target sequence(NTS), and antibody would bind on the labeled molecule to prevent the combination of CRISPR/Cas12a, resulting the decrease of trans-cleavage activity. Biotin-, digoxin-, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH-VD3)-labeled NTS and corresponding binding protein were separately used to verify its preformance, showing great universality. Finally, one-pot detection of 25-OH-VD3 was developed, exhibiting high sensitivity and excellent specificity. The limit of detection could be 259.86\u00a0pg/mL in serum within 30\u00a0min. This assay platform also has the advantages of low cost, easy operation (one-pot method), and fast detection (\u223c30\u00a0min), would be a new possibilities for the highly sensitive detection of other small-molecule targets.",

        "Abstract": "Exosomes (EXOs) are considered natural nanoparticles which have been widely used as carriers for the treatment and diagnosis of various diseases. However, due to the non-specific uptake, the unmodified EXOs cannot effectively deliver the vector to the target site. In this study, we used pDisplay vector to engineer Glypican-3 (GPC3) single-chain scFv antibody to the exosome surface, and the effect of engineered exosomes on the proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells was determined by a series of in vitro experiments as well as in vivo mouse xenograft model and PDX model. Furthermore, we established an improved delivery system by engineering single-chain scFv antibody against GPC3 on the EXO surface for a more efficient HCC targeting. Moreover, the delivery system was loaded with IR780 and Lenvatinib for a combination of thermotherapy and chemotherapy. Our results revealed that the antibody-engineered exosomes enabled rapid imaging of HCC xenograft models post IR780 loading and showed significant anti-tumor photothermal therapy (PTT) effects after irradiation. Since dual loading of IR780 and Lenvatinib in exosomes required only a single injection and had a maximal efficacy against cancer cells, our findings highlight the clinical application of using GPC3 single-chain scFv antibody-engineered exosomes loaded with IR780 and Lenvartinib to achieve the imaging and the treatment of HCC from the combined effect of IR780-induced PTT and Lenvatinib-induced chemotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "Rare disease patients often endure prolonged diagnostic odysseys and may still remain undiagnosed for years. Selecting the appropriate genetic tests is crucial to lead to timely diagnosis. Phenotypic features offer great potential for aiding genomic diagnosis in rare disease cases. We see great promise in effective integration of phenotypic information into genetic test selection workflow. In this study, we present a phenotype-driven molecular genetic test recommendation (Phen2Test) for pediatric rare disease diagnosis. Phen2Test was constructed using frequency matrix of phecodes and demographic data from the EHR before ordering genetic tests, with the objective to streamline the selection of molecular genetic tests (whole-exome / whole-genome sequencing, or gene panels) for clinicians with minimum genetic training expertise. We developed and evaluated binary classifiers based on 1,005 individuals referred to genetic counselors for potential genetic evaluation. In the evaluation using the gold standard cohort, the model achieved strong performance with an AUROC of 0.82 and an AUPRC of 0.92. Furthermore, we tested the model on another silver standard cohort (n=6,458), achieving an overall AUROC of 0.72 and an AUPRC of 0.671. Phen2Test was adjusted to align with current clinical guidelines, showing superior performance with more recent data, demonstrating its potential for use within a learning healthcare system as a genomic medicine intervention that adapts to guideline updates. This study showcases the practical utility of phenotypic features in recommending molecular genetic tests with performance comparable to clinical geneticists. Phen2Test could assist clinicians with limited genetic training and knowledge to order appropriate genetic tests.",

        "Title": "Air pollution may increase the sleep apnea severity: A nationwide analysis of smart device-based monitoring.",
        "Abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can lead to sleep deprivation, accidents, and cardiovascular diseases. However, research on the short-term effects of air pollutants on OSA severity is limited and inconsistent. We conducted a novel case time series analysis using a nationwide dataset among Huawei smart device users to assess the association between air pollution and OSA severity in a population at moderate-to-severe risk of OSA. Fixed-effects regression models were used to assess the associations between air pollution and the risk of OSA exacerbation, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and oxygen saturation. A total of 51,842 participants who were at moderate-to-severe risk of OSA (mean age [SD]: 45.4 [11.0], 95.5% male) were included, with 6,232,056 person-days of monitoring. The associations of fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide with OSA severity could occur during the sleep period, and last for 2\u00a0days. An increase of 1 interquartile range in the moving average concentrations of air pollution during the sleep period and the 2 previous days was associated with a 1.14%-4.31% increase in the risk of OSA exacerbation, an increase in AHI by 0.05-0.17 events/h, and a decrease in oxygen saturation (%) by 0.003-0.014. The exposure-response curves were almost linear. The associations between air pollutants and OSA were consistently stronger in participants aged 45 years or older. By virtue of the smart device-based technology, this large-scale, nationwide, longitudinal study provides compelling evidence that short-term exposure to air pollution may worsen sleep apnea. Our findings highlight the significance of ongoing efforts to improve air quality in mitigating OSA severity and the relevant disease burden in an aging era.",

        "Abstract": "Bumblebees have been considered one of the most important pollinators on the planet. However, recent reports of bumblebee decline have raised concern about a significant threat to ecosystem stability. Infectious diseases caused by multiple pathogen infections have been increasingly recognized as an important mechanism behind this decline worldwide. Understanding the determining factors that influence the assembly and composition of pathogen communities among bumblebees can provide important implications for predicting infectious disease dynamics and making effective conservation policies. Here, we study the relative importance of biotic interactions versus interspecific host resistance in shaping the pathogen community composition of bumblebees in China. We first conducted a comprehensive survey of 13 pathogens from 22 bumblebee species across China. We then applied joint species distribution modeling to assess the determinants of pathogen community composition and examine the presence and strength of pathogen-pathogen associations. We found that host species explained most of the variations in pathogen occurrences and composition, suggesting that host specificity was the most important variable in predicting pathogen occurrences and community composition in bumblebees. Moreover, we detected both positive and negative associations among pathogens, indicating the role of competition and facilitation among pathogens in determining pathogen community assembly. Our research demonstrates the power of a pluralistic framework integrating field survey of bumblebee pathogens with community ecology frameworks to understand the underlying mechanisms of pathogen community assembly.",

Strain SCSIO 13291 was labeled with 5 (and -\u20096)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, succinimidyl ester and the labeled cell suspension directly inoculated onto the coral polyp tissues when nubbins were under thermal stress in a mesocosm experiment.

        "Abstract": "To enhance phenotype recognition in clinical notes of genetic diseases, we developed two models - PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT - for expanding the vocabularies of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. While HPO offers a standardized vocabulary for phenotypes, existing tools often fail to capture the full scope of phenotypes, due to limitations from traditional heuristic or rule-based approaches. Our models leverage large language models (LLMs) to automate the detection of phenotype terms, including those not in the current HPO. We compared these models to PhenoTagger, another HPO recognition tool, and found that our models identify a wider range of phenotype concepts, including previously uncharacterized ones. Our models also showed strong performance in case studies on biomedical literature. We evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of BERT-based and GPT-based models in aspects such as architecture and accuracy. Overall, our models enhance automated phenotype detection from clinical texts, improving downstream analyses on human diseases.",

        "Title": "Risk evaluation of venue types and human behaviors of COVID-19 outbreaks in public indoor environments: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "Abstract": "Despite increasing vaccination rates, the incidence of breakthrough infections with COVID-19 has increased due to the continued emergence of new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Therefore, Non-pharmaceutical interventions remain the most effective measures for coping with the ever-changing pandemic. The lifting of compulsory interventions has made individuals primary responsibility for their own health, which highlights the importance of increasing awareness of the infection risk from the environment in which they live and their individual behaviors. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus on April 17, 2023, for all studies reporting COVID-19 outbreaks in public indoor venues. The study outcome was the attack rate. A total of 42 studies, which included cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, and case studies, reporting data on 1951 confirmed cases in 64 COVID-19 outbreaks satisfied the meta-analysis and were included in the review. A random-effect model was used in the meta-analysis, and subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate factors affecting attack rates. We found a strong level of evidence (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) supporting a higher pooled attack rate in recreation-related venues (0.44, 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.60) than in work-related venues (0.21, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.27). Compared to those outbreaks without that, outbreaks with high-intensity exercise, vocalization, contact behavior, or close body proximity had a higher attack rate of 0.51, 0.55, 0.33, and 0.39, respectively. Further studies suggest that different attack rates across different types of settings may be the result of heterogeneity in exposed people's behaviors. There were significant heterogeneities that may limit the interpretation of connections between influencing factors and outbreak outcomes. The identification of key behaviors that may contribute to transmission risk, and their correlation with venue type, has important implications for the development of future public health interventions and individual prevention strategies for respiratory infectious diseases such as COVID-19.",

        "Abstract": "Nanoplastics and heavy metals are common pollutants in coastal environments with high concerns, but their joint ecological risk to marine primary productivity remains unclear. In this study, the effects of 7, 70, 700\u00a0\u03bcg/L lead (Pb) single exposure and in combination with 200\u00a0\u03bcg/L polystyrene nanoplastics (NPs, 70\u00a0nm) on marine microalga Platymonas helgolandica were investigated. Pb single exposure induced a dose-dependent inhibition on the growth of P. helgolandica, which was associated with the reduced photosynthetic efficiency and nutrient accumulation. Compared to Pb single exposure, the addition of NPs significantly reduced the photosynthetic efficiency and aggravated the damage to cell structure. Reduced esterase activity and increased membrane permeability also indicated that NPs exacerbated the adverse effects of Pb on P. helgolandica. Thus, co-exposure to NPs and Pb induced more severe impacts on marine microalgae, suggesting that the joint ecological risk of NPs and heavy metals to marine primary productivity merits more attention.",

In recent years, considering the unsatisfied benefits of pharmacological therapies, non-pharmacological therapy has become a research hotspot for AD intervention. Terahertz (THz) waves with a range between microwave and infrared regions in the electromagnetic spectrum and high permeability to a wide range of materials have great potential in the bioengineering\u00a0field. However, its biological impacts on the central nervous system, under either physiological or pathological conditions, are poorly investigated. In this study, we first measured the 0.14 THz waves penetration across the skull of a C57BL/6 mouse and found the percentage of THz penetration to be ~70%, guaranteeing that THz waves can reach the relevant brain regions. We then exposed the APP",

To investigate the relationship between the electron-donor substitution and luminescent properties of ESIPT luminogens, four 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole derivatives with donor-\u03c0-acceptor (D-\u03c0-A)-structured were synthesized. The distinct fluorescence properties of them were found to be highly dependent on the electron-donor moiety (triphenylamine and anthracenyl), its substituent position (para and meta position) and solvent polarity. The M-TPA, P-En, and M-En showed ESIPT emission in organic solvents, while the P-TPA showed intramolecular charge transfer process (ICT) emission. It is due to the synergistic effect of the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and ESIPT, that M-TPA and M-En exhibited high solid-state quantum yields and large Stokes shifts. They were used as a probe for detecting F",

        "Abstract": "African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) infection causes an acute and highly contagious disease in swine, resulting in significant economic losses and societal harm worldwide. Currently, there are no effective vaccines or antiviral drugs available for ASFV. Tetrandrine (TET) is extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Stephania tetrandrae, possesses diverse biological functions such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and antiviral activities. The study comprehensively evaluated the anti-ASFV effect of TET and validated it through biological assays. The dose-dependent inhibition of TET against ASFV was confirmed and a novel mechanism of TET's anti-ASFV activity was elucidated. TET effectively inhibits ASFV during internalization by blocking macropinocytosis through the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. The specific inhibitor LY294002, targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway, exhibits similar antiviral activity against ASFV as TET. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of TET against other viruses such as Lumpy Skin Disease Virus (LSDV) and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) was also identified. Our findings suggest that TET effectively inhibits ASFV and reveal the potential for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Childhood anemia constitutes a global public health problem, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, it remains unknown whether global warming has an impact on childhood anemia. Here, we examined the association between annual temperatures and childhood anemia prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa and then projected childhood anemia burden attributable to climate change. Each 1\u00b0C increment in annual temperature was associated with increased odds of childhood anemia (odd ratio = 1.138, 95% confidence interval: 1.134-1.142). Compared with the baseline period (1985-2014), the attributable childhood anemia cases would increase by 7,597 per 100,000 person-years under a high-emission scenario in the 2090s, which would be almost 2-fold and over 3-fold more than those projected in moderate- and low-emission scenarios. Our results reveal the vulnerabilities and inequalities of children for the excess burden of anemia due to climate warming and highlight the importance of climate mitigation and adaptation strategies in LMICs.",

        "Abstract": "As large-scale genomic screening becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding the influence of actionable results on healthcare utilization is key to estimating the potential long-term clinical impact. The eMERGE network sequenced individuals for actionable genes in multiple genetic conditions and returned results to individuals, providers, and the electronic health record. Differences in recommended health services (laboratory, imaging, and procedural testing) delivered within 12\u00a0months of return were compared among individuals with pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) findings to matched individuals with negative findings before and after return of results. Of 16,218 adults, 477 unselected individuals were found to have a monogenic risk for arrhythmia (n\u00a0= 95), breast cancer (n\u00a0= 96), cardiomyopathy (n\u00a0= 95), colorectal cancer (n\u00a0= 105), or familial hypercholesterolemia (n\u00a0= 86). Individuals with P/LP results more frequently received services after return (43.8%) compared to before return (25.6%) of results and compared to individuals with negative findings (24.9%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The annual cost of qualifying healthcare services increased from an average of $162 before return to $343 after return of results among the P/LP group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001); differences in the negative group were non-significant. The mean difference-in-differences was $149 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), which describes the increased cost within the P/LP group corrected for cost changes in the negative group. When stratified by individual conditions, significant cost differences were observed for arrhythmia, breast cancer, and cardiomyopathy. In conclusion, less than half of individuals received billed health services after monogenic return, which modestly increased healthcare costs for payors in the year following return.",

        "Abstract": "\u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) is a presynaptic protein that is involved in Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases and binds to negatively charged phospholipids. Previously, we reported that \u03b1-Syn clusters synthetic proteoliposomes that mimic synaptic vesicles. This vesicle-clustering activity depends on a specific interaction of \u03b1-Syn with anionic phospholipids. Here, we report that \u03b1-Syn surprisingly also interacts with the neutral phospholipid lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC). Even in the absence of anionic lipids, lysoPC facilitates \u03b1-Syn-induced vesicle clustering but has no effect on Ca",

        "Abstract": "Many cancers harbor homologous recombination defects (HRDs). A HRD is a therapeutic target that is being successfully utilized in treatment of breast/ovarian cancer via synthetic lethality. However, canonical HRD caused by BRCAness mutations do not prevail in liver cancer. Here we report a subtype of HRD caused by the perturbation of a proteasome variant (CDW19S) in hepatitis B virus-bearing (HBV-bearing) cells. This amalgamate protein complex contained the 19S proteasome decorated with CRL4WDR70 ubiquitin ligase, and assembled at broken chromatin in a PSMD4Rpn10- and ATM-MDC1-RNF8-dependent manner. CDW19S promoted DNA end processing via segregated modules that promote nuclease activities of MRE11 and EXO1. Contrarily, a proteasomal component, ADRM1Rpn13, inhibited resection and was removed by CRL4WDR70-catalyzed ubiquitination upon commitment of extensive resection. HBx interfered with ADRM1Rpn13 degradation, leading to the imposition of ADRM1Rpn13-dependent resection barrier and consequent viral HRD subtype distinguishable from that caused by BRCA1 defect. Finally, we demonstrated that viral HRD in HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma can be exploited to restrict tumor progression. Our work clarifies the underlying mechanism of a virus-induced HRD subtype.",

        "Abstract": "The epidemic of Mpox virus (MPXV) from May 2022 was once declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization. Vaccines play an important role in prevention of infectious diseases, and mRNA vaccine technology was proved to be a safe and effective platform with successful application in defense of coronavirus disease 2019. In this study, based on A29L, M1R, A35R, and B6R of MPXV, we developed two MPXV mRNA vaccine candidates, designated as MPXfus and MPXmix. The MPXfus was one-component, in which these four antigen proteins were linked in tandem by flexible linker and encoded by an individual mRNA as a fusion protein. The MPXmix was multicomponent containing four mRNA, and each mRNA encoded one antigen protein respectively. Mice were immunized with equal quality of MPXfus or MPXmix, delivered by lipid nanoparticles for evaluation and comparison of the immune responses induced by these two MPXV vaccine candidates. Results of immune response analyses indicated that both MPXfus and MPXmix could elicit high-level of antigen-specific antibodies and robust cellular immune response in mice. Moreover, results of virus neutralization assays suggested that sera from MPXfus- or MPXmix-immunized mice possessed high neutralizing activities against vaccinia virus. In addition, titers of antigen-specific antibody, levels of cellular immune response, and activities of neutralizing antibody against vaccinia virus induced by MPXfus and MPXmix presented no significant difference. In summary, this study provides valuable insights for further clinical development of one-component and multicomponent mRNA vaccine candidates for the prevention of MPXV and other orthomyxoviruses.",

        "Abstract": "Sleep-dependent consolidation is important for novel word learning, but previous studies have neglected the potential modulating role of learning environments. The present study examines sleep-dependent consolidation effects by comparing learning in a virtual reality (VR) environment and in a traditional picture-word (PW) environment. Two groups of Chinese-English bilinguals were randomly assigned to a VR or PW environment. In both learning environments, they learned novel words in Korean, a language with which they had no prior experience. All participants learned one set of novel words on Day 1 and another set on Day 2. An explicit recognition task and an implicit primed lexical-decision task were employed to measure sleep-dependent consolidation effects from the two environments. Results revealed sleep-dependent consolidation effects in both explicit and implicit measures, but only the primed lexical-decision task showed an influence of learning environment, suggesting that novel words learned via VR had better consolidation. Taken together, our findings suggest that a VR environment that fosters a rich sensory experience facilitates sleep-dependent consolidation effects. We argue that these results provide new evidence and implications for the complementary learning system (CLS) model.",

        "Abstract": "Exosomes are membrane-bound extracellular vesicles released following the fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the cell membrane. Exosomes transport diverse molecules, including proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA, and regulate distant intercellular communication. Noncoding RNA (ncRNAs) carried by exosomes regulate cell-cell communication in tissues, including adipose tissue. This review summarizes the action mechanisms of ncRNAs carried by exosomes on adipocyte differentiation and modulation of adipogenesis by exosomal ncRNAs.

        "Title": "Predicting regional somatic mutation rates using DNA motifs.",
        "Abstract": "How the locus-specificity of epigenetic modifications is regulated remains an unanswered question. A contributing mechanism is that epigenetic enzymes are recruited to specific loci by DNA binding factors recognizing particular sequence motifs (referred to as epi-motifs). Using these motifs to predict biological outputs depending on local epigenetic state such as somatic mutation rates would confirm their functionality. Here, we used DNA motifs including known TF motifs and epi-motifs as a surrogate of epigenetic signals to predict somatic mutation rates in 13 cancers at an average 23kbp resolution. We implemented an interpretable neural network model, called contextual regression, to successfully learn the universal relationship between mutations and DNA motifs, and uncovered motifs that are most impactful on the regional mutation rates such as TP53 and epi-motifs associated with H3K9me3. Furthermore, we identified genomic regions with significantly higher mutation rates than the expected values in each individual tumor and demonstrated that such cancer-related regions can accurately predict cancer types. Interestingly, we found that the same mutation signatures often have different contributions to cancer-related and cancer-independent regions, and we also identified the motifs with the most contribution to each mutation signature.",

        "Abstract": "Microwave absorbers with high efficiency and mechanical robustness are urgently desired to cope with more complex and harsh application scenarios. However, manipulating the trade-off between microwave absorption performance and mechanical properties is seldom realized in microwave absorbers. Here, a chemistry-tailored charge dynamic engineering strategy is proposed for sparking hetero-interfacial polarization and thus coordinating microwave attenuation ability with the interfacial bonding, endowing polymer-based composites with microwave absorption efficiency and mechanical toughness. The absorber designed by this new conceptual approach exhibits remarkable Ku-band microwave absorption efficiency (-55.3\u00a0dB at a thickness of 1.5\u00a0mm) and satisfactory effective absorption bandwidth (5.0\u00a0GHz) as well as desirable interfacial shear strength (97.5\u00a0MPa). The calculated differential charge density depicts the uneven distribution of space charge and the intense hetero-interfacial polarization, clarifying the structure-performance relationship from a theoretical perspective. This work breaks through traditional single performance-oriented design methods and ushers a new direction for next-generation microwave absorbers.",

        "Title": "A novel low sampling rate and cost-efficient active sampler for medium/long-term monitoring of gaseous pollutants.",
        "Abstract": "Active sampling is a dependable approach for gaseous pollutants monitoring, offering high accuracy and precision that is unaffected by environmental factors such as wind and temperature in comparison to passive sampling. To measure long-term average concentrations while minimizing the use of materials, a reduced sampling rate is necessary. Thus, this study aims to develop a novel low sampling rate (down to 1\u00a0mL/min) and cost-efficient active sampler (LASP) for medium/long-term monitoring of gaseous pollutants. The LASP mainly consisted of a syringe pump, a Y-shaped fitting with two one-way valves, and a control unit for intermittent operation. Results showed that LASP can obtain a sampling rate of less than 1\u00a0mL/min and sampling rate exhibited a high level of stability. Daily average concentrations measurements for nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde by LASP had normalized mean biases of 2.8% and 5.2%, respectively. These numbers were -\u00a05.8% and 6.1% for weekly-average samplings. This study demonstrated applications of LASP in real outdoor (daily-average) and indoor (weekly-average) air quality measurements. It worked well with low noise levels, and without interfering with occupants' daily activities. LASP can assist in improving our ability to monitor air quality and pollutants emissions, thereby supporting health research and policy development. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATION: Gaseous air pollution is an important hazardous factor threatening human health. Medium/long-term air quality monitoring is essential for outdoor and indoor air quality assessment and control. However, air sampler for medium/long-term sampling is lacking. This study developed a novel low sampling rate and cost-efficient active sampler and applied it to medium/long-term air sampling. The sampler can work at a sampling rate of less than 1\u00a0mL/min. This technology provides a feasible strategy for medium/long-term monitoring of gaseous air pollutants in both environments and emission hotspots.",

        "Abstract": "Herein, we introduce a p-type redox conjugated covalent organic polymer (p-PNZ) as a universal and high-rate cathode for diverse dual-ion batteries. By constructing an n-type redox counterpart (n-PNZ) with an analogous reticular structure and redox-site composition, we also attain a comparative platform to probe how the redox-site nature and counterion chemistry affect the rate performance of polymer cathodes. It is disclosed that the charge dilution in p-type redox sites and bulky anions engenders their weak interaction and rapid anion diffusion in electrodes, while the trivial interaction of the solvent with anions facilitates anion desolvation and interfacial charge transfer. Thus, p-PNZ possesses rapid surface-controlled redox kinetics with a high anion diffusion coefficient regardless of its inferior porosity and conductivity relative to n-PNZ. Along with a long cycle life of over 50000 cycles, the p-PNZ-engaged Zn-based dual-ion battery with a dilute electrolyte delivers nearly constant capacities of \u223c149 mAh g",

An increasing number of studies are focusing on the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) in intramuscular adipocyte differentiation. However, little is known about the association of miR-128-3p with intramuscular adipocyte differentiation. Our previous RNA-seq results indicated that miR-128-3p was differentially expressed at different periods in chicken intramuscular adipocytes, revealing a possible association with intramuscular adipogenesis. The purpose of this research was to investigate the biological functions and regulatory mechanism of miR-128-3p in chicken intramuscular adipogenesis.",

Our strategy creates a unique interconnected network of strongly-coupled donor 3-(acceptor-core) octupoles in Cyano-OCF-EO, affording enhanced intramolecular charge transfer, substantial active sites and crowded open channels. This enables Cyano-OCF-EO as a new versatile separator modifier, which endows the modified separator with superior catalytic activity for sulfur conversion and rapid Li ion conduction with the high Li",

        "Abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus is one of the most common endocrine diseases that occur during pregnancy. Disorders of blood glucose metabolism during pregnancy can increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as pregnancy-related hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, miscarriage, macrosomia, and neonatal hypoglycemia. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can safely and effectively monitor blood glucose changes in patients with gestational hyperglycemia, thereby reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes. Hence, this article aimed to provide a comprehensive review of the progress and indications for using CGM in pregnant patients with diabetes. CGM can reduce blood glucose fluctuations and the occurrence of serious hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia events and can provide time in range (TIR). TIR is an important indicator of blood glucose level. Patients with a higher TIR during pregnancy have better gestational outcomes.",

        "Title": "Transplantation of endothelial progenitor cells improves myocardial hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats through HO-1/CREB3/AKT axis.",
        "Abstract": "Hypertensive myocardial hypertrophy produces a hostile microenvironment characterized by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, inflammation and oxidative stress, which also leads to endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) dysfunction, preventing EPC migration, adhesion and angiogenesis. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an intracellular protein that plays an important role in angiogenesis and cell survival. The upregulation of cAMP response element-binding protein 3 (CREB3) is closely related to the formation of endothelial cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of HO-1 and CREB3 in EPCs and their effects on hypertensive myocardial hypertrophy. EPCs were transfected with HO-1 adenoviral overexpression vector (Ad-HO-1) or together with CREB3 siRNA (si-CREB3), or transfected with CREB3 adenoviral overexpression vector (Ad-CREB3) or together with HO-1 siRNA, and then treated with 100\u00a0nM Ang \u2161 for 12\u00a0h. Overexpressing HO-1 or CREB3 promoted adhesion to extracellular matrix, cell migration, and angiogenesis, inhibited the secretion of inflammatory factors TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, and reduced ROS level, ICAM-1 and MCP-1 mRNA expression levels in EPCs treated with Ang \u2161. Online prediction and Co-IP assay showed that HO-1 interacts with CREB3, and they promote expression of each other. EPC-conditioned medium supplemented with CREB3 recombinant protein decreased the levels of ANP and BNP mRNA in H9C2 cells treated with Ang \u2161 and alleviated oxidative stress. Ad-CREB3 transfected EPCs promoted the phosphorylation of AKT in vivo and in vitro, thereby improving myocardial swelling and dysfunction in SHR rats. Taken together, transplantation of CREB3 overexpressing EPCs alleviates myocardial hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats by promoting HO-1 protein expression and AKT phosphorylation.",

        "Abstract": "Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is highly toxic, widely distributed, and difficult to monitor, posing a serious threat to human health. Therefore, a highly sensitive, rapid, convenient, and low-cost detection method must be urgently established. In this study, a triple strategy-enhanced immunochromatographic assay (ICA) was developed to satisfy these detection requirements. First, a turn-on signal output mode of the fluorescence quenching ICA substituted the turn-off mode of the traditional ICA for sensitive response to trace AFM1, with the limit of detection (LOD) reduced by approximately 4.9-fold. Then, a novel Au and polydopamine (PDA) cogrowth chrysanthemum-like blackbody was prepared as the quenching probe to reduce the background signal. This probe combined the excellent properties of Au nanoparticles with PDA. Thus, its fluorescence quenching constant was higher than that of single Au and PDA nanoparticles by 25.8- and 4.9-fold, respectively. Furthermore, an aggregation-induced emission fluorescence microsphere with a 5.7-fold higher relative quantum yield than a commercial fluorescence microsphere was selected as the signal output carrier to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The integration of the above triple strategies established a 53.4-fold sensitivity-enhanced fluorescence quenching ICA (LOD = 0.9\u00a0pg/mL) for detecting AFM1 in milk, providing a strong technical guarantee for the safety monitoring of milk products.",

        "Abstract": "The cause of ulcerative colitis (UC) is not yet fully understood. Previous research has pointed towards a potential role for mutations in nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) in promoting the onset and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by altering the microbiota of the gut. However, the relationship between toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and gut microbiota in IBD is not well understood. To shed light on this, the interaction between TLR4 and gut microbiota was studied using a mouse model of IBD.",

To address this issue, we designed a novel drug delivery system named GDMCN2,which uses iron-based metal organic framework (Fe-MOF) nanocages encased in a covalent organic framework (COF) and modified with the pancreatic cancer-specific antibody, NRP2. After being targeted into tumor cells, GDMCN2\u00a0gradually release the sonosensitizer sinoporphyrin sodium (DVDMS) and chemotherapeutic gemcitabine (GEM) and simultaneously generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultrasound (US) irradiation. This system can overcome gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer and reduce its toxicity to non-targeted cells and tissues. In a mechanistic cascade, the release of ROS activates the mitochondrial transition pore (MPTP), leading to the release of Ca",

This review aims to provide an in-depth overview on the complexity of amyloid fibrils' structural polymorphism and its implications in disease pathogenesis. We firstly decipher the molecular rules governing the structural polymorphism of amyloid fibrils. We then discuss pivotal factors that contribute to the assortment of fibril structural polymorphs, including post-translational modifications (PTMs), disease mutations, and interacting molecules, and elucidate the structural basis of how these determinants influence amyloid fibril polymorphism. Furthermore, we underscore the need for a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between diverse fibril polymorphs and pathological activities, as well as their potential roles in therapeutic applications.",

        "Abstract": "Hierarchical pores are important structural components of the bone tissue and are closely related to angiogenesis, nutrient transport, and metabolism involved in the repair of a bone defect. Here, we fabricated a composite scaffold having a hierarchical structure, based on micro-nano bioactive glass (MNBG) incorporated into poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and with camphene as a pore-forming agent for bone repair. The results showed that camphene formed abundant micropores in the walls of large pores, resulting in hierarchical pore structures ranging from a few microns to a hundred microns. Moreover, there was 2-3 folds increased in compressive modulus and the scaffolds showed a stable degradation rate and a higher degree of apatite crystallization than ordinary porous scaffolds. The results of in vitro studies showed that, when compared to ordinary porous scaffolds, PLGA-MNBG scaffolds with multi-holes could better promote the proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and the expression of angiogenic marker (CD31) of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).",

Here, we report for the first time an intrinsic strain-mediated ultrathin ceria nanoantioxidant. Surface strain in ceria with variable thicknesses and coordinatively unsaturated Ce sites was investigated by theoretical calculation analysis and then was validated by preparing \u223c1.2 nm ultrathin nanoplates with \u223c3.0% tensile strain in plane/\u223c10.0% tensile strain out of plane. Compared with nanocubes, surface strain in ultrathin nanoplates could enhance the covalency of the Ce-O bond, leading to increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD)-mimetic activity by \u223c2.6-fold (1533 U/mg, in close proximity to that of natural SOD) and total antioxidant activity by \u223c2.5-fold. As a proof of concept, intrinsic strain-mediated ultrathin ceria nanoplates could boost antioxidation for improved ischemic stroke treatment ",

        "Abstract": "The reproductive performance of breeder roosters has significant economic importance in the poultry industry. Breeder roosters have severely reduced semen quality with age and will be at risk of culling in the following years. In order to extend the use of breeder roosters, we drew on the induced molting model of hens and selected 35 Houdan roosters aged 50 wk for induced molting. By comparing the body weight, testicular weight, semen quality, and reproductive performance before and after induced molting, we found that induced molting could restore the body weight and testicular weight to the levels before molting (P > 0.05). At the same time, it significantly improved sperm motility (P < 0.05) and also improved reproductive performance such as fertilization rate and hatching rate. To further reveal the mechanism underlying the effects of induced molting on semen quality and reproductive performance in aged Houdan roosters, we collected testes from 3 periods: 1 d before fasting (F0), 15 d after fasting (F15), and 32 d after recovery feeding (R32) for transcriptome sequencing analysis. A total of 5,671 genes were detected in F0, F15, and R32, and trend analysis of the 5,671 differential genes showed 2 significant trends (profile 5 and profile 2). KEGG enrichment analysis of the genes in the 2 profiles, revealed significantly enriched pathway regulation of actin cytoskeleton. In the regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathway, we found a protein kinase gene (SRC) and a senescence gene (ROCK2). SRC was highly expressed at F15, leading to the phosphorylation of key substrates, which in turn disrupted the Sertoli cell spermatid connection and the spermiogenesis process, resulting in no mature spermatozoa produced from F15, SRC expression was inhibited at R32, the expression level was reduced, and mature spermatozoa reappeared. The senescence gene ROCK2 was highly expressed at F15 compared to F0 and R32, which may have been responsible for inducing senescence atrophy in the testes.",

        "Abstract": "Monkeypox (mpox) is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the mpox virus. Mpox symptoms are similar to smallpox with less severity and lower mortality. As yet mpox virus is not characterized by as high transmissibility as some severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, still, it is spreading, especially among men who have sex with men (MSM). Thus, taking preventive measures, such as vaccination, is highly recommended. While the smallpox vaccine has demonstrated considerable efficacy against the mpox virus due to the antigenic similarities, the development of a universal anti-mpox vaccine remains a necessary pursuit. Recently, nucleic acid vaccines have garnered special attention owing to their numerous advantages compared to traditional vaccines. Importantly, DNA vaccines have certain advantages over mRNA vaccines. In this study, a potentially universal DNA vaccine candidate against mpox based on conserved epitopes was designed and its efficacy was evaluated ",

        "Abstract": "Helium, the second most abundant element in the universe, exhibits an extremely large electronic band gap of about 20 eV at ambient pressures. While the metallization pressure of helium has been accurately determined, thus far little attention has been paid to the specific mechanisms driving the band-gap closure and electronic properties of this quantum crystal in the terapascal regime (1 TPa\u2009=\u200910 Mbar). Here, we employ density functional theory and many-body perturbation calculations to fill up this knowledge gap. It is found that prior to reaching metallicity helium becomes an excitonic insulator (EI), an exotic state of matter in which electrostatically bound electron-hole pairs may form spontaneously. Furthermore, we predict metallic helium to be a superconductor with a critical temperature of\u2009\u2248\u200920 K just above its metallization pressure and of\u2009\u2248\u200970 K at 100 TPa. These unforeseen phenomena may be critical for improving our fundamental understanding and modeling of celestial bodies.",

        "Title": "Cadmium exposure promotes ferroptosis by upregulating Heat Shock Protein 70 in vascular endothelial damage of zebrafish.",
        "Abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) exposure is a risk factor for endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. Ferroptosis is a type of cell death that relies on lipid peroxidation. Whether ferroptosis acts in Cd-induced vascular endothelial damage and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we found that Cd resulted in ferroptosis of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in vivo and in vitro. In the visualized zebrafish embryos, Cd accumulated in vascular ECs, ROS and lipid peroxidation levels were increased, and the oxidoreductase system was disturbed after exposure. Moreover, Cd decreased Gpx4 in ECs and caused smaller mitochondria with increased membrane density. Accompanied by ferroptosis, the number of ECs and the area of the caudal venous plexus in zebrafish embryos were reduced, and the survival rate of HUVECs decreased. These effects were partially reversed by ferrostatin-1 and aggravated by erastin. Mechanistically, an excessive increase in Heat Shock Protein 70 (Hsp70) was identified by transcriptomics after Cd exposure. Inhibition of Hsp70 by VER-155008 or siRNA ameliorated Cd-induced ferroptosis, thereby alleviating endothelial injury. Furthermore, Hsp70 regulated Cd-induced ferroptosis by targeting multiple targets, including Gpx4, Fth1, Nrf2 and Acsl4. Our findings provide a new approach to investigating the endothelial damage of Cd and indicate that regulation of Hsp70 is an important target for alleviating this process.",

        "Title": "ASH2L regulates postnatal neurogenesis through Onecut2-mediated inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway.",
        "Abstract": "The ability of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) to proliferate and differentiate is required through different stages of neurogenesis. Disturbance in the regulation of neurogenesis causes many neurological diseases, such as intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. However, the intrinsic mechanisms of this regulation in neurogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we report that Ash2l (Absent, small or homeotic discs-like 2), one core component of a multimeric histone methyltransferase complex, is essential for NSPC fate determination during postnatal neurogenesis. Deletion of Ash2l in NSPCs impairs their capacity for proliferation and differentiation, leading to simplified dendritic arbors in adult-born hippocampal neurons and deficits in cognitive abilities. RNA sequencing data reveal that Ash2l primarily regulates cell fate specification and neuron commitment. Furthermore, we identified Onecut2, a major downstream target of ASH2L characterized by bivalent histone modifications, and demonstrated that constitutive expression of Onecut2 restores defective proliferation and differentiation of NSPCs in adult Ash2l-deficient mice. Importantly, we identified that Onecut2 modulates TGF-\u03b2 signaling in NSPCs and that treatment with a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor rectifies the phenotype of Ash2l-deficient NSPCs. Collectively, our findings reveal the ASH2L-Onecut2-TGF-\u03b2 signaling axis that mediates postnatal neurogenesis to maintain proper forebrain function.",

        "Abstract": "In a recent study, two-dimensional Dirac phonons that are protected by nonsymmorphic symmetries in spinless systems were systematically investigated. However, the focus of this study was on the classification of Dirac phonons. To address the gap in the research on the topological features of 2D Dirac phonons based on their effective models, we classified the 2D Dirac phonons into two classes: without or with inversion symmetry, thereby clarifying the minimal symmetry requirements for enforcing 2D Dirac points. Based on symmetry analysis, we discovered that screw symmetries, together with time-reversal symmetry, play an essential role in the existence of Dirac points. To validate this result, we constructed the k\u00b7p model to describe the Dirac phonons and discussed their topological features accordingly. We found that a 2D Dirac point could be considered as a composition of two 2D Weyl points with opposite chirality. Furthermore, we provided two concrete materials to demonstrate our findings. Overall, our work provides a more detailed study of 2D Dirac points in spinless systems and clarifies their topological features.",

        "Abstract": "Determination of antipsychotics from biological samples is meaningful in the field of clinical and forensic medicine. Compared to blood, keratinized matrices such as hair and nails have attracted increasing attention in drug analysis for wider detection window. Nevertheless, the distribution and stability of antipsychotics in keratinized matrices are not clarified yet. Therefore, we developed a LC-MS/MS based method for simultaneous determination of 10 antipsychotics from blood, hair and nails, with high recovery (78.1-107.4%, 71.3-93.5% and 75.2-90.5%), low LOD (5-10\u00a0pg/mL, 5-10\u00a0pg/mg and 5\u00a0pg/mg) and high accuracy (96.0%-101.6%, 97.5%-102.5% and 97.6-101.7%). The method was applied to sets of blood, hair, and nail samples of 54 patients who received long-term therapy, and significant correlations between drug concentrations in blood and hair was found, while the correlation between nails and other matrices varied depending on the drug. Except for olanzapine, the concentrations of antipsychotics in segmental hair samples were consistent with drug exposure. Besides, the hair and nail samples of suspects in two forensic cases were analyzed and provided supporting evidence for the suspects' psychiatric state. Our research offered a deeper understanding of keratinized matrix as stable and retrospective bio-samples for antipsychotics detection in forensic practice.",

        "Abstract": "Amyloid fibril is an important pharmaceutical target for diagnostic and therapeutic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, rational design of chemical compounds that interact with amyloid fibrils is unachievable due to the lack of mechanistic understanding of the ligand-fibril interaction. Here we used cryoelectron microscopy to survey the amyloid fibril-binding mechanism of a series of compounds including classic dyes, (pre)clinical imaging tracers and newly identified binders from high-throughput screening. We obtained clear densities of several compounds in complex with an \u03b1-synuclein fibril. These structures unveil the basic mechanism of the ligand-fibril interaction, which exhibits remarkable difference from the canonical ligand-protein interaction. In addition, we discovered a druggable pocket that is also conserved in the ex vivo \u03b1-synuclein fibrils from multiple system atrophy. Collectively, these findings expand our knowledge of protein-ligand interaction in the amyloid fibril state, which will enable rational design of amyloid binders in a medicinally beneficial way.",

        "Abstract": "The quasi-static temperature and dynamic acoustic signals based on ultra-weak chirped fiber Bragg grating (CFBG) array is proposed and experimentally demonstrated, which can be employed to detect distributed acoustic and temperature signals simultaneously. Distributed temperature sensing (DTS) was realized by cross-correlation operation to measure the spectral drift of each CFBG, and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) was achieved by gauging the phase difference between adjacent CFBG. Using CFBG as the sensor unit can protect acoustic signals from the fluctuations and drifts induced by temperature change without deterioration of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Applying least square mean adaptive filter (AF) can enhance harmonic frequency suppression ratio and increase the SNR of system. In the proof-of-concept experiment the SNR of acoustic signal is higher than 100\u2005dB after the digital filter and frequency response is from 2\u2005Hz to 1.25 kHz with repetition frequency of laser pulses of 10 kHz. Temperature measurement from 30\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C is achieved with demodulation accuracy of \u00b10.8\u00b0C. The spatial resolution (SR) of two-parameter sensing is 5 m.",

        "Title": "Inhibition of DHCR24 activates LXR\u03b1 to ameliorate hepatic steatosis and inflammation.",
        "Abstract": "Liver X receptor (LXR) agonism has theoretical potential for treating NAFLD/NASH, but synthetic agonists induce hyperlipidemia in preclinical models. Desmosterol, which is converted by \u039424-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) into cholesterol, is a potent endogenous LXR agonist with anti-inflammatory properties. We aimed to investigate the effects of DHCR24 inhibition on NAFLD/NASH development. Here, by using APOE*3-Leiden. CETP mice, a well-established translational model that develops diet-induced human-like NAFLD/NASH characteristics, we report that SH42, a published DHCR24 inhibitor, markedly increases desmosterol levels in liver and plasma, reduces hepatic lipid content and the steatosis score, and decreases plasma fatty acid and cholesteryl ester concentrations. Flow cytometry showed that SH42 decreases liver inflammation by preventing Kupffer cell activation and monocyte infiltration. LXR\u03b1 deficiency completely abolishes these beneficial effects of SH42. Together, the inhibition of DHCR24 by SH42 prevents diet-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation in a strictly LXR\u03b1-dependent manner without causing hyperlipidemia. Finally, we also showed that SH42 treatment decreased liver collagen content and plasma alanine transaminase levels in an established NAFLD model. In conclusion, we anticipate that pharmacological DHCR24 inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of NAFLD/NASH.",

        "Abstract": "Participant recruitment continues to be a challenge to the success of randomized controlled trials, resulting in increased costs, extended trial timelines and delayed treatment availability. Literature provides evidence that study design features (e.g., trial phase, study site involvement) and trial sponsor are significantly associated with recruitment success. Principal investigators oversee the conduct of clinical trials, including recruitment. Through a cross-sectional survey and a thematic analysis of free-text responses, we assessed the perceptions of sixteen principal investigators regarding success factors for participant recruitment. Study site involvement and funding source do not necessarily make recruitment easier or more challenging from the perspective of the principal investigators. The most commonly used recruitment strategies are also the most effort inefficient (e.g., in-person recruitment, reviewing the electronic medical records for prescreening). Finally, we recommended actionable steps, such as improving staff support and leveraging informatics-driven approaches, to allow clinical researchers to enhance participant recruitment.",

        "Abstract": "Fluorides have been identified as a key ingredient in interphases supporting aggressive battery chemistries. While the precursor for these fluorides must be pre-stored in electrolyte components and only delivered at extreme potentials, the chemical source of fluorine so far has been confined to either negatively-charge anions or fluorinated molecules, whose presence in the inner-Helmholtz layer of electrodes, and consequently their contribution to the interphasial chemistry, is restricted. To pre-store fluorine source on positive-charged species, here we show a cation that carries fluorine in its structure is synthesized and its contribution to interphasial chemistry is explored for the very first time. An electrolyte carrying fluorine in both cation and anion brings unprecedented interphasial chemistries that translate into superior battery performance of a lithium-metal battery, including high Coulombic efficiency of up to 99.98%, and Li",

        "Abstract": "Amyloid fibrillar assemblies, originally identified as pathological entities in neurodegenerative diseases, have been widely adopted by various proteins to fulfill diverse biological functions in living organisms. Due to their unique features, such as hierarchical assembly, exceptional mechanical properties, environmental stability, and self-healing properties, amyloid fibrillar assemblies have been employed as functional materials in numerous applications. Recently, with the rapid advancement in synthetic biology and structural biology tools, new trends in the functional design of amyloid fibrillar assemblies have begun to emerge. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the design principles for functional amyloid fibrillar assemblies from an engineering perspective, as well as through the lens of structural insights. Initially, we introduce the fundamental structural configurations of amyloid assemblies and highlight the functions of representative examples. We then focus on the underlying design principles of two prevalent strategies for the design of functional amyloid fibrillar assemblies: (1) introducing new functions ",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown that AMPK plays an important role in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by participating in apoptosis, but the exact mechanism and target of action remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the protective mechanism of AMPK activation on brain injury secondary to cardiac arrest. HE, Nills and TUNEL assays were used to evaluate neuronal damage and apoptosis. The relationships between AMPK, HNF4\u03b1 and apoptotic genes were verified by ChIP-seq, dual-luciferase and WB assays. The results showed that AMPK improved the 7-day memory function of rats, and reduced neuronal cell injury and apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region after ROSC, while the use of HNF4\u03b1 inhibitor weakened the protective effect of AMPK. Further research found that AMPK positively regulated the expression of HNF4\u03b1, and AMPK could promote the expression of Bcl-2 and inhibit the expression of Bax and Cleaved-Caspase 3. In vitro experiments showed that AMPK ameliorated neuronal injury by inhibiting apoptosis through the activation of HNF4\u03b1. Combined with ChIP-seq, JASPAR analysis and Dual-luciferase assay, the binding site of HNF4\u03b1 to the upstream promoter of Bcl-2 was found. Taken together, AMPK attenuates brain injury after CA by activating HNF4\u03b1 to target Bcl-2 to inhibit apoptosis.",

        "Abstract": "The morbidity and mortality of invasive fungal infections are rising gradually. In recent years, fungi have quietly evolved stronger defense capabilities and increased resistance to antibiotics, posing huge challenges to maintaining physical health. Therefore, developing new drugs and strategies to combat these invasive fungi is crucial. There are a large number of microorganisms in the intestinal tract of mammals, collectively referred to as intestinal microbiota. At the same time, these native microorganisms co-evolve with their hosts in symbiotic relationship. Recent researches have shown that some probiotics and intestinal symbiotic bacteria can inhibit the invasion and colonization of fungi. In this paper, we review the mechanism of some intestinal bacteria affecting the growth and invasion of fungi by targeting the virulence factors, quorum sensing system, secreting active metabolites or regulating the host anti-fungal immune response, so as to provide new strategies for resisting invasive fungal infection.",

        "Title": "Rhein protects retinal M\u00fcller cells from high glucose-induced injury via activating the AMPK/Sirt1/PGC-1\u03b1 pathway.",
        "Abstract": "Oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis are important pathogenic factors of diabetic retinopathy (DR). In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the potential role of Rhein, a natural anthraquinone compound found in rhubarb, in high glucose (HG)-induced M\u00fcller cells (MIO-M1). Cell Counting Kit\u20118 assay, TUNEL assay, Western blot analysis, Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and ELISA were conducted to assess the effects of Rhein on M\u00fcller cells. Additionally, the EX-527, an Sirt1 inhibitor, was used to study whether the effects of Rhein, on HG-induced M\u00fcller cells were mediated by activation of the Sirt1 signaling pathway. Our data showed that Rhein improved cell viability of HG-induced M\u00fcller cells. Rhein reduced the ROS and MDA production and increased the activities of SOD and CAT in M\u00fcller cells in response to HG stimulation. Rhein decreased the production of VEGF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. Moreover, Rhein attenuated HG-induced apoptosis, evidenced by increase in Bcl-2 level and decreases in the Bax, caspase-3 expression. It was also found that EX-527 counteracted Rhein-mediated anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptosis effects on M\u00fcller cells. The protein levels of p-AMPK and PGC-1\u03b1 were also upregulated by Rhein. In conclusion, these findings support that Rhein may ameliorate HG-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and protect against mitochondrial dysfunction by the activation of the AMPK/Sirt1/PGC-1\u03b1 signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Catalase (CAT) is often phosphorylated and activated by protein kinases to maintain hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) homeostasis and protect cells against stresses, but whether and how CAT is switched off by protein phosphatases remains inconclusive. Here, we identified a manganese (Mn2+)-dependent protein phosphatase, which we named PHOSPHATASE OF CATALASE 1 (PC1), from rice (Oryza sativa L.) that negatively regulates salt and oxidative stress tolerance. PC1 specifically dephosphorylates CatC at Ser-9 to inhibit its tetramerization and thus activity in the peroxisome. PC1 overexpressing lines exhibited hypersensitivity to salt and oxidative stresses with a lower phospho-serine level of CATs. Phosphatase activity and seminal root growth assays indicated that PC1 promotes growth and plays a vital role during the transition from salt stress to normal growth conditions. Our findings demonstrate that PC1 acts as a molecular switch to dephosphorylate and deactivate CatC and negatively regulate H2O2 homeostasis and salt tolerance in rice. Moreover, knockout of PC1 not only improved H2O2-scavenging capacity and salt tolerance but also limited rice grain yield loss under salt stress conditions. Together, these results shed light on the mechanisms that switch off CAT and provide a strategy for breeding highly salt-tolerant rice.",

        "Abstract": "Although the ecological importance of soil viruses is increasingly recognized, how soil viruses regulate the diversity, structure and succession of microbial communities has not been well understood. Here, we conducted an incubation experiment by mixing soil viruses and bacteria in different ratios, and tracked the changes in viral and bacterial cell abundances as well as bacterial community composition. Our results revealed that viral predation predominantly targeted host lineages that are r-strategists and was a key regulator of the succession of bacterial communities. Viral lysis markedly enhanced production of insoluble particulate organic matter, hence potentially contributing to carbon sequestration. In addition, treatment with mitomycin C led to significant shift in virus to bacteria ratio, and revealed bacterial lineages sensitive to lysogenic-lytic conversion, e.g., Burkholderiaceae in particular, indicating effect of prophage induction on bacterial community succession. Soil viruses also promoted homogeneous selection of the bacterial communities, suggesting the role of viruses in influencing bacterial community assembly mechanisms. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence of the top-down control exerted by viruses on soil bacterial communities and expanded knowledge about the associated regulatory mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally with limited effective treatment options. Although the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been attempted in clinical trials to treat PDAC, the results are not promising. Therefore, in this study, we explored the application of a novel combination strategy with disulfiram (DSF) to enhance the treatment efficacy of PDAC as well as its underlying molecular mechanism. We compared the antitumor effects between single agents and the combination therapy by using mouse allograft tumor model and found DSF combined with chemoimmunotherapy significantly suppressed the growth of subcutaneous PDAC allograft tumor in mice and prolonged the survival of mice. To further investigate the alterations in the immune microenvironment of tumors from different treatment groups, we employed flow cytometry and RNA-seq analysis to examine the composition of tumor-infiltrating immune cells as well as the expression level of a variety of cytokines. Our results revealed that the proportion of CD8 T cells was notably elevated and that multiple cytokines were upregulated in the combination therapy group. Furthermore, qRT-PCR results indicated that DSF could upregulate the mRNA levels of IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2, which could be reversed by STING pathway inhibitor. Mechanistically, we found that DSF activated STING signaling pathway through Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP1) inhibition. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential clinical application of this novel combination strategy using DSF and chemoimmunotherapy in the treatment of patients with PDAC.",

        "Abstract": "Fibrotic diseases result in organ remodelling and dysfunctional failure and account for one-third of all deaths worldwide. There are no ideal treatments that can halt or reverse progressive organ fibrosis, moreover, organ transplantation is complicated by problems with a limited supply of donor organs and graft rejection. The development of new approaches, especially induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based therapy, is becoming a hot topic due to their ability to self-renew and differentiate into different cell types that may replace the fibrotic organs. In the past decade, studies have differentiated iPSCs into fibrosis-relevant cell types which were demonstrated to have anti-fibrotic effects that may have the potential to inform new effective precision treatments for organ-specific fibrosis. In this review, we summarize the potential of iPSC-based cellular approaches as therapeutic avenues for treating organ fibrosis, the advantages and disadvantages of iPSCs compared with other types of stem cell-based therapies, as well as the challenges and future outlook in this field.",

        "Abstract": "Despite advancements in medical research, androgenetic alopecia (AGA) remains a humankind problem that still needs to be overcome. To date, clinical practice lacks an ideal treatment for AGA. The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is evidenced to play a key role in hair regrowth, hence, modulating this signaling pathway for AGA therapy appears to be rational. One of the major inhibitors of the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1). In this report, we have selected a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting DKK1 in\u00a0vitro via qPCR and then tested its efficacy in\u00a0vivo on the depilated dorsal skin of the mice. The changes in hair growth in different groups were observed over time. Moreover, the visual observation of the hair growth and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining showed that DKK1-targeting siRNA reveals non-inferior results compared with the mice treated with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, commercially available minoxidil (5%) topical solution that was used as a positive control. Both- positive control and DKK1-targeting siRNA groups demonstrated significantly superior results compared with the control group that received negative control siRNA. Consequently, siRNAs targeting DKK1 may promote hair growth regulation in the AGA population via potentially activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Notwithstanding the presence of a smallpox vaccine that is effective against monkeypox (mpox), developing a universal vaccine candidate against monkeypox virus (MPXV) is highly required as the mpox multi-country outbreak has increased global concern. MPXV, along with variola virus (VARV) and vaccinia virus (VACV), belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus. Due to the genetic similarity of antigens in this study, we have designed a potentially universal mRNA vaccine based on conserved epitopes that are specific to these three viruses. In order to design a potentially universal mRNA vaccine, antigens A29, A30, A35, B6, and M1 were selected. The conserved sequences among the three viral species-MPXV, VACV, and VARV-were detected, and B and T cell epitopes containing the conserved elements were used for the design of the multi-epitope mRNA construct. Immunoinformatics analyses demonstrated the stability of the vaccine construct and optimal binding to MHC molecules. Humoral and cellular immune responses were induced by immune simulation analyses. Eventually, based on in silico analysis, the universal mRNA multi-epitope vaccine candidate designed in this study may have a potential protection against MPXV, VARV, and VACV that will contribute to the advancement of prevention strategies for unpredictable pandemics.",

        "Abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a leading cause of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The multidrug-resistance (MDR) rate of PA is increasing making the management of PA a global challenge. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines represent the most promising alternative to conventional vaccines and are widely studied for viral infection and cancer immunotherapy while rarely studied for bacterial infections. In this study, two mRNA vaccines encoding PcrV- the key component of the type III secretion system in Pseudomonas and the fusion protein OprF-I comprising outer membrane proteins OprF and OprI were constructed. The mice were immunized with either one of these mRNA vaccines or with the combination of both. Additionally, mice were vaccinated with PcrV, OprF, or the combination of these two proteins. Immunization with either mRNA-PcrV or mRNA-OprF-I elicited a Th1/Th2 mixed or slighted Th1-biased immune response, conferred broad protection, and reduced bacterial burden and inflammation in burn and systemic infection models. mRNA-PcrV induced significantly stronger antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses and higher survival rate compared with the OprF-I after challenging with all the PA strains tested. The combined mRNA vaccine demonstrated the best survival rate. Moreover, the mRNA vaccines showed the superiority over protein vaccines. These results suggest that mRNA-PcrV as well as the mixture of mRNA-PcrV and mRNA-OprF-I are promising vaccine candidates for the prevention of PA infection.",

        "Abstract": "Protein liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) plays a crucial role in mediating dynamic assembly of different membraneless organelles such as stress granules (SGs). Dysregulation of dynamic protein LLPS leads to aberrant phase transition and amyloid aggregation which is closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we found that three types of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) exhibit potent activity in preventing SG formation and promoting SG disassembly. We next demonstrate that GQDs can directly interact with the SGs-containing protein fused in sarcoma (FUS), inhibit and reverse FUS LLPS, and prevent its abnormal phase transition. Moreover, GQDs display superior activity in preventing amyloid aggregation of FUS and disaggregating preformed FUS fibrils. Mechanistic study further demonstrates that GQDs with different edge-site exhibit distinct binding affinity to FUS monomers and fibrils, which accounts for their distinct activities in modulating FUS LLPS and fibrillation. Our work reveals the potent capability of GQDs in modulating SG assembly, protein LLPS, and fibrillation and sheds light on rational design of GQDs as effective modulators of protein LLPS for therapeutics application.",

        "Abstract": "Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a critical transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in cellular adaptation to low oxygen levels. Aberrant regulation of the HIF-1 signaling pathway is linked to various human diseases. Previous studies have established that HIF-1\u03b1 is rapidly degraded in a von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL)-dependent manner under normoxic conditions. In this study, we find that pVHL binding protein 1 (VBP1) is a negative regulator of HIF-1\u03b1 but not HIF-2\u03b1 using zebrafish as an in\u00a0vivo model and in\u00a0vitro cell culture models. Deletion of vbp1 in zebrafish caused Hif-1\u03b1 accumulation and upregulation of Hif target genes. Moreover, vbp1 was involved in the induction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) under hypoxic conditions. However, VBP1 interacted with and promoted the degradation of HIF-1\u03b1 in a pVHL-independent manner. Mechanistically, we identify the ubiquitin ligase CHIP and HSP70 as new VBP1 binding partners and demonstrate that VBP1 negatively regulated CHIP and facilitated CHIP-mediated degradation of HIF-1\u03b1. In patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), lower VBP1 expression was associated with worse survival outcomes. In conclusion, our results link VBP1 with CHIP stability and provide insights into underlying molecular mechanisms of HIF-1\u03b1-driven pathological processes.",

The prepared MLM has good active and passive deformability. Under the action of the magnetic field, controllable transport, splitting, merging, and rotation are realized. In addition, controllable electric field manipulation in alkaline and acidic electrolytes is realized. This simple preparation method can be applied to the precise and rapid control of the magnetic field and electric field at the same time. Compared with other droplet manipulation methods, we realized droplet manipulation independent of special surfaces. It has the advantages of easy implementation, low cost, and high controllability. It shows great application potential in the fields of biochemical analysis, microfluidics, drug transportation in complex limited space, and intelligent soft robots.",

As a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase, silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1) is a multipotent molecule involved in many pathophysiological processes. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that Sirt1 activation may exert positive effects on SAHs by regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis. Thus, Sirt1 agonists may serve as potential therapeutic drugs for SAHs. In this review, we summarized the current state of our knowledge on the relationship between Sirt1 and SAHs and provided an updated overview of the downstream molecules of Sirt1 in SAHs.",

        "Abstract": "With the burgeoning development of computational phenotypes, it is increasingly difficult to identify the right phenotype for the right tasks. This study uses a mixed-methods approach to develop and evaluate a novel metadata framework for retrieval of and reusing computational phenotypes. Twenty active phenotyping researchers from 2 large research networks, Electronic Medical Records and Genomics and Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, were recruited to suggest metadata elements. Once consensus was reached on 39 metadata elements, 47 new researchers were surveyed to evaluate the utility of the metadata framework. The survey consisted of 5-Likert multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. Two more researchers were asked to use the metadata framework to annotate 8 type-2 diabetes mellitus phenotypes. More than 90% of the survey respondents rated metadata elements regarding phenotype definition and validation methods and metrics positively with a score of 4 or 5. Both researchers completed annotation of each phenotype within 60\u2009min. Our thematic analysis of the narrative feedback indicates that the metadata framework was effective in capturing rich and explicit descriptions and enabling the search for phenotypes, compliance with data standards, and comprehensive validation metrics. Current limitations were its complexity for data collection and the entailed human costs.",

        "Abstract": "Protein O-glycosylation is widely identified in various proteins involved in diverse biological processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that O-glycosylation plays crucial and multifaceted roles in modulating protein amyloid aggregation and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) under physiological conditions. Dysregulation of these processes is closely associated with human diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and cancers. In this review, we first summarize the distinct roles of O-glycosylation in regulating pathological aggregation of different amyloid proteins related to NDs and elaborate the underlying mechanisms of how O-glycosylation modulates protein aggregation kinetics, induces new aggregated structures, and mediates the pathogenesis of amyloid aggregates under diseased conditions. Furthermore, we introduce recent discoveries on O-GlcNAc-mediated regulation of synaptic LLPS and phase separation potency of low-complexity domain-enriched proteins. Finally, we identify challenges in future research and highlight the potential for developing new therapeutic strategies of NDs by targeting protein O-glycosylation.",

        "Abstract": "Cytochrome P450s (CYPs), as one of the most diverse enzyme superfamilies in nature, play critical functions in antioxidant reactions against endogenous and exogenous compounds. In this study, we performed genome-wide characterization of CYP superfamily members and analyzed their expression patterns under several abiotic stresses in spotted sea bass, which is known as an economically important fish species in the Chinese aquaculture industry. A total of 55 CYP genes were identified and divided into 17 families within 10 clans. The analysis of phylogeny, gene structure, and syntenic relationships provided evidence for the evolution of CYP genes and confirmed their annotation and orthology. The expression of CYP genes was examined in the liver during trichlorfon stress using quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that 20 tested CYP genes displayed significant mRNA expression changes, indicating that they may play crucial roles in the metabolism of trichlorfon and can be potential biomarkers for trichlorfon pollution. Moreover, by screening transcriptomic databases, 10, 3 and 19 CYP genes exhibited differential expression patterns in response to hypoxia, alkalinity and heat stress, respectively. Taken together, this study provided insights into the regulation of CYP genes by toxicological and environmental stresses, laid basis for extensive functional studies of the CYP superfamily in spotted sea bass and other teleost species.",

        "Abstract": "Paraquat (PQ) is the most widely used herbicide in agriculture worldwide and has been considered a high-risk environmental factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Chronic PQ exposure selectively induces dopaminergic neuron loss, the hallmark pathologic feature of PD, resulting in Parkinson-like movement disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that repetitive PQ exposure caused dopaminergic neuron loss, dopamine deficiency and motor deficits dose-dependently in mice. Accordingly, mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) was highly expressed in PQ-exposed mice and neuronal cells. Importantly, MCU knockout (KO) effectively rescued PQ-induced dopaminergic neuron loss and motor deficits in mice. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of MCU alleviated PQ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death in vitro. Mechanistically, PQ exposure triggered mitochondrial fragmentation via imbalance of the optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) processing manifested by cleavage of L-OPA1 to S-OPA1, which was reversed by inhibition of MCU. Notably, the upregulation of MCU was mediated by miR-129-1-3p posttranscriptionally, and overexpression of miR-129-1-3p could rebalance OPA1 processing and attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death induced by PQ exposure. Consequently, our work uncovers an essential role of MCU and a novel molecular mechanism, miR-MCU-OPA1, in PQ-induced pathogenesis of PD, providing a potential target and strategy for environmental neurotoxins-induced PD treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Cardiac hemangioma is a very rare benign tumor of the heart which accounts for 1-2% of all primary cardiac tumors. Multiple cardiac hemangiomas are even rarer with only three cases published in the literature. Pathologically it can be divided into cavernous hemangioma, capillary hemangioma, arteriovenous hemangioma, mixed-type hemangioma, and so on. At present, the etiology of cardiac hemangioma is not completely clear. In this study, we present multiple cardiac hemangiomas located in the right atrium and discuss the new unreported possible cause (rheumatism) of cardiac hemangioma. This is the fourth case of multiple cardiac hemangiomas in the medical literature and the first time to present rheumatism as the cause of cardiac hemangioma.",

        "Abstract": "Spatiotemporally controllable droplet manipulation is essential in diverse applications, ranging from thermal management to microfluidics and water harvesting. Despite considerable advances, droplet manipulation without surface or droplet pretreatment is still challenging in terms of response and functional adaptability. Here, a droplet ultrasonic tweezer (DUT) based on phased array is proposed for versatile droplet manipulation. The DUT can generate a twin trap ultrasonic field at the focal point for trapping and maneuvering the droplet by changing the position of the focal point, which enables a highly flexible and precise programmable control. By leveraging the acoustic radiation force resulting from the twin trap, the droplet can pass through a confined slit 2.5 times smaller than its own size, cross a slope with an inclination up to 80\u00b0, and even reciprocate in the vertical direction. These findings provide a satisfactory paradigm for robust contactless droplet manipulation in various practical settings including droplet ballistic ejection, droplet dispensing, and surface cleaning.",

        "Title": "Robust Janus Superwetting Textile with Large Pore Sizes for Oil-in-Water Emulsion Separation.",
        "Abstract": "Developing advanced oil-water separation technology is significant for environmental conservation. According to the synergetic effects of the size-sieving mechanism, superwetting materials with small pore sizes have been designed to realize high-efficiency separation for oil-water emulsions. However, the separation flux limited by the pore size and the weakness of the superwetting material impede its practical application severely. Herein, we construct a robust Janus superwetting textile with large pore sizes for oil-in-water emulsion separation. The pristine textile is coated by the as-prepared CuO nanoparticles as the bottom layer with superhydrophilicity and then grafted by 1-octadecanethiol as the top layer with superhydrophobicity to construct the Janus textile. When used as a filter, the superhydrophobic layer acts as the nucleation site to coalesce the small oil droplets facilely. Then, the coalesced oil fills the pores of the superhydrophobic layer and selectively permeates it but is blocked by the superhydrophilic layer with large pore sizes. Utilizing the unique separation mechanism, the Janus textile realizes efficient and rapid separation. Even after multicycle separation, hot liquid immersion for 24 h, tribological test for 60 min, and sandpaper abrasion for 500 cycles, the Janus textile still retains the superwettability and excellent separation performance, manifesting outstanding stability to resist severe damage. This separation strategy provides a novel guideline for high-efficiency and high-flux emulsion separation and practical application.",

        "Title": "Extreme-Low-Speed Heavy Load Bearing Fault Diagnosis by Using Improved RepVGG and Acoustic Emission Signals.",
        "Abstract": "With the worldwide carbon neutralization boom, low-speed heavy load bearings have been widely used in the field of wind power. Bearing failure generates impulses when the rolling element passes the cracked surface of the bearing. Over the past decade, acoustic emission (AE) techniques have been used to detect failure signals. However, the high sampling rates of AE signals make it difficult to design and extract fault features; thus, deep neural network-based approaches have been proposed. In this paper, we proposed an improved RepVGG bearing fault diagnosis technique. The normalized and noise-reduced bearing signals were first converted into Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs) and then inputted into the model. In addition, the exponential moving average method was used to optimize the model and improve its accuracy. Data were extracted from the test bench and wind turbine main shaft bearing. Four damage classes were studied experimentally. The experimental results demonstrated that the improved RepVGG model could be employed for classifying low-speed heavy load bearing states by using MFCCs. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed model was assessed by performing comparisons with existing models.",

        "Abstract": "Much progress has been made toward generating analogs of early embryos, such as gastruloids and embryoids, in\u00a0vitro. However, methods for how to fully mimic the cell movements of gastrulation and coordinate germ-layer patterning to induce head formation are still lacking. Here, we show that a regional Nodal gradient applied to zebrafish animal pole explant can generate a structure that recapitulates the key cell movements of gastrulation. Using single-cell transcriptome and in situ hybridization analysis, we assess the dynamics of the cell fates and patterning of this structure. The mesendoderm differentiates into the anterior endoderm, prechordal plate, notochord, and tailbud-like cells along an anterior-posterior axis, and an anterior-posterior-patterned head-like structure (HLS) progressively forms during late gastrulation. Among 105 immediate Nodal targets, 14 genes contain axis-induction ability, and 5 of them induce a complete or partial head structure when overexpressed in the ventral side of zebrafish embryos.",

        "Title": "Target-driven machine learning-enabled virtual screening (TAME-VS) platform for early-stage hit identification.",
        "Abstract": "High-throughput screening (HTS) methods enable the empirical evaluation of a large scale of compounds and can be augmented by virtual screening (VS) techniques to save time and money by using potential active compounds for experimental testing. Structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening approaches have been extensively studied and applied in drug discovery practice with proven outcomes in advancing candidate molecules. However, the experimental data required for VS are expensive, and hit identification in an effective and efficient manner is particularly challenging during early-stage drug discovery for novel protein targets. Herein, we present our TArget-driven Machine learning-Enabled VS (TAME-VS) platform, which leverages existing chemical databases of bioactive molecules to modularly facilitate hit finding. Our methodology enables bespoke hit identification campaigns through a user-defined protein target. The input target ID is used to perform a homology-based target expansion, followed by compound retrieval from a large compilation of molecules with experimentally validated activity. Compounds are subsequently vectorized and adopted for machine learning (ML) model training. These machine learning models are deployed to perform model-based inferential virtual screening, and compounds are nominated based on predicted activity. Our platform was retrospectively validated across ten diverse protein targets and demonstrated clear predictive power. The implemented methodology provides a flexible and efficient approach that is accessible to a wide range of users. The TAME-VS platform is publicly available at https://github.com/bymgood/Target-driven-ML-enabled-VS to facilitate early-stage hit identification.",

        "Abstract": "The effective protection and utilization of poultry resources depend on an accurate understanding of the genetic diversity and population structure. The breeding of the specialized poultry lineage \"Yufen 1\", with its defined characteristics, was approved by the China Poultry Genetic Resource Committee in 2015. Thus, to investigate the relationship between the progenitor H line and other poultry breeds, the genetic diversity and population structure of \"Yufen 1\" H line (YF) were investigated and compared with those of 2 commercial chicken breeds, the ancestor breed Red Jungle Fowls, and 11 Chinese indigenous chicken breeds based on a whole-genome resequencing approach using 8,112,424 SNPs. The genetic diversity of YF was low, and the rate of linkage disequilibrium decay was significantly slower than that of the other Chinese indigenous breeds. In addition, it was shown that the YF population was strongly selected during intensive breeding and that genetic resources have been seriously threatened, which highlights the need to establish a systematic conservation strategy as well as utilization techniques to maintain genetic diversity within YF. Moreover, a principal component analysis, a neighbor-joining tree analysis, a structure analysis, and genetic differentiation indices indicated that YF harbors a distinctive genetic resource with a unique genetic structure separate from that of Chinese indigenous breeds at the genome level. The findings provide a valuable resource and the theoretical basis for the further conservation and utilization of YF.",

        "Abstract": "Few studies have examined the link between short-term exposure to air pollutants and atrial fibrillation (AF) episodes. This study aims to examine the association of hourly criteria air pollutants with AF episodes. We employ a smart device-based photoplethysmography technology to screen AF from 2018 to 2021. Hourly concentrations of six criteria air pollutants are matched to the onset hour of AF for each participant. We adopt a time-stratified case-crossover design to capture the acute effects of air pollutants on AF episodes, using conditional logistic regression models. Subgroup analyses are conducted by age, gender, and season. A total of 11,906 episodes of AF are identified in 2976 participants from 288 Chinese cities. Generally, the strongest associations of air pollutants are present at lag 18-24\u2009h, with positive and linear exposure-response relationships. For an interquartile range increase in inhalable particles, fine particles, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide, the odds ratio (OR) of AF is 1.19 [95% confidential interval (CI): 1.03, 1.37], 1.38 (95%CI: 1.14, 1.67), 1.60 (95%CI: 1.16, 2.20) and 1.48 (95%CI: 1.19, 1.84), respectively. The estimates are robust to the adjustment of co-pollutants, and they are larger in females, older people, and in cold seasons. There are insignificant associations for sulfur dioxide and ozone. This nationwide case-crossover study demonstrates robust evidence of significant associations between hourly exposure to air pollutants and the onset of AF episodes, which underscores the importance of ongoing efforts to further improve air quality as an effective target for AF prevention.",

        "Abstract": "Besides entrapping sister chromatids, cohesin drives other high-order chromosomal structural dynamics like looping, compartmentalization and condensation. ESCO2 acetylates a subset of cohesin so that cohesion must be established and only be established between nascent sister chromatids. How this process is precisely achieved remains unknown. Here, we report that GSK3 family kinases provide higher hierarchical control through an ESCO2 regulator, CRL4MMS22L. GSK3s phosphorylate Thr105 in MMS22L, resulting in homo-dimerization of CRL4MMS22L and ESCO2 during S phase as evidenced by single-molecule spectroscopy and several biochemical approaches. A single phospho-mimicking mutation on MMS22L (T105D) is sufficient to mediate their dimerization and rescue the cohesion defects caused by GSK3 or MMS22L depletion, whereas non-phosphorylable T105A exerts dominant-negative effects even in wildtype cells. Through cell fractionation and time-course measurements, we show that GSK3s facilitate the timely chromatin association of MMS22L and ESCO2 and subsequently SMC3 acetylation. The necessity of ESCO2 dimerization implicates symmetric control of cohesion establishment in eukaryotes.",

        "Abstract": "Microglia are the primary source of transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) in the brain; however, the roles of microglial TGM2 in neural development and disease are still not well known. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role and mechanisms of microglial TGM2 in the brain. A mouse line with a specific knockout of Tgm2 in microglia was generated. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot and qRT-PCR assays were performed to evaluate the expression levels of TGM2, PSD-95 and CD68. Confocal imaging, immunofluorescence staining and behavioural analyses were conducted to identify phenotypes of microglial TGM2 deficiency. Finally, RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR and co-culture of neurons and microglia were used to explore the potential mechanisms. Deletion of microglial Tgm2 causes impaired synaptic pruning, reduced anxiety and increased cognitive deficits in mice. At the molecular level, the phagocytic genes, such as Cq1a, C1qb and Tim4, are significantly down-regulated in TGM2-deficient microglia. This study elucidates a novel role of microglial TGM2 in regulating synaptic remodelling and cognitive function, indicating that microglia Tgm2 is essential for proper neural development.",

The research is conceptual and uses the methods of a literature review and logical analysis. Sports moral character is shown to have the characteristics of practicality, growth, and integration. It is a stable moral quality that is gradually formed and displayed in sports practice under the influence of family, school, and social environments. Sports moral character differs in some ways from other related concepts. Sports morality is the objective existence of \"reason,\" to which sports character and sportsmanship are both more applicable than is sports moral character.",

Ionizable cationic lipids are the most important component in LNPs. Herein, we developed a series of new ionizable lipids featuring bioreducible disulfide bonds, and constructed a library of lipids derived from dimercaprol. LNPs prepared from these ionizable lipids could be stored at 4 \u00b0C for a long term and are non-toxic toward HepG2 and 293T cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the best C4S18A formulations, which embody linoleoyl tails, show strong firefly luciferase (Fluc) mRNA expression in the liver and spleen via intravenous (IV) injection, or at the local injection site via intramuscular injection (IM). The newly designed ionizable lipids can be potentially safe and high-efficiency nanomaterials for mRNA therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Traumatic brain injury usually results in neuronal loss and cognitive deficits. Promoting endogenous neurogenesis has been considered as a viable treatment option to improve functional recovery after TBI. However, neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in neurogenic regions are often unable to migrate and differentiate into mature neurons at the injury site. Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) has been identified as a crucial component of neurogenic niche, and significantly dysregulated after TBI. Therefore, we speculate that TGM2 may play an important role in neurogenesis after TBI, and strategies targeting TGM2 to promote endogenous neural regeneration may be applied in TBI therapy.

        "Title": "\u03b2 subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels in cardiovascular diseases.",
        "Abstract": "Calcium signaling is required in bodily functions essential for survival, such as muscle contractions and neuronal communications. Of note, the voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) expressed on muscle and neuronal cells, as well as some endocrine cells, are transmembrane protein complexes that allow for the selective entry of calcium ions into the cells. The \u03b11 subunit constitutes the main pore-forming subunit that opens in response to membrane depolarization, and its biophysical functions are regulated by various auxiliary subunits-\u03b2, \u03b12\u03b4, and \u03b3 subunits. Within the cardiovascular system, the \u03b3-subunit is not expressed and is therefore not discussed in this review. Because the \u03b11 subunit is the pore-forming subunit, it is a prominent druggable target and the focus of many studies investigating potential therapeutic interventions for cardiovascular diseases. While this may be true, it should be noted that the direct inhibition of the \u03b11 subunit may result in limited long-term cardiovascular benefits coupled with undesirable side effects, and that its expression and biophysical properties may depend largely on its auxiliary subunits. Indeed, the \u03b12\u03b4 subunit has been reported to be essential for the membrane trafficking and expression of the \u03b11 subunit. Furthermore, the \u03b2 subunit not only prevents proteasomal degradation of the \u03b11 subunit, but also directly modulates the biophysical properties of the \u03b11 subunit, such as its voltage-dependent activities and open probabilities. More importantly, various isoforms of the \u03b2 subunit have been found to differentially modulate the \u03b11 subunit, and post-translational modifications of the \u03b2 subunits further add to this complexity. These data suggest the possibility of the \u03b2 subunit as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases. However, emerging studies have reported the presence of cardiomyocyte membrane \u03b11 subunit trafficking and expression in a \u03b2 subunit-independent manner, which would undermine the efficacy of \u03b2 subunit-targeting drugs. Nevertheless, a better understanding of the auxiliary \u03b2 subunit would provide a more holistic approach when targeting the calcium channel complexes in treating cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, this review focuses on the post-translational modifications of the \u03b2 subunit, as well as its role as an auxiliary subunit in modulating the calcium channel complexes.",

        "Abstract": "Short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate, have multiple metabolic benefits in individuals who are lean but not in individuals with metabolic syndrome, with the underlying mechanisms still being unclear. We aimed to investigate the role of gut microbiota in the induction of metabolic benefits of dietary butyrate. We performed antibiotic-induced microbiota depletion of the gut and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice, a well-established translational model for developing human-like metabolic syndrome, and revealed that dietary butyrate reduced appetite and ameliorated high-fat diet-induced (HFD-induced) weight gain dependent on the presence of gut microbiota. FMT from butyrate-treated lean donor mice, but not butyrate-treated obese donor mice, into gut microbiota-depleted recipient mice reduced food intake, attenuated HFD-induced weight gain, and improved insulin resistance. 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing on cecal bacterial DNA of recipient mice implied that these effects were accompanied by the selective proliferation of Lachnospiraceae bacterium 28-4 in the gut as induced by butyrate. Collectively, our findings reveal a crucial role of gut microbiota in the beneficial metabolic effects of dietary butyrate as strongly associated with the abundance of Lachnospiraceae bacterium 28-4.",

In this study, we found the dwarfing rootstock 'Yunnan' quince could significantly increase the flowering rate of 'Abb\u00e9 Fetel' pear scions. The RNA-sequencing data revealed significant changes in the expression of genes related to hormone pathways. Furthermore, hormone analyses indicated that 'Yunnan' quince significantly decreased the GA",

Herein we present a first-principles study of single-atom catalysis on two-dimensional graphene and electride heterostructures. The anion electron gas in the electride layer enables a colossal electron transfer to the graphene layer, with the degree of transfer being controllable by the selection of electride. The charge transfer tunes the d-orbital electron occupancy of a single metal atom, enhancing the catalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen reduction reactions.

        "Title": "A review of TSHR- and IGF-1R-related pathogenesis and treatment of Graves' orbitopathy.",
        "Abstract": "Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease, but its pathogenesis remains unclear. There are few review articles on GO research from the perspective of target cells and target antigens. A systematic search of PubMed was performed, focusing mainly on studies published after 2015 that involve the role of target cells, orbital fibroblasts (OFs) and orbital adipocytes (OAs), target antigens, thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and their corresponding antibodies, TSHR antibodies (TRAbs) and IGF-1R antibodies (IGF-1R Abs), in GO pathogenesis and the potentially effective therapies that target TSHR and IGF-1R. Based on the results, OFs may be derived from bone marrow-derived CD34+ fibrocytes. In addition to CD34+ OFs, CD34- OFs are important in the pathogenesis of GO and may be involved in hyaluronan formation. CD34- OFs expressing Slit2 suppress the phenotype of CD34+ OFs. \u03b2-arrestin 1 can be involved in TSHR/IGF-1R crosstalk as a scaffold. Research on TRAbs has gradually shifted to TSAbs, TBAbs and the titre of TRAbs. However, the existence and role of IGF-1R Abs are still unknown and deserve further study. Basic and clinical trials of TSHR-inhibiting therapies are increasing, and TSHR is an expected therapeutic target. Teprotumumab has become the latest second-line treatment for GO. This review aims to effectively describe the pathogenesis of GO from the perspective of target cells and target antigens and provide ideas for its fundamental treatment.",

        "Abstract": "The electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network assessed the feasibility of deploying portable phenotype rule-based algorithms with natural language processing (NLP) components added to improve performance of existing algorithms using electronic health records (EHRs). Based on scientific merit and predicted difficulty, eMERGE selected six existing phenotypes to enhance with NLP. We assessed performance, portability, and ease of use. We summarized lessons learned by: (1) challenges; (2) best practices to address challenges based on existing evidence and/or eMERGE experience; and (3) opportunities for future research. Adding NLP resulted in improved, or the same, precision and/or recall for all but one algorithm. Portability, phenotyping workflow/process, and technology were major themes. With NLP, development and validation took longer. Besides portability of NLP technology and algorithm replicability, factors to ensure success include privacy protection, technical infrastructure setup, intellectual property agreement, and efficient communication. Workflow improvements can improve communication and reduce implementation time. NLP performance varied mainly due to clinical document heterogeneity; therefore, we suggest using semi-structured notes, comprehensive documentation, and customization options. NLP portability is possible with improved phenotype algorithm performance, but careful planning and architecture of the algorithms is essential to support local customizations.",

        "Abstract": "Results show that the astrocytes can not only listen to the talk of large assemble of neurons but also give advice to the conversations and are significant sources of heterogeneous couplings as well. In the present work, we focus on such regulation character of astrocytes and explore the role of heterogeneous couplings among interacted neuron-astrocyte components in a signal response. We consider reduced dynamics in which the listening and advising processes of astrocytes are mapped into the form of group coupling, where the couplings are normally distributed. In both globally coupled overdamped bistable oscillators and an excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuron model, we numerically and analytically demonstrate that two types of bell-shaped collective response curves can be obtained as the ensemble coupling strength or the heterogeneity of group coupling rise, respectively, which can be seen as a new type of double resonance. Furthermore, through the bifurcation analysis, we verify that these resonant signal responses stem from the competition between dispersion and aggregation induced by heterogeneous group and positive pairwise couplings, respectively. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the signal propagation in coupled systems with quenched disorder.",

        "Abstract": "Excessive bone resorption due to increased inflammatory factors is a common feature of inflammatory lytic bone diseases. This group of diseases is effectively treated with drugs. In recent years, many studies have reported that traditional Chinese medicine herbs have substantial effects on inflammation, osteoclast differentiation and maturation, and bone destruction. Herein, we investigated the effects of osthole (OST) on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced macrophage polarization, inflammatory responses, and osteolysis. In vitro, we used immunofluorescence and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays to confirm whether bone marrow-derived macrophages showed an increased expression of inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-6, iNOS, CCR7, and CD86, in the presence of LPS. However, we found that such expression was suppressed and that the M2 macrophage expression increased in the presence of OST. OST reduced LPS- and RANKL-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species production in the bone marrow-derived macrophages. Further, it potently suppressed osteoclast differentiation and osteoclast-specific gene expression by suppressing the P38/MAPK and NF-",

        "Abstract": "The manipulation of droplets plays a vital role in fundamental research and practical applications, from chemical reactions to bioanalysis. As an intriguing and active format, light control of droplets, typically induced by photochemistry, photomechanics, light-induced Marangoni effects or light-induced electric fields, enables remote and contactless control with remarkable spatial and temporal accuracy. However, current light control of droplets suffers from poor performance and limited reliability. Here we develop a new superamphiphobic material that integrates the dual merits of light and electric field by rationally preparing liquid metal particles/poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) polymer composites with photo-induced charge generation capability in real time, enabling light control of droplets on the basis of photo-induced dielectrophoretic force. We demonstrate that this photo-induced charged surface (PICS) imparts a new paradigm for controllable droplet motion, including high average velocity (\u223c35.9\u00a0mm s",

Although carbapenem antibiotics are considered to be the last line of defense against multidrug-resistant bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) break through them. In our study, we therefore, examined the prevalence of CRE and characteristics of antimicrobial resistance in 6 conventional broiler-fattening farms in Shandong Province, China. Our study revealed isolation rates of 3.57% (6/168) for carbapenem-resistant E. coli, 10% (5/50) for carbapenem-resistant P. mirabilis, and 3.03% (1/33) for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae.

        "Abstract": "Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) and digital image correlation (DIC) are widely applied in three-dimensional (3D) measurements. The combination of DIC and FPP can effectively overcome their respective shortcomings. However, the speckle on the surface of an object seriously affects the quality and modulation of fringe images captured by cameras, which will lead to non-negligible errors in the measurement results. In this paper, we propose a fringe image extraction method based on deep learning technology, which transforms speckle-embedded fringe images into speckle-free fringe images. The principle of the proposed method, 3D coordinate calculation, and deformation measurements are introduced. Compared with the traditional 3D-DIC method, the experimental results show that this method is effective and precise.",

        "Abstract": "This study aims to explore how pandemic-related media use relates to both protective and overprotective behaviors and to probe the underlying mechanisms. The data were collected online during the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China, and a total of 1118 valid cases, which covered the 30 provincial administrative divisions in mainland China, were collected. Results showed that official government media use was positively associated with protective behaviors and institutional trust was an important mediator. Commercial media use was also found to be positively associated with overprotective behavior, and anxiety mediated this relationship. Findings of this study suggested that different media sources could play completely different roles. Institutional trust in government institutions and medical care systems were equally critical in translating the media effect into public compliance with the preventive measures advocated by the relevant departments. Media outlets and practitioners should also be responsible in order to avoid causing unnecessary anxiety among the public so as to reduce irrational overprotective behaviors.",

        "Abstract": "Catalase (CAT) is a vital antioxidant enzyme, while phosphorylation pivotally regulates its function. Many phosphosites have been identified in CAT, but their functions remained largely elusive. We functionally studied five phosphoserines (Ser-9, -10, -11, -18, and -205) of CatC in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Phospho-Ser-9 and -\u00a011 and dephospho-Ser-18 promoted the enzymatic activity of CatC and enhanced oxidative and salt tolerance in yeast. Phosphorylation status of Ser-18 did not affect CatC peroxisomal targeting and stability, but dephospho-Ser-18 promoted CatC tetramerization to enhance its activity. Moreover, overexpression of dephospho-mimic form CatC",

        "Abstract": "Analogues of the hepatokine fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) are in clinical development for type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) treatment. Although their glucose-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects have been largely unraveled, the mechanisms by which they alleviate liver injury have only been scarcely addressed. Here, we aimed to unveil the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of FGF21 on NASH using APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice, a well-established model for human-like metabolic diseases. Liver-specific FGF21 overexpression was achieved in mice, followed by administration of a high-fat high-cholesterol diet for 23 weeks. FGF21 prevented hepatic lipotoxicity, accompanied by activation of thermogenic tissues and attenuation of adipose tissue inflammation, improvement of hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and upregulation of hepatic programs involved in fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol removal. Furthermore, FGF21 inhibited hepatic inflammation, as evidenced by reduced Kupffer cell (KC) activation, diminished monocyte infiltration, and lowered accumulation of monocyte-derived macrophages. Moreover, FGF21 decreased lipid- and scar-associated macrophages, which correlated with less hepatic fibrosis as demonstrated by reduced collagen accumulation. Collectively, hepatic FGF21 overexpression limits hepatic lipotoxicity, inflammation, and fibrogenesis. Mechanistically, FGF21 blocks hepatic lipid influx and accumulation through combined endocrine and autocrine signaling, respectively, which prevents KC activation and lowers the presence of lipid- and scar-associated macrophages to inhibit fibrogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Bavachin is a dihydroflavonoid compound isolated from Psoralea corylifolia, and exhibits anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and lipid-lowering activities. Recent attention has gradually drawn on bavachin-induced apoptosis in many human cancer cell lines. However, the anti-cancer effects and related mechanisms in colorectal cancer remain unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of bavachin on colorectal cancer in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that bavachin inhibited the proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells and induce apoptosis. These changes were mediated by activating the MAPK signaling pathway, which significantly up-regulated the expression of Gadd45a. Furthermore, Gadd45a silencing obviously attenuated bavachin-mediated cell apoptosis. Inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway by JNK/ERK/p38 inhibitors also weakened the up-regulation of Gadd45a by bavachin. The anticancer effect of bavachin was also validated using a mouse xenograft model of human colorectal cancer. In conclusion, these findings suggest that bavachin induces the apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells through activating the MAPK signaling pathway.",

Iron is the ideal element for cathode materials considering its abundance, low cost and toxicity. However, the poor reversibility of (de)lithiation and low electronic conductivity prevent iron-based high specific energy multi-valence conversion cathodes from practical applications. In this work, a sustainable FeOF nanocomposite is developed with extraordinary performance. The specific capacity and energy reach 621\u00a0mAh\u00a0g",

        "Abstract": "There is a strong association between soyfoods or soybean product consumption and adolescent health, but there are few studies on the association between soyfoods or soybean product consumption and psychological symptoms among university students. To this end, this study investigated the association between soyfoods or soybean products consumption and psychological symptoms among Chinese university students and analyzed the association between them. A three-stage stratified whole-group sampling method was used to administer questionnaires on soyfoods or soybean products consumption and psychological symptoms to 7742 university students in China. Self-assessment questionnaires were also administered to confounding variables such as basic demographic information, family status, parental education, body mass index (BMI), and moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The chi-square test, one-way ANOVA, and logistic regression analysis were used to explore the association and differences between soyfoods or soybean products consumption and psychological symptoms. The proportion of Chinese university students' soyfoods or soybean products consumption in \u2264one time/week, two-four times/week, and \u2265five times/week were 38.81%, 40.24%, and 20.95%, respectively. University students' psychological symptoms problem detection rate was 16.22%. The detection rate of psychological symptoms was lower among university male students (14.75%) than female students (17.35%), and the difference was statistically significant (\u03c7",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and the pathological accumulation of misfolded \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in the brain. A growing body of evidence suggests that the formation of misfolded \u03b1-syn and aggregation may begin in the peripheral nervous system, specifically the enteric nervous system, and then propagate to the central nervous system via the vagus nerve. However, the PD-like neuropathology induced by the intestine and vagus nerve extracts is rarely investigated. In this work, we injected lysates of the intestine and vagus obtained from a diagnosed PD patient, which contained abnormal \u03b1-syn aggregates, into the rat striatum unilaterally. Strikingly, such an injection induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration and \u03b1-syn depositions in the striatum, substantia nigra, and other brain regions, including the frontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, hypothalamus, brain stem, and cerebellum. Moreover, significant activation of microglia and the development of astrogliosis were observed in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the injected rats. These findings provide essential information for our understanding of PD pathogenesis, as we established for the first time that the \u03b1-syn aggregates in the intestine and vagus of a PD patient were sufficient to induce prion-like propagation of endogenous \u03b1-syn pathology in wild-type rats.",

        "Abstract": "Mineral elements and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pollutants in livestock and poultry farms' wastewater are often sources of ecological and public health problems. To understand the heavy-metal pollution status and the characteristics of drug-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) in swine-farm wastewater in Shandong Province and to provide guidance for the rational use of mineral-element additives, common antibiotics, and quaternary ammonium compound disinfectants on swine farms, 10 mineral elements were measured and E. coli isolated from wastewater and its resistance to 29 commonly used antibiotics and resistance genes was determined. Finally, phylogenetic and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses was performed on E. coli. The results showed serious pollution from iron and zinc, with a comprehensive pollution index of 708.94 and 3.13, respectively. It is worth noting that average iron levels in 75% (12/16) of the districts exceed allowable limits. Multidrug-resistant E. coli were found in every city of the province. The E. coli isolated from swine-farm wastewater were mainly resistant to tetracyclines (95.3%), chloramphenicol (77.8%), and sulfonamides (62.2%), while antibiotic resistance genes for quinolones, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, and \u03b2-lactams were all more than 60%. The clonal complex 10 (CC10) was prevalent, and ST10 and ST48 were dominant in E. coli isolates. Multidrug-resistant E. coli were widely distributed, with mainly A genotypes. However, the mechanism of the effect of iron on antibiotic resistance needs more study in this area. Thus, further strengthening the prevention and control of iron and zinc pollution and standardizing the use of antibiotics and mineral element additives in the swine industry are necessary.",

        "Abstract": "Cannabidivarin (CBDV), a structural analog of cannabidiol (CBD), has received attention in recent years owing to its anticonvulsant property and potential for treating autism spectrum disorder. However, the function and mechanism of CBDV involved in the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) remain unclear. In this work, we found that CBDV inhibited \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregation in an established transgenetic Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The phenolic hydroxyl groups of CBDV are critical for scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing the in vivo aggregation of \u03b1-syn and preventing DAergic neurons from 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced injury and degeneration. By combining multiple biophysical approaches, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy and fibrillation kinetics assays, we confirmed that CBDV does not directly interact with \u03b1-syn or inhibit the formation of \u03b1-syn fibrils in vitro. Further cellular signaling investigation showed that the ability of CBDV to prevent oxidative stress, the accumulation of \u03b1-syn and the degeneration of DAergic neurons was mediated by DAF-16 in the worms. This study demonstrates that CBDV alleviates the aggregation of \u03b1-syn in vivo and reveals that the phenolic hydroxyl groups of CBDV are critical for this activity, providing a potential for the development of CBDV as a drug candidate for PD therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Island systems are known to harbor disproportionate amounts of geographically restricted biodiversity and to experience high rates of species loss, and they ultimately represent critical systems with significant conservation values. However, knowledge of the biodiversity value of insular systems remains highly fragmented and incomplete for many groups of organisms, especially insects. This gap limits our understanding of their global significance for biodiversity and inhibits prioritization for future exploration and conservation efforts. Here, we developed a new database to present current knowledge on ants on 2678 islands globally, based on nominal species, and provide information on their native or exotic status. In total, this database contains 7010 ant species (44.6% of the known global ant fauna) that have been recorded on islands globally from 449,232 records. In addition, this database identifies 108 large islands (area\u2009>\u2009200\u2009km",

        "Abstract": "Invasive infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are associated with high mortality and morbidity. The sooner the pathogen is determined, the better it is beneficial to patient. However, routine laboratory inspections are time-consuming and laborious. A thorough research was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science (until June 2021) to identify studies evaluating the accuracy of MRSA identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). STATA 15.0 software was used to analyze the pooled results of sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were utilized to show the overall performance of MALDI-TOF MS. Fifteen studies involving 2471 isolates were included in this study after the final selection in this meta-analysis. Using the random effects model forest plot to summarize the overall statistics, the sensitivity of MALDI-TOF MS for identifying MRSA was 92% (95% CI: 81%-97%), and the specificity was 97% (95% CI: 89%-99%). In the SROC curve, the AUC reached 0.99 (95% CI: 97%-99%). Deeks' test showed no significant publication bias in this meta-analysis. Compared with clinical reference methods, MALDI-TOF MS identification of MRSA shows a higher degree of sensitivity and specificity.",

        "Abstract": "An automatic multi-plug filtration cleanup (m-PFC) tip-filtration method was developed to reduce the manual operation workload in sample preparation. In this work, m-PFC was based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes mixed with primary secondary amines and anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) in a packed column for analysis of pesticide residues followed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Method validation was performed on 22 pesticide residues in carrot, spinach and leek, at spiked levels of 5, 10 and 50\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, respectively. The average recoveries were between 70.1 and 119.5% with associated relative standard deviations <20% (n\u2009=\u20096) indicating satisfactory accuracy and repeatability. Matrix-matched calibration curves were performed with the correlation coefficients (R2) higher than 0.9903 within a linearity range of 5-100\u00a0ng/mL. The limits of quantification were 5\u00a0\u03bcg/kg for all the pesticides in carrot, spinach and leek matrices. The developed method was successfully used to determine pesticide residues in market samples.",

        "Title": "Quantifying factors that affect polygenic risk score performance across diverse ancestries and age groups for body mass index.",
        "Abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have led to enthusiasm for precision medicine. However, it is well documented that PRS do not generalize across groups differing in ancestry or sample characteristics e.g., age. Quantifying performance of PRS across different groups of study participants, using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from multiple ancestry groups and sample sizes, and using different linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference panels may clarify which factors are limiting PRS transferability. To evaluate these factors in the PRS generation process, we generated body mass index (BMI) PRS (PRSBMI) in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network (N=75,661). Analyses were conducted in two ancestry groups (European and African) and three age ranges (adult, teenagers, and children). For PRSBMI calculations, we evaluated five LD reference panels and three sets of GWAS summary statistics of varying sample size and ancestry. PRSBMI performance increased for both African and European ancestry individuals using cross-ancestry GWAS summary statistics compared to European-only summary statistics (6.3% and 3.7% relative R2 increase, respectively, pAfrican=0.038, pEuropean=6.26x10-4). The effects of LD reference panels were more pronounced in African ancestry study datasets. PRSBMI performance degraded in children; R2 was less than half of teenagers or adults. The effect of GWAS summary statistics sample size was small when modeled with the other factors. Additionally, the potential of using a PRS generated for one trait to predict risk for comorbid diseases is not well understood especially in the context of cross-ancestry analyses - we explored clinical comorbidities from the electronic health record associated with PRSBMI and identified significant associations with type 2 diabetes and coronary atherosclerosis. In summary, this study quantifies the effects that ancestry, GWAS summary statistic sample size, and LD reference panel have on PRS performance, especially in cross-ancestry and age-specific analyses.",

        "Title": "Designing multi-epitope mRNA construct as a universal influenza vaccine candidate for future epidemic/pandemic preparedness.",
        "Abstract": "Despite the availability of prevention and treatment strategies and advancing immunization approaches, the influenza virus remains a global threat that continues to plague humanity with unpredictable pandemics. Due to the unusual genetic variability and segmented genome, the reassortment between different strains of influenza is facilitated and the viruses continuously evolve and adapt to the host cell's immunity. This underlies the seasonal vaccine mismatches that decrease the vaccine efficacy and increase the risk of outbreaks. Thus, the development of a universal vaccine covering all the influenza A and B strains would reduce the pervasiveness of the influenza virus. In the current study, a potentially universal influenza multi-epitope vaccine was designed based on the experimentally tested conserved T cell and B cell epitopes of hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), nucleoprotein (NP), and matrix-2 proton channel (M2) of the virus. The immune simulation and molecular docking of the vaccine construct with TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 elicited the favorable immunogenicity of the vaccine and the formation of stable complexes, respectively. Ultimately, based on the immunoinformatics analysis, the universal mRNA multi-epitope vaccine designed in this study might have a protection potential against the various subtypes of influenza A and B.",

        "Abstract": "Multilayer hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM)-based SERS substrates have received special consideration because they accommodate various propagation modes such as surface plasmonic polaritons (SPP). However, the SPP modes are difficult to generate in HMM due to their weak electric field enhancement. In this article, we designed novel SERS substrates consisting of graphene-covered AgNPs and HMM. The graphene-covered AgNPs work as an external coupling structure for hyperbolic metamaterials due to this structure exhibiting significant plasmonic effects as well as unique optical features. The localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) of the graphene-covered AgNPs excited the SPP and thus formed a strong hot spot zone in the nanogap area of the graphene. The Raman experiment was performed using rhodamine 6G (R6G) and crystal violet (CV), which showed high stability and a maximum enhancement factor of 2.12 \u00d7 10",

        "Abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-syn) has been shown to form various conformational fibrils associated with different synucleinopathies. But whether the conformation of \u03b1-syn fibrils changes during disease progression is unclear. Here, we amplified \u03b1-syn aggregates from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) staged in preclinical PD (pre-PD), middle- to late-stage PD (mid-PD), and late-stage PD (late-PD). Our results show that \u03b1-syn fibrils derived from the late-PD patient are most potent in inducing endogenous \u03b1-syn aggregation in primary neurons, followed by the mid-PD and pre-PD fibrils. By using cryo-electron microscopy, we further determined the high-resolution structures of the CSF-amplified fibrils. The structures exhibit remarkable differences in a minor but significant population of conformational species in different staged samples. Our work demonstrates structural and pathological differences between \u03b1-syn fibrils derived from PD patients at a spectrum of clinical stages, which suggests potential conformational transition of \u03b1-syn fibrils during the progression of PD.",

        "Abstract": "In this work, an efficient polymer-based organic afterglow system, which shows reversible photochromism, switchable ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP), and prominent water and chemical resistance simultaneously, has been developed for the first time. By doping phenoxazine (PXZ) and 10-ethyl-10H-phenoxazine (PXZEt) into epoxy polymers, the resulting PXZ@EP-0.25\u2009% and PXZEt@EP-0.25\u2009% films show unique photoactivated UOP properties, with phosphorescence quantum yields and lifetimes up to 10.8\u2009% and 845\u2005ms, respectively. It is found that the steady-state luminescence and UOP of PXZ@EP-0.25\u2009% are switchable by light irradiation and thermal annealing. Moreover, the doped films can still produce conspicuous UOP after soaking in water, strong acid and base, and organic solvents for more than two weeks, exhibiting outstanding water and chemical resistance. Inspired by these exciting results, the PXZ@EP-0.25\u2009% has been successfully exploited as an erasable transparent film for light printing.",

Multimodal ultrasonography was performed on three patients who had been diagnosed BLs by pathology in our hospital. Two cases of primary BLs appeared hyper hyperechoic and hypoechoic, and one case of second BL appeared isoechoic and hypoechoic. Elastography of two lesions was soft elasticity and the elasticity score was 2 points. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) revealed rapid uniform high enhancement with clearly defined after injection. There are some common features in ultrasound. Combined with those features can help to improve the sonographer's understanding and diagnosis of the BLs.",

        "Abstract": "Due to its absorption properties in atmosphere, the mid-infrared (mid-IR) region has gained interest for its potential to provide high data capacity in free-space optical (FSO) communications. Here, we experimentally demonstrate wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) and mode-division-multiplexing (MDM) in a ~0.5\u2009m mid-IR FSO link. We multiplex three ~3.4\u2009\u03bcm wavelengths (3.396\u2009\u03bcm, 3.397\u2009\u03bcm, and 3.398\u2009\u03bcm) on a single polarization, with each wavelength carrying two orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) beams. As each beam carries 50-Gbit/s quadrature-phase-shift-keying data, a total capacity of 300 Gbit/s is achieved. The WDM channels are generated and detected in the near-IR (C-band). They are converted to mid-IR and converted back to C-band through the difference frequency generation nonlinear processes. We estimate that the system penalties at a bit error rate near the forward error correction threshold include the following: (i) the wavelength conversions induce ~2\u2009dB optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) penalty, (ii) WDM induces ~1\u2009dB OSNR penalty, and (iii) MDM induces ~0.5\u2009dB OSNR penalty. These results show the potential of using multiplexing to achieve a ~30X increase in data capacity for a mid-IR FSO link.",

        "Title": "Effect of integrin \u03b17 on cell proliferation, invasion, apoptosis and the PI3K/AKT pathway, and its association with clinicopathological features in endometrial cancer.",
        "Abstract": "Targeting integrin \u03b17 (ITGA7) suppresses malignant progression of several types of cancer, including tongue squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, while the effect of its knockdown on cell function and its association with clinicopathological features in endometrial cancer (EC) is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate this issue. ITGA7 was knocked down by short-interfering (si)RNA in Ishikawa and RL95-2 cells followed by western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR assays. Subsequently, cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and expression levels of PI3K, phosphorylated (p-) PI3K, AKT and p-AKT were determined using Cell Counting Kit-8, TUNEL, Transwell assays and western blotting. Moreover, ITGA7 in tumor and adjacent tissues from 50 patients with endometrial cancer was detected using immunohistochemical assay. ITGA7 expression was increased in EC cell lines (HEC-1A, RL95-2, Ishikawa and KLE) compared with telomerase-immortalized human endometrial stromal cells (THESCs). In both Ishikawa and RL95-2 cells, three ITGA7 siRNAs all demonstrated good efficiency on ITGA7 knockdown, amongst which the one with the highest efficiency was selected for the following experiments. ITGA7 knockdown reduced cell proliferation and invasion, while inducing apoptosis; moreover, it suppressed p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT ratios. In patients with EC, ITGA7 expression was increased in tumor tissues compared with adjacent tissues, and its lower tumor expression was associated with myometrial invasion (<1/2), non-lymphovascular invasion and decreased FIGO stage. In conclusion, ITGA7 knockdown repressed proliferation, invasion and the PI3K/AKT pathway while inducing apoptosis in EC cell lines, and its insufficiency was associated with less advanced tumor features in EC patients. These results indicated that ITGA7 may be a potential target for the treatment of EC.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, many studies have shown that the gut microbiota can affect the occurrence and development of a variety of human diseases. A variety of skin diseases are related to the regulation of the gut-skin axis, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and acne. Gut microbial dysbiosis can promote the development of these diseases. The gut microbiota can affect estrogen metabolism, \u03b2-glucuronidase secreted by the gut microbiota can promote the reabsorption of estrogen by the gut, and estrogen is transported to other parts of the body through the circulatory system. The occurrence and development of melasma are closely related to abnormal metabolism of estrogen. The relationship between the structure of the gut microbiota and melasma remains unclear. Epidemiological surveys were conducted in patients with melasma and healthy subjects (control group) in this study. The feces were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing analysis of the gut microbiota. To compare the similarities and differences in species diversity of the gut microbiota between these two groups, we calculated the \u03b1-diversity and \u03b2-diversity indices and analyzed the differences between them. We found that the abundance of ",

        "Abstract": "Although yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) has been reported its functions of antiviral, antibacterial, energy balancing, and gut microbiota regulating, its gastrointestinal digestion process and the digestion products have not been studied, which is of great significance for the development of IgY-themed functional foods. This work investigated the digestion behaviors of oral IgY by static digestion simulation in vitro. IgY showed low digestibility (23.97%) in the gastric phase but was highly digestible (89.49% digestibility) in the initial intestinal phase. The entire digestion involved IgY aggregation, degradation, re-aggregation, and gradual decomposition into small pieces (by dynamic light scattering). These results indicated that IgY was impressionable, unstable and changeful in gastrointestinal environment, which might impair the bioactive function of IgY. Over 6 peptides (such as RGFK, TVPSGASTK, VPAATASPR) and 21 amino acids were detected, including 6 essential amino acids (methionine, isoleucine, leucine, histidine, tryptophan, and lysine), suggesting that IgY could be involved in human health regulation as active peptides or as rich sources of amino acids in addition to its own bioactive functions. The digestion kinetic curve confirmed that IgY did not reach its maximum digestion at the end of simulation of intestinal phase, implying the incomplete utilization of IgY. This study provides valuable details of oral IgY for development as active ingredients of a functional food, contributing to boosting the egg industry and improving human health.",
