        "Title": "Robust identification of environmental exposures and community characteristics predictive of rapid lung disease progression.",
        "Abstract": "Environmental exposures and community characteristics have been linked to accelerated lung function decline in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), but geomarkers, the measurements of these exposures, have not been comprehensively evaluated in a single study. To determine which geomarkers have the greatest predictive potential for lung function decline and pulmonary exacerbation (PEx), a retrospective longitudinal cohort study was performed using novel Bayesian joint covariate selection methods, which were compared with respect to PEx predictive accuracy. Non-stationary Gaussian linear mixed effects models were fitted to data from 151 CF patients aged 6-20 receiving care at a CF Center in the midwestern US (2007-2017). The outcome was forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s of percent predicted (FEV1pp). Target functions were used to predict PEx from established criteria. Covariates included 11 routinely collected clinical/demographic characteristics and 45 geomarkers comprising 8 categories. Unique covariate selections via four Bayesian penalized regression models (elastic-net, adaptive lasso, ridge, and lasso) were evaluated at both 95\u00a0% and 90\u00a0% credible intervals (CIs). Resultant models included one to 6 geomarkers (air temperature, percentage of tertiary roads outside urban areas, percentage of impervious nonroad outside urban areas, fine atmospheric particulate matter, fraction achieving high school graduation, and motor vehicle theft) representing weather, impervious descriptor, air pollution, socioeconomic status, and crime categories. Adaptive lasso had the lowest information criteria. For PEx predictive accuracy, covariate selection from the 95\u00a0% CI elastic-net had the highest area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation; 0.780\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.026) along with the 95\u00a0% CI ridge and lasso methods (0.780\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.027). The 95\u00a0% CI elastic-net had the highest sensitivity (0.773\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.083) while the 95\u00a0% CI adaptive lasso had the highest specificity (0.691\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.087), suggesting the need for different geomarker sets depending on monitoring goals. Surveillance of certain geomarkers embedded in prediction algorithms can be used in real-time warning systems for PEx onset.",

        "Abstract": "A prediction model can be a useful tool to quantify the risk of a patient developing dementia in the next years and take risk-factor-targeted intervention. Numerous dementia prediction models have been developed, but few have been externally validated, likely limiting their clinical uptake. In our previous work, we had limited success in externally validating some of these existing models due to inadequate reporting. As a result, we are compelled to develop and externally validate novel models to predict dementia in the general population across a network of observational databases. We assess regularization methods to obtain parsimonious models that are of lower complexity and easier to implement.",

        "Abstract": "Exposure to fluoride in early childhood has been associated with altered cognition, intelligence, attention, and neurobehavior. Fluoride-related neurodevelopment effects have been shown to vary by sex and very little is known about the mechanistic processes involved. There is limited research on how fluoride exposure impacts the epigenome, potentially leading to changes in DNA methylation of specific genes regulating key developmental processes. In the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS), urine samples were analyzed using a microdiffusion method to determine childhood urinary fluoride adjusted for specific gravity (CUFsg) concentrations. Whole blood DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850\u00a0k Array. In a cross-sectional analysis, we interrogated epigenome-wide DNA methylation at 775,141 CpG loci across the methylome in relation to CUFsg concentrations in 272 early adolescents at age 12\u00a0years. Among all participants, higher concentrations of CUF were associated with differential methylation of one CpG (p\u00a0<\u00a06\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010",

        "Abstract": "Using pooled vaginal microbiota data from pregnancy cohorts (N\u2009=\u2009683 participants) in the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program, we analyzed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences to identify clinical and demographic host factors that associate with vaginal microbiota structure in pregnancy both within and across diverse cohorts. Using PERMANOVA models, we assessed factors associated with vaginal community structure in pregnancy, examined whether host factors were conserved across populations, and tested the independent and combined effects of host factors on vaginal community state types (CSTs) using multinomial logistic regression models. Demographic and social factors explained a larger amount of variation in the vaginal microbiome in pregnancy than clinical factors. After adjustment, lower education, rather than self-identified race, remained a robust predictor of L. iners dominant (CST III) and diverse (CST IV) (OR\u2009=\u20098.44, 95% CI\u2009=\u20094.06-17.6 and OR\u2009=\u20094.18, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.88-9.26, respectively). In random forest models, we identified specific taxonomic features of host factors, particularly urogenital pathogens associated with pregnancy complications (Aerococcus christensenii and Gardnerella spp.) among other facultative anaerobes and key markers of community instability (L. iners). Sociodemographic factors were robustly associated with vaginal microbiota structure in pregnancy and should be considered as sources of variation in human microbiome studies.",

        "Abstract": "Propensity score adjustment addresses confounding by balancing covariates in subject treatment groups through matching, stratification, inverse probability weighting, etc. Diagnostics ensure that the adjustment has been effective. A common technique is to check whether the standardized mean difference for each relevant covariate is less than a threshold like 0.1. For small sample sizes, the probability of falsely rejecting the validity of a study because of chance imbalance when no underlying balance exists approaches 1. We propose an alternative diagnostic that checks whether the standardized mean difference statistically significantly exceeds the threshold. Through simulation and real-world data, we find that this diagnostic achieves a better trade-off of type 1 error rate and power than standard nominal threshold tests and not testing for sample sizes from 250 to 4000 and for 20 to 100,000 covariates. In network studies, meta-analysis of effect estimates must be accompanied by meta-analysis of the diagnostics or else systematic confounding may overwhelm the estimated effect. Our procedure for statistically testing balance at both the database level and the meta-analysis level achieves the best balance of type-1 error rate and power. Our procedure supports the review of large numbers of covariates, enabling more rigorous diagnostics.",

        "Abstract": "Translational research requires data at multiple scales of biological organization. Advancements in sequencing and multi-omics technologies have increased the availability of these data, but researchers face significant integration challenges. Knowledge graphs (KGs) are used to model complex phenomena, and methods exist to construct them automatically. However, tackling complex biomedical integration problems requires flexibility in the way knowledge is modeled. Moreover, existing KG construction methods provide robust tooling at the cost of fixed or limited choices among knowledge representation models. PheKnowLator (Phenotype Knowledge Translator) is a semantic ecosystem for automating the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) construction of ontologically grounded KGs with fully customizable knowledge representation. The ecosystem includes KG construction resources (e.g., data preparation APIs), analysis tools (e.g., SPARQL endpoint resources and abstraction algorithms), and benchmarks (e.g., prebuilt KGs). We evaluated the ecosystem by systematically comparing it to existing open-source KG construction methods and by analyzing its computational performance when used to construct 12 different large-scale KGs. With flexible knowledge representation, PheKnowLator enables fully customizable KGs without compromising performance or usability.",

        "Abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and specifically the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is the central regulator of anabolism in skeletal muscle. Among the many functions of this kinase complex is the inhibition of the catabolic process of autophagy; however, less work has been done in investigating the role of autophagy in regulating mTORC1 signaling. Using an in vitro model to better understand the pathways involved, we activated mTORC1 by several different means (growth factors, leucine supplementation, or muscle contraction), alone or with the autophagy inhibitor NSC185058. We found that inhibiting autophagy with NSC185058 suppresses mTORC1 activity, preventing any increase in cellular protein anabolism. These decrements were the direct result of action on the mTORC1 kinase, which we demonstrate, for the first time, cannot function when autophagy is inhibited by NSC185058. Our results indicate that, far from being a matter of unidirectional action, the relationship between mTORC1 and the autophagic cascade is more nuanced, with autophagy serving as an mTORC1 input, and mTORC1 inhibition of autophagy as a form of homeostatic feedback to regulate anabolic signaling. Future studies of cellular metabolism will have to consider this fundamental intertwining of protein anabolism and catabolism, and how it ultimately serves to regulate muscle proteostasis.",

        "Title": "Bone loss in shoulder instability: putting it all together.",
        "Abstract": "Glenohumeral bone loss is frequently observed in cases of recurrent anterior and posterior shoulder instability and represents a risk factor for failure of nonoperative treatment. Patients with suspected glenoid or humeral bone loss in the setting of recurrent instability should be evaluated with a thorough history and physical examination, as well as advanced imaging including computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In cases of both anterior and posterior instability, the magnitude and location of bone loss should be determined, as well as the relationship between the glenoid track (GT) and any humeral defects. While the degree and pattern of osseous deficiency help guide treatment, patient-specific risk factors for recurrent instability must also be considered when determining patient management. Treatment options for subcritical anterior bone loss include labral repair and capsular plication, while more severe deficiency should prompt consideration of bony augmentation including coracoid transfer or free bone block procedures. Concomitant humeral lesions are treated according to the degree of engagement with the glenoid rim and may be addressed with soft tissue remplissage or bony augmentation procedures. While critical and subcritical thresholds of glenoid bone loss guide the management of anterior instability, such thresholds are less defined in the setting of posterior instability. Furthermore, current treatment algorithms are limited by a lack of long-term comparative studies. Future high-quality studies as well as possible modifications in indications and surgical technique are required to elucidate the optimal treatment of anterior, posterior, and bipolar glenohumeral bone loss in the setting of recurrent shoulder instability.",

        "Abstract": "Plants are constantly exposed to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are released during plant-plant communication, within-plant self-signaling, and plant-microbe interactions. Therefore, understanding VOC perception and downstream signaling is vital for unraveling the mechanisms behind information exchange in plants, which remain largely unexplored. Using the hormone-like function of volatile terpenoids in reproductive organ development as a system with a visual marker for communication, we demonstrate that a petunia karrikin-insensitive receptor, PhKAI2ia, stereospecifically perceives the (-)-germacrene D signal, triggering a KAI2-mediated signaling cascade and affecting plant fitness. This study uncovers the role(s) of the intermediate clade of KAI2 receptors, illuminates the involvement of a KAI2ia-dependent signaling pathway in volatile communication, and provides new insights into plant olfaction and the long-standing question about the nature of potential endogenous KAI2 ligand(s).",

        "Abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\u00a0are a valuable class of medications for orthopedic surgeons and often play a pivotal role in pain control. However, there are many common stipulations resulting in avoidance of its use in the treatment of musculoskeletal disease. This review summarizes the mechanism of action of NSAIDs as well as provides an overview of commonly used NSAIDs and the differences between them. It provides a concise summary on the osseous effects of NSAIDs with regard to bone healing and heterotopic ossification. Most of all, it serves as a guide or reference for orthopedic providers when counseling patients on the risks and benefits of NSAID use, as it addresses the common stipulations encountered: \"It irritates my stomach,\" \"I have a history of bariatric surgery,\" \"I'm already on a blood thinner,\" \"I've had a heart attack,\" and \"I've got kidney problems\" and synthesizes both current research and society recommendations regarding safe use and avoidance of NSAIDs.",

Some people with CF experience rapid decline, a precipitous drop in lung function relative to patient- and/or center-level norms. Those who experience rapid decline in early adulthood, compared to adolescence, typically exhibit less severe clinical disease but greater loss of lung function. The extent to which timing and degree of rapid decline are informed by social and environmental determinants of health (geomarkers) is unknown.",

        "Abstract": "The biosynthesis of specialized metabolites is strictly regulated by environmental inputs such as the day-night cycle, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In Petunia hybrida cv. Mitchell flowers, the biosynthesis and emission of volatile compounds display a diurnal pattern with a peak in the evening to attract nocturnal pollinators. Using petunia flowers as a model system, we found that chromatin level regulation, especially histone acetylation, plays an essential role in mediating the day-night oscillation of the biosynthetic gene network of specialized metabolites. By performing time-course chromatin immunoprecipitation assays for histone modifications, we uncovered that a specific group of genes involved in the regulation, biosynthesis, and emission of floral volatile compounds, which displays the greatest magnitude in day-night oscillating gene expression, is associated with highly dynamic histone acetylation marks H3K9ac and H3K27ac. Specifically, the strongest oscillating genes featured a drastic removal of histone acetylation marks at night, potentially to shut down the biosynthesis of floral volatile compounds during the morning when they are not needed. Inhibiting daytime histone acetylation led to a compromised evening induction of these genes. Overall, our study suggested an active role of chromatin modification in the diurnal oscillation of specialized metabolic network.",

        "Abstract": "Environmental stimuli trigger rapid transcriptional reprogramming of gene networks. These responses occur in the context of the local chromatin landscape, but the contribution of organ-specific dynamic chromatin modifications in responses to external signals remains largely unexplored. We treated tomato seedlings with a supply of nitrate and measured the genome-wide changes of four histone marks, the permissive marks H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and H3K36me3 and repressive mark H3K27me3, in shoots and roots separately, as well as H3K9me2 in shoots. Dynamic and organ-specific histone acetylation and methylation were observed at functionally relevant gene loci. Integration of transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets generated from the same organ revealed largely syngenetic relations between changes in transcript levels and histone modifications, with the exception of H3K27me3 in shoots, where an increased level of this repressive mark is observed at genes activated by nitrate. Application of a machine learning approach revealed organ-specific rules regarding the importance of individual histone marks, as H3K36me3 is the most successful mark in predicting gene regulation events in shoots, while H3K4me3 is the strongest individual predictor in roots. Our integrated study substantiates a view that during plant environmental responses, the relationships between histone code dynamics and gene regulation are highly dependent on organ-specific contexts.",

        "Abstract": "Postmarket safety surveillance is an integral part of mass vaccination programs. Typically relying on sequential analysis of real-world health data as they accrue, safety surveillance is challenged by sequential multiple testing and by biases induced by residual confounding in observational data. The current standard approach based on the maximized sequential probability ratio test (MaxSPRT) fails to satisfactorily address these practical challenges and it remains a rigid framework that requires prespecification of the surveillance schedule. We develop an alternative Bayesian surveillance procedure that addresses both aforementioned challenges using a more flexible framework. To mitigate bias, we jointly analyze a large set of negative control outcomes that are adverse events with no known association with the vaccines in order to inform an empirical bias distribution, which we then incorporate into estimating the effect of vaccine exposure on the adverse event of interest through a Bayesian hierarchical model. To address multiple testing and improve on flexibility, at each analysis timepoint, we update a posterior probability in favor of the alternative hypothesis that vaccination induces higher risks of adverse events, and then use it for sequential detection of safety signals. Through an empirical evaluation using six US observational healthcare databases covering more than 360 million patients, we benchmark the proposed procedure against MaxSPRT on testing errors and estimation accuracy, under two epidemiological designs, the historical comparator and the self-controlled case series. We demonstrate that our procedure substantially reduces Type 1 error rates, maintains high statistical power and fast signal detection, and provides considerably more accurate estimation than MaxSPRT. Given the extensiveness of the empirical study which yields more than 7 million sets of results, we present all results in a public R ShinyApp. As an effort to promote open science, we provide full implementation of our method in the open-source R package EvidenceSynthesis.",

        "Abstract": "There is a limited understanding about how an association with those that download Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), a highly stigmatized crime, impacts the lives of their innocent family members. Non-offending family members are often considered a valuable protective resource for offender desistance and in safeguarding children from abuse. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the lived experiences of female family members of CSAM offenders in Ireland and the United Kingdom to both identify and target areas for intervention thus ameliorating their ability to protect. A qualitative research design was adopted, and data analyzed via reflexive thematic analysis. Fifteen individuals self-selected for participation and interviews resulted in the identification of three key themes: ",

        "Abstract": "We carry out an analysis of gender differences in patterns of disease diagnosis across four large observational health datasets and find that women are routinely older when first assigned most diagnoses. Among 112 acute and chronic diseases, women experience longer lengths of time between symptom onset and disease diagnosis than men for most diseases regardless of metric used, even when only symptoms common to both genders are considered. These findings are consistent for patients with private as well as government insurance. Our analysis highlights systematic gender differences in patterns of disease diagnosis and suggests that symptoms of disease are measured or weighed differently for women and men. Data and code leverage the open-source common data model and analytic code and results are publicly available.",

        "Abstract": "Individual case reports are the main asset in pharmacovigilance signal management. Signal validation is the first stage after signal detection and aims to determine if there is sufficient evidence to justify further assessment. Throughout signal management, a prioritization of signals is continually made. Routinely collected health data can provide relevant contextual information but are primarily used at a later stage in pharmacoepidemiological studies to assess communicated signals.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe the feasibility of implementing suicide risk screening in a virtual addiction clinic. Suicide risk screening was implemented in a virtual addiction clinic serving individuals with substance use disorders (SUD) using a quality improvement framework. One-hundred percent (252/252) of eligible patients enrolled in the clinic were screened for suicide risk (44% female; M[SD] age\u2009=\u200945.0[11.0] years, range\u2009=\u200921-68\u00a0years). Nineteen patients (8%) screened positive for suicide risk. After screening, no patients required emergency suicide interventions (100% non-acute positive). Notably, 74% (14/19) of those who screened positive did so by endorsing at least one past suicide attempt with no recent ideation. Suicide risk screening in virtual addiction clinics yields important clinical information for high-risk SUD populations without overburdening workflow with emergency services. Given the high proportion of non-acute positive screens based on suicide attempt histories with no recent ideation, clinicians may utilize information on suicide attempt history to facilitate further mental healthcare.",

Since 2013, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has led the development of the Disaster Research Response (DR2) program and infrastructure; however, research exploring the nature and effects of disasters on human health is lacking. One reason for this research gap is the challenge of developing and deploying cost-effective sensors for exposure assessment during disaster events.",

Existing DeGAUSS (Decentralized Geomarker Assessment for Multisite Studies) software has been successfully implemented in multi-site studies, ensuring reproducibility and protection of health information. However, DeGAUSS relies on transporting geomarker data, which is not feasible for high-resolution spatiotemporal data too large to store locally or download over the internet. We expanded the DeGAUSS framework for high-resolution spatiotemporal geomarkers. Our approach stores data subsets based on coarsened location and year in an online repository, and appropriate subsets are downloaded to complete exposure assessment locally using exact date and location. We created and validated two free and open-source DeGAUSS containers for estimation of high-resolution, daily ambient air pollutant exposures, transforming published exposure assessment models into computable exposures for geomarker assessment at scale.",

        "Abstract": "Common data models solve many challenges of standardizing electronic health record (EHR) data but are unable to semantically integrate all of the resources needed for deep phenotyping. Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry ontologies provide computable representations of biological knowledge and enable the integration of heterogeneous data. However, mapping EHR data to OBO ontologies requires significant manual curation and domain expertise. We introduce OMOP2OBO, an algorithm for mapping Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) vocabularies to OBO ontologies. Using OMOP2OBO, we produced mappings for 92,367 conditions, 8611 drug ingredients, and 10,673 measurement results, which covered 68-99% of concepts used in clinical practice when examined across 24 hospitals. When used to phenotype rare disease patients, the mappings helped systematically identify undiagnosed patients who might benefit from genetic testing. By aligning OMOP vocabularies to OBO ontologies our algorithm presents new opportunities to advance EHR-based deep phenotyping.",

        "Abstract": "Tumoral calcinosis is a hereditary disease of calcium and phosphate metabolism causing peri-articular tumors of calcium deposits. We present a case of tumoral calcinosis in a 13-year-old male with a history of a 12q13.11 genetic deletion. Surgical resection of the tumor necessitated resection of the ACL in its entirety with curettage and adjuvant therapy to the lateral femoral notch, which resulted in ligamentous instability and bony structural incompetency at the femoral insertion. Given the patient's radiographically-apparent skeletal immaturity, and lack of reliable bony architecture to accommodate a femoral ACL tunnel, ACL reconstruction was performed using a physeal-sparing technique. This is a case of tumoral calcinosis treated with, to our knowledge, the first ACL reconstruction using this modified open technique.",

        "Abstract": "Early detection of risk is a key suicide prevention strategy. Given that most individuals who die by suicide visit a health care provider in the year leading up to their death, medical settings are ideal venues for identifying those at elevated risk and bridging them to life-saving care. Clinicians are presented with an opportunity to engage in proactive suicide prevention efforts through practical and adaptable suicide risk screening, assessment, and management processes. Psychiatrists and mental health clinicians are well positioned to assist nonpsychiatric clinicians on the frontlines of this public health problem. This article discusses the importance of identifying people at elevated suicide risk through screening, differentiates screening from assessment procedures, and presents practical strategies for implementing evidence-based screening and assessment tools into practice as part of a three-tiered clinical pathway. Specifically, this article discusses key components that guide embedding suicide prevention strategies into the workflows of busy medical settings.",

        "Abstract": "Suicide and suicidal behavior among youth and young adults are a major public health crisis, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrated by increases in suicidal ideation and attempts among youth. Supports are needed to identify youth at risk and intervene in safe and effective ways. To address this need, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, in collaboration with experts from the National Institute of Mental Health, developed the Blueprint for Youth Suicide Prevention ( Blueprint ) to translate research into strategies that are feasible, pragmatic, and actionable across all contexts in which youth live, learn, work, and play. In this piece, we describe the process of developing and disseminating the Blueprint. Through a summit and focus meetings, cross-sectoral partners convened to discuss the context of suicide risk among youth; explore the landscape of science, practice, and policy; build partnerships; and identify strategies for clinics, communities, and schools-all with a focus on health disparities and equity. These meetings resulted in 5 major takeaways: (1) suicide is often preventable; (2) health equity is critical to suicide prevention; (3) individual and systems changes are needed; (4) resilience should be a key focus; and (5) cross-sectoral partnerships are critical. These meetings and takeaways then informed the content of the Blueprint , which discusses the epidemiology of youth and young adult suicide and suicide risk, including health disparities; the importance of a public health framework; risk factors, protective factors, and warning signs; strategies for clinical settings, strategies for community and school settings; and policy priorities. Following the process description, lessons learned are also discussed, followed by a call to action for the public health community and all who serve and support youth. Finally, key steps to establishing and sustaining partnerships and implications for policy and practice are discussed.",

Such studies require developing executable algorithms to find patients of interest or phenotype algorithms. Creating reliable and comprehensive phenotype algorithms in data networks is especially hard as differences in patient representation and data heterogeneity must be considered. In this paper, we discuss a process for creating a comprehensive concept set and a recommender system we built to facilitate it. PHenotype Observed Entity Baseline Endorsements (PHOEBE) uses the data on code utilization across 22 electronic health record and claims datasets mapped to the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Common Data Model from the 6 countries to recommend semantically and lexically similar codes. Coupled with Cohort Diagnostics, it is now used in major network OHDSI studies. When used to create patient cohorts, PHOEBE identifies more patients and captures them earlier in the course of the disease.",

        "Abstract": "Treatment effects are often anticipated to vary across groups of patients with different baseline risk. The Predictive Approaches to Treatment Effect Heterogeneity (PATH) statement focused on baseline risk as a robust predictor of treatment effect and provided guidance on risk-based assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity in a randomized controlled trial. The aim of this study is to extend this approach to the observational setting using a standardized scalable framework. The proposed framework consists of five steps: (1) definition of the research aim, i.e., the population, the treatment, the comparator and the outcome(s) of interest; (2) identification of relevant databases; (3) development of a prediction model for the outcome(s) of interest; (4) estimation of relative and absolute treatment effect within strata of predicted risk, after adjusting for observed confounding; (5) presentation of the results. We demonstrate our framework by evaluating heterogeneity of the effect of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on three efficacy and nine safety outcomes across three observational databases. We provide a publicly available R software package for applying this framework to any database mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. In our demonstration, patients at low risk of acute myocardial infarction receive negligible absolute benefits for all three efficacy outcomes, though they are more pronounced in the highest risk group, especially for acute myocardial infarction. Our framework allows for the evaluation of differential treatment effects across risk strata, which offers the opportunity to consider the benefit-harm trade-off between alternative treatments.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical documentation in electronic health records contains crucial narratives and details about patients and their care. Natural language processing (NLP) can unlock the information conveyed in clinical notes and reports, and thus plays a critical role in real-world studies. The NLP Working Group at the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) consortium was established to develop methods and tools to promote the use of textual data and NLP in real-world observational studies. In this paper, we describe a framework for representing and utilizing textual data in real-world evidence generation, including representations of information from clinical text in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), the workflow and tools that were developed to extract, transform and load (ETL) data from clinical notes into tables in OMOP CDM, as well as current applications and specific use cases of the proposed OHDSI NLP solution at large consortia and individual institutions with English textual data. Challenges faced and lessons learned during the process are also discussed to provide valuable insights for researchers who are planning to implement NLP solutions in real-world studies.",

        "Abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a highly dynamic organ that is essential for locomotion as well as endocrine regulation in all populations of horses. However, despite the importance of adequate muscle development and maintenance, the mechanisms underlying protein anabolism in horses on different diets, exercise programs, and at different life stages remain obscure. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key component of the protein synthesis pathway and is regulated by biological factors such as insulin and amino acid availability. Providing a diet ample in vital amino acids, such as leucine and glutamine, is essential in activating sensory pathways that recruit mTOR to the lysosome and assist in the translation of important downstream targets. When the diet is well balanced, mitochondrial biogenesis and protein synthesis are activated in response to increased exercise bouts in the performing athlete. It is important to note that the mTOR kinase pathways are multifaceted and very complex, with several binding partners and targets that lead to specific functions in protein turnover of the cell, and ultimately, the capacity to maintain or grow muscle mass. Further, these pathways are likely altered across the lifespan, with an emphasis of growth in young horses while decreases in musculature with aged horses appears to be attributable to degradation or other regulators of protein synthesis rather than alterations in the mTOR pathway. Previous work has begun to pinpoint ways in which the mTOR pathway is influenced by diet, exercise, and age; however, future research is warranted to quantify the functional outcomes related to changes in mTOR. Promisingly, this could provide direction on appropriate management techniques to support skeletal muscle growth and maximize athletic potential in differing equine populations.",

Nonreproducibility is primarily caused by unclear reporting of design choices and analytic procedures. This study aimed to: (1) assess how the study logic described in an observational study could be interpreted by independent researchers and (2) quantify the impact of interpretations' variability on patient characteristics.",

        "Abstract": "Since 1995, Hery's trichloramine sampling procedure has been widely used to determine trichloramine exposure in indoor swimming pools. This method consists of pumping air at a 1\u00a0L/min flow rate for 2\u00a0h through a Teflon prefilter and two quartz fiber filters. Modified Hery methods have been reported using different sampling pump flow rates and types of prefilters. It is possible that the prefilter type or sample collection pump flow rate influenced the results of these studies. This study is designed to evaluate the effects of different cassette assemblies and sampling flow rates on the levels of measured trichloramine. Laboratory tests were performed using a trichloramine production setup designed for this study. Workplace measurements were carried out at four indoor swimming pools. Different prefiltering strategies were used: no prefilter, glass prefilter or Teflon prefilter in the sampling cassette, and an original separable prefilter cassette is presented in this study. Laboratory tests indicated that at trichloramine concentrations higher than 1\u00a0mg/m",

        "Abstract": "Although small spills of non-ideal organic solvent mixtures are ubiquitous undesirable events in occupational settings, the potential risk of exposure associated with such scenarios remains insufficiently investigated. This study aimed to examine the impact of non-ideality on evaporation rates and contaminant air concentrations resulting from small spills of organic solvent mixtures. Evaporation rate constants alphas (\u03b1) were experimentally measured for five pure solvents using a gravimetric approach during solvent evaporation tests designed to simulate small spills of solvents. Two equations were used for estimating contaminants' evaporation rates from aqueous mixtures assuming either ideal or non-ideal behavior based on the pure-chemical alpha values. A spill model also known as the well-mixed room model with exponentially decreasing emission rate was used to predict air concentrations during various spill scenarios based on the two sets of estimated evaporation rates. Model predictive performance was evaluated by comparing the estimates against real-time concentrations measured for the same scenarios. Evaluations for 12 binary non-ideal aqueous mixtures found that the estimated evaporation rates accounting for the correction by the activity coefficients of the solvents (median = 0.0318\u2009min",

To date, the role of histone modifications in regulating plant responses to environmental nutrient availability, especially in agriculturally important species, remains largely unknown.

Moreover, the link between air pollution and poor mental health may relate to neurostructural and neurofunctional changes. We systematically reviewed the MEDLINE database in September 2021 for original articles reporting effects of air pollution on 1) internalizing symptoms and behaviors (anxiety or depression) and 2) frontolimbic brain regions (i.e., hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex). One hundred and eleven articles on mental health (76% human, 24% animals) and 92 on brain structure and function (11% human, 86% animals) were identified. For literature search 1, the most common pollutants examined were PM",

        "Abstract": "Phenotype algorithms are central to performing analyses using observational data. These algorithms translate the clinical idea of a health condition into an executable set of rules allowing for queries of data elements from a database. PheValuator, a software package in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) tool stack, provides a method to assess the performance characteristics of these algorithms, namely, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value. It uses machine learning to develop predictive models for determining a probabilistic gold standard of subjects for assessment of cases and non-cases of health conditions. PheValuator was developed to complement or even replace the traditional approach of algorithm validation, i.e., by expert assessment of subject records through chart review. Results in our first PheValuator paper suggest a systematic underestimation of the PPV compared to previous results using chart review. In this paper we evaluate modifications made to the method designed to improve its performance.",

The etiology of mental health disorders includes genetic, social, and environmental factors. Ultrafine particles (UFPs; particles less than 0.1 \u03bcm in diameter) have been shown to exert neurotoxic effects on the brain; however, epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between UFPs and childhood mental health outcomes is unclear. The objective of this study was to determine if exposure to UFPs was associated with symptoms of mental health in adolescents. Adolescents completed personal UFP monitoring for one week as well as a series of validated Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) assessments to measure five domains of mental and physical stress symptoms. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the association between PROMIS ",

        "Abstract": "Suicide is a serious public health concern. On average, 80% of suicide decedents had contact with primary care within 1 year of their suicide. This and other research underscore the importance of screening for suicide risk within primary care settings, and implementation of suicide risk screening is already underway in many practices. However, while primary care practices may be familiar with screening for other mental health concerns (e.g., depression), many feel uncomfortable or unprepared for suicide risk screening. To meet the increasing demand for evidence-based suicide-risk-screening guidance, we provide a clinical pathway for adult primary care practices (to include family medicine, internal medicine, women's health). The pathway was developed by experts with research, clinical expertise, and experience in suicide risk screening and primary care. We also provide detailed guidance to aid primary care practices in their decisions about how to implement the clinical pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Prognostic models that are accurate could help aid medical decision making. Large observational databases often contain temporal medical data for large and diverse populations of patients. It may be possible to learn prognostic models using the large observational data. Often the performance of a prognostic model undesirably worsens when transported to a different database (or into a clinical setting). In this study we investigate different ensemble approaches that combine prognostic models independently developed using different databases (a simple federated learning approach) to determine whether ensembles that combine models developed across databases can improve model transportability (perform better in new data than single database models)?",

        "Abstract": "External validation of prediction models is increasingly being seen as a minimum requirement for acceptance in clinical practice. However, the lack of interoperability of healthcare databases has been the biggest barrier to this occurring on a large scale. Recent improvements in database interoperability enable a standardized analytical framework for model development and external validation. External validation of a model in a new database lacks context, whereby the external validation can be compared with a benchmark in this database. Iterative pairwise external validation (IPEV) is a framework that uses a rotating model development and validation approach to contextualize the assessment of performance across a network of databases. As a use case, we predicted 1-year risk of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

        "Title": "Current Approaches to Vaccine Safety Using Observational Data: A Rationale for the EUMAEUS (Evaluating Use of Methods for Adverse Events Under Surveillance-for Vaccines) Study Design.",
        "Abstract": "Post-marketing vaccine safety surveillance aims to detect adverse events following immunization in a population. Whether certain methods of surveillance are more precise and unbiased in generating safety signals is unclear. Here, we synthesized information from existing literature to provide an overview of the strengths, weaknesses, and clinical applications of epidemiologic and analytical methods used in vaccine monitoring, focusing on cohort, case-control and self-controlled designs. These designs are proposed to be evaluated in the EUMAEUS (Evaluating Use of Methods for Adverse Event Under Surveillance-for vaccines) study because of their widespread use and potential utility. Over the past decades, there have been an increasing number of epidemiological study designs used for vaccine safety surveillance. While traditional cohort and case-control study designs remain widely used, newer, novel designs such as the self-controlled case series and self-controlled risk intervals have been developed. Each study design comes with its strengths and limitations, and the most appropriate study design will depend on availability of resources, access to records, number and distribution of cases, and availability of population coverage data. Several assumptions have to be made while using the various study designs, and while the goal is to mitigate any biases, violations of these assumptions are often still present to varying degrees. In our review, we discussed some of the potential biases (i.e., selection bias, misclassification bias and confounding bias), and ways to mitigate them. While the types of epidemiological study designs are well established, a comprehensive comparison of the analytical aspects (including method evaluation and performance metrics) of these study designs are relatively less well studied. We summarized the literature, reporting on two simulation studies, which compared the detection time, empirical power, error rate and risk estimate bias across the above-mentioned study designs. While these simulation studies provided insights on the analytic performance of each of the study designs, its applicability to real-world data remains unclear. To bridge that gap, we provided the rationale of the EUMAEUS study, with a brief description of the study design; and how the use of real-world multi-database networks can provide insights into better methods evaluation and vaccine safety surveillance.",

        "Abstract": "Linear mixed models are commonly used in healthcare-based association analyses for analyzing multi-site data with heterogeneous site-specific random effects. Due to regulations for protecting patients' privacy, sensitive individual patient data (IPD) typically cannot be shared across sites. We propose an algorithm for fitting distributed linear mixed models (DLMMs) without sharing IPD across sites. This algorithm achieves results identical to those achieved using pooled IPD from multiple sites (i.e., the same effect size and standard error estimates), hence demonstrating the lossless property. The algorithm requires each site to contribute minimal\u00a0aggregated data in only one round of communication. We demonstrate the lossless property of the proposed DLMM algorithm by investigating the associations between demographic and clinical characteristics and length of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients using administrative claims from the UnitedHealth Group Clinical Discovery Database. We extend this association study by incorporating 120,609 COVID-19 patients from 11 collaborative data sources worldwide.",

        "Title": "Popular interventions to enhance sustained attention in children and adolescents: A critical systematic review.",
        "Abstract": "There are a myriad of interventions promoting activities designed to help enhance sustained attention in children and adolescents. In this systematic review, we critically evaluate the evidence behind three popular sustained attention training approaches - cognitive attention training, meditation, and physical activity. Seven databases were searched in addition to secondary searches. Cognitive attention training, meditation training or physical activity intervention studies aimed at improving sustained attention (randomised-controlled or non-randomised-controlled designs) in samples of children and adolescents (3-18 years) were included. We screened 3437 unique articles. Thirty-seven studies satisfied inclusion criteria. In general, cognitive attention training (n\u00a0=\u00a014) did not reliably improve sustained attention. Physical activity (n\u00a0=\u00a015) and meditation interventions (n\u00a0=\u00a08) demonstrated somewhat more potential in enhancing sustained attention, but these effects should be considered preliminary and need to be replicated with greater methodological rigour. Cognitive attention training demonstrated very limited transfer to other aspects of attention. Notably, mindfulness training had rather consistent positive effects on selective attention. Across all three intervention types, there was very weak evidence for transfer to other aspects of cognition, behaviour, and academic achievement. The paper concludes with methodological recommendations for future studies to strengthen the evidence base.",

Limited research has been conducted to assess localized seasonal fluctuation in lung function decline in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) in context with routinely collected demographic and clinical data. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study of 253 individuals aged 6-22 years with CF receiving care at a pediatric Midwestern US CF center with median (range) of follow-up time of 4.7 (0-9.95) years, implementing two distinct models to estimate seasonality effects. The outcome, lung function, was measured as percent-predicted of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV",

        "Abstract": "Sustained attention and working memory are two closely intertwined executive functions that may underlie inattentive behavior. However, little research has teased apart their precise contributions in a single study. This study examines the extent to which ratings of children's inattentive behavior are associated with these executive functions. Specifically, we investigated the unique and overlapping statistical contributions of sustained attention capacity and working memory capacity to parent and teacher ratings of inattentive behavior (operationalized as scores on both the Inattentive and Hyperactive/Impulsive scales of the Conners' Rating Scale), while controlling for IQ. Children aged 8-11\u00a0years completed measures of sustained attention capacity, working memory capacity and IQ. Parents and teachers completed Conners-3 Parent and Teacher Short Forms, as a measure of inattentive behavior. We found that the unique statistical contribution of sustained attention capacity emerged as the most important factor in both parent and teacher ratings of inattentive behavior, with effects of moderate magnitude. In contrast, working memory capacity accounted for a small amount of variance. The overlap between sustained attention and working memory explained a small but substantive amount of variance in inattentive behavior. These findings support the idea that sustained attention and working memory are distinct executive functions that may contribute to goal-directed behavior both uniquely and through their interactions.",

        "Title": "Predictors of diagnostic transition from major depressive disorder to bipolar disorder: a retrospective observational network study.",
        "Abstract": "Many patients with bipolar disorder (BD) are initially misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and are treated with antidepressants, whose potential iatrogenic effects are widely discussed. It is unknown whether MDD is a comorbidity of BD or its earlier stage, and no consensus exists on individual conversion predictors, delaying BD's timely recognition and treatment. We aimed to build a predictive model of MDD to BD conversion and to validate it across a multi-national network of patient databases using the standardization afforded by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. Five \"training\" US databases were retrospectively analyzed: IBM MarketScan CCAE, MDCR, MDCD, Optum EHR, and Optum Claims. Cyclops regularized logistic regression models were developed on one-year MDD-BD conversion with all standard covariates from the HADES PatientLevelPrediction package. Time-to-conversion Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed up to a decade after MDD, stratified by model-estimated risk. External validation of the final prediction model was performed across 9 patient record databases within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network internationally. The model's area under the curve (AUC) varied 0.633-0.745 (\u00b5 = 0.689) across the five US training databases. Nine variables predicted one-year MDD-BD transition. Factors that increased risk were: younger age, severe depression, psychosis, anxiety, substance misuse, self-harm thoughts/actions, and prior mental disorder. AUCs of the validation datasets ranged 0.570-0.785 (\u00b5 = 0.664). An assessment algorithm was built for MDD to BD conversion that allows distinguishing as much as 100-fold risk differences among patients and validates well across multiple international data sources.",

        "Abstract": "Using real-world data and past vaccination data, we conducted a large-scale experiment to quantify bias, precision and timeliness of different study designs to estimate historical background (expected) compared to post-vaccination (observed) rates of safety events for several vaccines. We used negative (not causally related) and positive control outcomes. The latter were synthetically generated true safety signals with incident rate ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4. Observed vs. expected analysis using within-database historical background rates is a sensitive but unspecific method for the identification of potential vaccine safety signals. Despite good discrimination, most analyses showed a tendency to overestimate risks, with 20%-100% type 1 error, but low (0% to 20%) type 2 error in the large databases included in our study. Efforts to improve the comparability of background and post-vaccine rates, including age-sex adjustment and anchoring background rates around a visit, reduced type 1 error and improved precision but residual systematic error persisted. Additionally, empirical calibration dramatically reduced type 1 to nominal but came at the cost of increasing type 2 error.",

TKR is a safe and cost-effective surgical procedure for treating severe knee osteoarthritis (OA). Although complications following surgery are rare, prediction tools could help identify high-risk patients who could be targeted with preventative interventions. The aim was to develop and validate a simple model to help inform treatment choices.",

        "Title": "ODORANT1 targets multiple metabolic networks in petunia flowers.",
        "Abstract": "Scent bouquets produced by the flowers of Petunia\u2009spp. (petunia) are composed of a complex mixture of floral volatile benzenoid and phenylpropanoid compounds (FVBPs), which are specialized metabolites derived from phenylalanine (Phe) through an interconnected network of enzymes. The biosynthesis and emission of high levels of these volatiles requires coordinated transcriptional activation of both primary and specialized metabolic networks. The petunia R2R3-MYB transcription factor ODORANT\u20091 (ODO1) was identified as a master regulator of FVBP production and emission; however, our knowledge of the direct regulatory targets of ODO1 has remained limited. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) in petunia flowers, we identify genome-wide ODO1-bound genes that are enriched not only in genes involved in the biosynthesis of the Phe precursor, as previously reported, but also genes associated with the specialized metabolic pathways involved in generating phenylpropanoid intermediates for FVBPs. ODO1-bound genes are also involved in methionine and S-adenosylmethionine metabolism, which could modulate methyl group supplies for certain FVBPs. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and RNA-seq analysis in an ODO1 RNAi knockdown line revealed that ODO1-bound targets are expressed at lower levels when ODO1 is suppressed. A cis-regulatory motif, CACCAACCCC, was identified as a potential binding site for ODO1 in the promoters of genes that are both bound and activated by ODO1, which was validated by in\u2009planta promoter reporter assays with wild-type and mutated promoters. Overall, our work presents a mechanistic model for ODO1 controlling an extensive gene regulatory network that contributes to FVBP production to give rise to floral scent.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine and compare environmental microbiota from dust and children's respiratory health outcomes at ages seven and twelve. At age seven, in-home visits were conducted for children enrolled in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS). Floor dust was collected and analyzed for bacterial (16\u00a0S rRNA gene) and fungal (internal transcribed spacer region) microbiota. Respiratory outcomes, including physician-diagnosed asthma, wheeze, rhinitis, and aeroallergen sensitivity were assessed by physical examination and caregiver-report at ages seven and twelve. The associations between dust microbiota and respiratory outcomes were evaluated using Permanova, DESeq, and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression models. Four types of WQS regression models were run to identify mixtures of fungi or bacteria that were associated with the absence or presence of health outcomes. For alpha or beta diversity of fungi and bacteria, no significant associations were found with respiratory health outcomes. DESeq identified specific bacterial and fungal indicator taxa that were higher or lower with the presence of different health outcomes. Most individual indicator fungal species were lower with asthma and wheeze and higher with aeroallergen positivity and rhinitis, whereas bacterial data was less consistent. WQS regression models demonstrated that a combination of species might influence health outcomes. Several heavily weighted species had a strong influence on the models, and therefore, created a microbial community that was associated with the absence or presence of asthma, wheeze, rhinitis, and aeroallergen+. Weights for specific species within WQS regression models supported indicator taxa findings. Health outcomes might be more influenced by the composition of a complex mixture of bacterial and fungal species in the indoor environment than by the absence or presence of individual species. This study demonstrates that WQS is a useful tool in evaluating mixtures in relation to potential health effects.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical research networks (CRNs), made up of multiple healthcare systems each with patient data from several care sites, are beneficial for studying rare outcomes and increasing generalizability of results. While CRNs encourage sharing aggregate data across healthcare systems, individual systems within CRNs often cannot share patient-level data due to privacy regulations, prohibiting multi-site regression which requires an analyst to access all individual patient data pooled together. Meta-analysis is commonly used to model data stored at multiple institutions within a CRN but can result in biased estimation, most notably in rare-event contexts. We present a communication-efficient, privacy-preserving algorithm for modeling multi-site zero-inflated count outcomes within a CRN. Our method, a one-shot distributed algorithm for performing hurdle regression (ODAH), models zero-inflated count data stored in multiple sites without sharing patient-level data across sites, resulting in estimates closely approximating those that would be obtained in a pooled patient-level data analysis. We evaluate our method through extensive simulations and two real-world data applications using electronic health records: examining risk factors associated with pediatric avoidable hospitalization and modeling serious adverse event frequency associated with a colorectal cancer therapy. In simulations, ODAH produced bias less than 0.1% across all settings explored while meta-analysis estimates exhibited bias up to 12.7%, with meta-analysis performing worst in settings with high zero-inflation or low event rates. Across both applied analyses, ODAH estimates had less than 10% bias for 18 of 20 coefficients estimated, while meta-analysis estimates exhibited substantially higher bias. Relative to existing methods for distributed data analysis, ODAH offers a highly accurate, computationally efficient method for modeling multi-site zero-inflated count data.",

        "Title": "Towards a broader concept of wellbeing in evaluating paediatric quality of life.",
        "Abstract": "Paediatric health-care professionals have a primary duty to promote the best interests of their patients. This is reiterated in article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and is predicated on promoting children's health and wellbeing. However, there is ambiguity over what standard applies when evaluating whether a paediatric health-care decision supports good outcomes. Values like 'best interests', 'doing no harm' or 'quality of life' may be indeterminate or vague and clinicians may have difficulty in conceptualising what exactly constitutes 'a good life' for children. This uncertainty leads to the question: how do we best evaluate paediatric health decisions and outcomes? Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are questionnaires that aim to achieve this by attaining data on a patient's quality of life and wellbeing. While PROMs originated with adult cohorts, they have since been applied to paediatric populations. Children are vulnerable due to their interdependency; and this raises ethical tensions regarding the potential benefits of such data, respect for autonomy and assent/consent of the individual child in clinical settings. These inherent tensions should be balanced by realising a collective good for children. PROMs should be a robust data collection source that facilitates substantive justice, both procedurally and in distributing limited health resources via accurate quality-adjusted life-years generation. This article aims to (i) overview the traditional and emerging paediatric PROMs; (ii) outline the tensions of using PROMS for children in a clinical setting and (iii) analyse the ability of traditional and emerging PROMs to promote justice in paediatric resource allocation.",

        "Title": "Assessment of the Oxidative Potential and Oxidative Burden from Occupational Exposures to Particulate Matter.",
        "Abstract": "Oxidative potential (OP) is a toxicologically relevant metric that integrates features like mass concentration and chemical composition of particulate matter (PM). Although it has been extensively explored as a metric for the characterization of environmental particles, this is still an underexplored application in the occupational field. This study aimed to estimate the OP of particles in two occupational settings from a construction trades school. This characterization also includes the comparison between activities, sampling strategies, and size fractions. Particulate mass concentrations (PM4-Personal, PM4-Area, and PM2.5-Area) and number concentrations were measured during three weeks of welding and construction/bricklaying activities. The OP was assessed by the ascorbate assay (OPAA) using a synthetic respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF), while the oxidative burden (OBAA) was determined by multiplying the OPAA values with PM concentrations. Median (25th-75th percentiles) of PM mass and number concentrations were 900 (672-1730) \u00b5g m-3 and 128 000 (78 000-169 000) particles cm-3 for welding, and 432 (345-530) \u00b5g m-3 and 2800 (1700-4400) particles cm-3 for construction. Welding particles, especially from the first week of activities, were also associated with higher redox activity (OPAA: 3.3 (2.3-4.6) \u03c1mol min-1 \u00b5g-1; OBAA: 1750 (893-4560) \u03c1mol min-1 m-3) compared to the construction site (OPAA: 1.4 (1.0-1.8) \u03c1mol min-1 \u00b5g-1; OBAA: 486 (341-695) \u03c1mol min-1 m-3). The OPAA was independent of the sampling strategy or size fraction. However, driven by the higher PM concentrations, the OBAA from personal samples was higher compared to area samples in the welding shop, suggesting an influence of the sampling strategy on PM concentrations and OBAA. These results demonstrate that important levels of OPAA can be found in occupational settings, especially during welding activities. Furthermore, the OBAA found in both workplaces largely exceeded the levels found in environmental studies. Therefore, measures of OP and OB could be further explored as metrics for exposure assessment to occupational PM, as well as for associations with cardiorespiratory outcomes in future occupational epidemiological studies.",

        "Abstract": "Introduced in the 1950s, acetaminophen is one of the most widely used antipyretics and analgesics worldwide. In 1999, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reviewed the epidemiologic studies of acetaminophen and the data were judged to be \"inadequate\" to conclude that it is carcinogenic. In 2019 the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment initiated a review process on the carcinogenic hazard potential of acetaminophen. To inform this review process, the authors performed a comprehensive literature search and identified 136 epidemiologic studies, which for most cancer types suggest no alteration in risk associated with acetaminophen use. For 3 cancer types, renal cell, liver, and some forms of lymphohematopoietic, some studies suggest an increased risk; however, multiple factors unique to acetaminophen need to be considered to determine if these results are real and clinically meaningful. The objective of this publication is to analyze the results of these epidemiologic studies using a framework that accounts for the inherent challenge of evaluating acetaminophen, including, broad population-wide use in multiple disease states, challenges with exposure measurement, protopathic bias, channeling bias, and recall bias. When evaluated using this framework, the data do not support a causal association between acetaminophen use and cancer.",

This case study reports on a 56-year-old woman who developed OVT 11\u00a0days after a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Imaging including abdominal/pelvic computed tomography, transvaginal Doppler ultrasound and transabdominal pelvic ultrasound failed to definitively diagnose the thrombotic etiology of the patient's presentation. Ultimately, laparoscopic visualization and subsequent oophorectomy were necessary for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The patient did not have underlying malignancy, recent surgical history, history of PID or any history of previous thromboembolic events. Therefore, this report contributes further evidence to the growing knowledge of systemic manifestations associated with COVID-19 that may require surgical intervention.",

        "Abstract": "This study develops a comprehensive method to assess seasonal influences on a longitudinal marker and compare estimates between cohorts. The method extends existing approaches by (i) combining a sine-cosine model of seasonality with a specialized covariance function for modeling longitudinal correlation; (ii) performing mediation analysis on a seasonality model. An example dataset and R code are provided. The bundle of methods is referred to as seasonality, mediation and comparison (SMAC). The case study described utilizes lung function as the marker observed on a cystic fibrosis cohort but SMAC can be used to evaluate other markers and in other disease contexts. Key aspects of customization are as follows.\u2022This study introduces a novel seasonality model to fit trajectories of lung function decline and demonstrates how to compare this model to a conventional model in this context.\u2022Steps required for mediation analyses in the seasonality model are shown.\u2022The necessary calculations to compare seasonality models between cohorts, based on estimation coefficients, are derived in the study.",

        "Abstract": "Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) encourages clinicians to seek the most reputable evidence. The quality of evidence is organized in a hierarchy in which randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as least biased. However, RCTs are plagued by poor generalizability, impeding the translation of clinical research to practice. Though the presence of poor external validity is known, the factors that contribute to poor generalizability have not been summarized and placed in a framework. We propose a new population-oriented conceptual framework to facilitate consistent and comprehensive evaluation of generalizability, replicability, and assessment of RCT study quality.",

        "Abstract": "An increasing amount of evidence suggests ultrafine particles (UFPs) are linked to adverse health effects, especially in those with chronic conditions such as asthma, due to their small size and physicochemical characteristics. Toxicological and experimental studies have demonstrated these properties, and the mechanisms by which they deposit and translocate in the body result in increased toxicity in comparison to other air pollutants. However, current epidemiological literature is limited due to exposure misclassification and thus identifying health outcomes associated with UFPs. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between weekly personal UFP exposure with lung function and respiratory symptoms in 117 asthmatic and non-asthmatic adolescents between 13 and 17\u00a0years of age in the Cincinnati area. Between 2017 and 2019, participants collected weekly UFP concentrations by sampling for 3\u00a0h a day in their home, school, and during transit. In addition, pulmonary function was evaluated at the end of the sampling week, and respiratory symptoms were logged on a mobile phone application. Multivariable linear regression and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) models were used to estimate the association between personal UFP and respiratory outcomes. The average median weekly UFP exposure of all participants was 4340 particles/cm",

        "Abstract": "Parvimonas micra is an anaerobic, fastidious, gram positive organism commonly found in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. It has been increasingly reported as the cause of septic arthritis of native joints, often times with delayed diagnosis leading to increased morbidity. Risk factors include immunosuppression, inflammation of the joint, and recent dental procedures or infections. It has been a historically difficult organism to culture. However, the development of and increasing use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) has led to increased identification of P.\u00a0micra. Common antibiotic susceptibilities, as well as data regarding susceptibilities in specific situations, have been reported, but susceptibility testing is required in all cases. Common treatments include clindamycin, penicillin, and metronidazole for six to ten weeks.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding place-based contributors to health requires geographically and culturally diverse study populations, but sharing location data is a significant challenge to multisite studies. Here, we describe a standardized and reproducible method to perform geospatial analyses for multisite studies. Using census tract-level information, we created software for geocoding and geospatial data linkage that was distributed to a consortium of birth cohorts located throughout the USA. Individual sites performed geospatial linkages and returned tract-level information for 8810 children to a central site for analyses. Our generalizable approach demonstrates the feasibility of geospatial analyses across study sites to promote collaborative translational research.",

        "Abstract": "Phenotyping algorithms are essential tools for conducting clinical research on observational data. Manually devel- oped phenotyping algorithms, such as those curated within the eMERGE (electronic Medical Records and Genomics) Network, represent the gold standard but are time consuming to create. In this work, we propose a framework for learning from the structure of eMERGE phenotype concept sets to assist construction of novel phenotype definitions. We use eMERGE phenotypes as a source of reference concept sets and engineer rich features characterizing the con- cept pairs within each set. We treat these pairwise relationships as edges in a concept graph, train models to perform edge prediction, and identify candidate phenotype concept sets as highly connected subgraphs. Candidate concept sets may then be interrogated and composed to construct novel phenotype definitions.",

        "Abstract": "Multi-center observational studies require recognition and reconciliation of differences in patient representations arising from underlying populations, disparate coding practices and specifics of data capture. This leads to different granularity or detail of concepts representing the clinical facts. For researchers studying certain populations of interest, it is important to ensure that concepts at the right level are used for the definition of these populations. We studied the granularity of concepts within 22 data sources in the OHDSI network and calculated a composite granularity score for each dataset. Three alternative SNOMED-based approaches for such score showed consistency in classifying data sources into three levels of granularity (low, moderate and high), which correlated with the provenance of data and country of origin. However, they performed unsatisfactorily in ordering data sources within these groups and showed inconsistency for small data sources. Further studies on examining approaches to data source granularity are needed.",

Our study included 2.6 and 0.46 million users of alpha-1 blockers and of alternative BPH therapy during the period between November 2019 and January 2020, found in electronic health records from Spain (SIDIAP) and the United States (Department of Veterans Affairs, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, IQVIA OpenClaims, Optum DOD, Optum EHR). We estimated hazard ratios using state-of-the-art techniques to minimize potential confounding, including large-scale propensity score matching/stratification and negative control calibration. We found no differential risk for any of COVID-19 outcome, pointing to the need for further research on potential COVID-19 therapies.",

        "Abstract": "The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in China demonstrated at an early stage the high rate of moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the patient population. An intervention that has proved beneficial is the use of prone positioning (PP) for mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS. In one institution, PP was practiced in the medical ICU for this population. However, with the dramatically increasing patient load, staff anticipated that greater capacity to provide this treatment to all qualifying patients would be required.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is straining health care systems globally. The burden on hospitals during the pandemic could be reduced by implementing prediction models that can discriminate patients who require hospitalization from those who do not. The COVID-19 vulnerability (C-19) index, a model that predicts which patients will be admitted to hospital for treatment of pneumonia or pneumonia proxies, has been developed and proposed as a valuable tool for decision-making during the pandemic. However, the model is at high risk of bias according to the \"prediction model risk of bias assessment\" criteria, and it has not been externally validated.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this analysis was to examine and compare quantitative metrics of observed dampness and mold, including visible mold and moisture damage, and fungal and bacterial microbiomes. In-home visits were conducted at age 7 for children enrolled in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study. Trained study staff evaluated the primary residence and measured total areas of visible moisture and mold damage in the home. Floor dust was collected and archived. Archived dust samples collected from each home (n = 178) were extracted and analyzed using bacterial (16S rRNA gene) and fungal (internal transcribed spacer region) sequencing. Fungi were also divided into moisture requirement categories of xerophiles, mesophiles, and hydrophiles. Data analyses used Spearman's correlation, Kruskal-Wallis, Permanova, DESeq, and negative binomial regression models. Comparing high moisture or mold damage to no damage, five fungal species and two bacterial species had higher concentrations (absolute abundance) and six fungal species and three bacterial species had lower concentrations. Hydrophilic and mesophilic fungi showed significant dose-related increases with increasing moisture damage and mold damage, respectively. When comparing alpha or beta diversity of fungi and bacteria across mold and moisture damage levels, no significant associations or differences were found. Mold and moisture damage did not affect diversity of fungal and bacterial microbiomes. Instead, both kinds of damage were associated with changes in species composition of both bacterial and fungal microbiomes, indicating that fungal and bacterial communities in the home might be influenced by one another as well as by mold or moisture in the home.",

        "Abstract": "Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites relies on primary metabolic pathways to provide precursors, energy, and cofactors, thus requiring coordinated regulation of primary and secondary metabolic networks. However, to date, it remains largely unknown how this coordination is achieved. Using Petunia hybrida flowers, which emit high levels of phenylpropanoid/benzenoid volatile organic compounds (VOCs), we uncovered genome-wide dynamic deposition of histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) during anthesis as an underlying mechanism to coordinate primary and secondary metabolic networks. The observed epigenome reprogramming is accompanied by transcriptional activation at gene loci involved in primary metabolic pathways that provide precursor phenylalanine, as well as secondary metabolic pathways to produce volatile compounds. We also observed transcriptional repression among genes involved in alternative phenylpropanoid branches that compete for metabolic precursors. We show that GNAT family histone acetyltransferase(s) (HATs) are required for the expression of genes involved in VOC biosynthesis and emission, by using chemical inhibitors of HATs, and by knocking down a specific HAT gene, ELP3, through transient RNAi. Together, our study supports that regulatory mechanisms at chromatin level may play an essential role in activating primary and secondary metabolic pathways to regulate VOC synthesis in petunia flowers.",

One key decision is how to include patients who are lost to follow-up. In this paper we perform a large-scale empirical evaluation investigating the impact of this decision.

        "Abstract": "Many observational studies explore the association between acetaminophen and cancer, but known limitations such as vulnerability to channeling, protopathic bias, and uncontrolled confounding hamper the interpretability of results. To help understand the potential magnitude of bias, we identify key design choices in these observational studies and specify 10 study design variants that represent different combinations of these design choices. We evaluate these variants by applying them to 37 negative controls - outcome presumed not to be caused by acetaminophen - as well as 4 cancer outcomes in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database. The estimated odds and hazards ratios for the negative controls show substantial bias in the evaluated design variants, with far fewer of the 95% confidence intervals containing 1 than the nominal 95% expected for negative controls. The effect-size estimates for the cancer outcomes are comparable to those observed for the negative controls. A comparison of exposed and unexposed reveals many differences at baseline for which most studies do not correct. We observe that the design choices made in many of the published observational studies can lead to substantial bias. Thus, caution in the interpretation of published studies of acetaminophen and cancer is recommended.",

        "Abstract": "Healthcare professionals increasingly rely on observational healthcare data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, to estimate the causal effects of interventions. However, limited prior studies raise concerns about the real-world performance of the statistical and epidemiological methods that are used. We present the \"OHDSI Methods Benchmark\" that aims to evaluate the performance of effect estimation methods on real data. The benchmark comprises a gold standard, a set of metrics, and a set of open source software tools. The gold standard is a collection of real negative controls (drug-outcome pairs where no causal effect appears to exist) and synthetic positive controls (drug-outcome pairs that augment negative controls with simulated causal effects). We apply the benchmark using four large healthcare databases to evaluate methods commonly used in practice: the new-user cohort, self-controlled cohort, case-control, case-crossover, and self-controlled case series designs. The results confirm the concerns about these methods, showing that for most methods the operating characteristics deviate considerably from nominal levels. For example, in most contexts, only half of the 95% confidence intervals we calculated contain the corresponding true effect size. We previously developed an \"empirical calibration\" procedure to restore these characteristics and we also evaluate this procedure. While no one method dominates, self-controlled methods such as the empirically calibrated self-controlled case series perform well across a wide range of scenarios.",

        "Abstract": "There is paucity of literature on dietary treatment in glycogen storage disease (GSD) type IV and formal guidelines are not available. Traditionally, liver transplantation was considered the only treatment option for GSD IV. In light of the success of dietary treatment for the other hepatic forms of GSD, we have initiated this observational study to assess the outcomes of medical diets, which limit the accumulation of glycogen. Clinical, dietary, laboratory, and imaging data for 15 GSD IV patients from three centres are presented. Medical diets may have the potential to delay or prevent liver transplantation, improve growth and normalize serum aminotransferases. Individual care plans aim to avoid both hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia and/or hyperketosis, to minimize glycogen accumulation and catabolism, respectively. Multidisciplinary monitoring includes balancing between traditional markers of metabolic control (ie, growth, liver size, serum aminotransferases, glucose homeostasis, lactate, and ketones), liver function (ie, synthesis, bile flow and detoxification of protein), and symptoms and signs of portal hypertension.",

Despite this complexity, single pathway or even single protein activations are commonly used to extrapolate broad characterizations of cellular metabolism. Furthermore, multiple routes for peptide-chain translation initiation exist, some of which may be either exclusive or overlapping depending on the state and environment of the cell. While it may be highly impractical to account for every aspect of metabolic regulation and permutation of mRNA translation, it is important to acknowledge that investigations relating to these pathways are often incomplete and not necessarily indicative of the overall metabolic status. This becomes urgent when considering the role that cellular anabolism plays in both healthy cellular functions and the aetiology of several disease's altered metabolisms. This review describes recent advances in the understanding of cellular metabolic regulation, with specific focus given to the complexity of 'downstream' mRNA translation initiation through both mTOR-dependent and mTOR-independent signallings.",

        "Abstract": "Early identification of symptoms and comorbidities most predictive of COVID-19 is critical to identify infection, guide policies to effectively contain the pandemic, and improve health systems' response. Here, we characterised socio-demographics and comorbidity in 3,316,107persons tested and 219,072 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 since January 2020, and their key health outcomes in the month following the first positive test. Routine care data from primary care electronic health records (EHR) from Spain, hospital EHR from the United States (US), and claims data from South Korea and the US were used. The majority of study participants were women aged 18-65 years old. Positive/tested ratio varied greatly geographically (2.2:100 to 31.2:100) and over time (from 50:100 in February-April to 6.8:100 in May-June). Fever, cough and dyspnoea were the most common symptoms at presentation. Between 4%-38% required admission and 1-10.5% died within a month from their first positive test. Observed disparity in testing practices led to variable baseline characteristics and outcomes, both nationally (US) and internationally. Our findings highlight the importance of large scale characterization of COVID-19 international cohorts to inform planning and resource allocation including testing as countries face a second wave.",

        "Abstract": "Comorbid conditions appear to be common among individuals hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but estimates of prevalence vary and little is known about the prior medication use of patients. Here, we describe the characteristics of adults hospitalised with COVID-19 and compare them with influenza patients. We include 34,128 (US: 8362, South Korea: 7341, Spain: 18,425) COVID-19 patients, summarising between 4811 and 11,643 unique aggregate characteristics. COVID-19 patients have been majority male in the US and Spain, but predominantly female in South Korea. Age profiles vary across data sources. Compared to 84,585 individuals hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19, COVID-19 patients have more typically been male, younger, and with fewer comorbidities and lower medication use. While protecting groups vulnerable to influenza is likely a useful starting point in the response to COVID-19, strategies will likely need to be broadened to reflect the particular characteristics of individuals being hospitalised with COVID-19.",

        "Abstract": "Respiratory microbiome is an understudied area of research compared to other microbiomes of the human body. The respiratory tract is exposed to an array of environmental pollutants, including microbes. Yet, we know very little about the relationship between environmental and respiratory microbiome. The primary aim of our study was to compare the mycobiomes and bacteriomes between three sample types from the same participants, including home dust, saliva, and sputum. Samples were collected from 40 adolescents in a longitudinal cohort. We analyzed the samples using 16s bacterial rDNA and ITS fungal rDNA gene sequencing, as well as quantitative PCR with universal fungal and bacterial primers. Results showed that home dust had the greatest alpha diversity between the three sample types for both bacteria and fungi. Dust had the highest total fungal load and the lowest total bacterial load. Sputum had greater bacterial diversity than saliva, but saliva had greater fungal diversity than sputum. The distribution of major bacterial phyla differed between all sample types. However, the distribution of major fungal classes differed only between sputum and saliva. Future research should examine the biological significance of the taxa found in each sample type based on microbial ecology and associations with health effects.",

        "Abstract": "The use of antipsychotic medications (APMs) could be different among countries due to availability, approved indications, characteristics and clinical practice. However, there is limited literature providing comparisons of APMs use among countries. To examine trends in antipsychotic prescribing in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States, we conducted a cross-national study from 2002 to 2014\u00a0b\u00a0y using the distributed network approach with common data model. We included all patients who had at least a record of antipsychotic prescription in this study, and defined patients without previous exposure of antipsychotics for 6 months before the index date as new users for incidence estimation. We calculated the incidence, prevalence, and prescription rate of each medication by calendar year. Among older patients, sulpiride was the most incident [incidence rate (IR) 11.0-23.3) and prevalent [prevalence rate (PR) 11.9-14.3) APM in Taiwan, and most prevalent (PR 2.5-3.9) in Japan. Quetiapine and haloperidol were most common in the United States (IR 8.1-9.5; PR 18.0-18.4) and Hong Kong (PR 8.8-13.7; PR 10.6-12.7), respectively. The trend of quetiapine use was increasing in Taiwan, Hong Kong and the United States. As compared to older patients, the younger patients had more propensity to be prescribed second-generation APM for treatment in four countries. Trends in antipsychotic prescribing varied among countries. Quetiapine use was most prevalent in the United States and increasing in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The increasing use of quetiapine in the elderly patients might be due to its safety profile compared to other APMs.",

        "Abstract": "The Society for Vascular Surgery Alternative Payment Model (APM) Taskforce document explores the drivers and implications for developing objective value-based reimbursement plans for the care of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The APM is a payment approach that highlights high-quality and cost-efficient care and is a financially incentivized pathway for participation in the Quality Payment Program, which aims to replace the traditional fee-for-service payment method. At present, the participation of vascular specialists in APMs is hampered owing to the absence of dedicated models. The increasing prevalence of PAD diagnosis, technological advances in therapeutic devices, and the increasing cost of care of the affected patients have financial consequences on care delivery models and population health. The document summarizes the existing measurement methods of cost, care processes, and outcomes using payor data, patient-reported outcomes, and registry participation. The document also evaluates the existing challenges in the evaluation of PAD care, including intervention overuse, treatment disparities, varied clinical presentations, and the effects of multiple comorbid conditions on the cost potentially attributable to the vascular interventionalist. Medicare reimbursement data analysis also confirmed the prolonged need for additional healthcare services after vascular interventions. The Society for Vascular Surgery proposes that a PAD APM should provide patients with comprehensive care using a longitudinal approach with integration of multiple key medical and surgical services. It should maintain appropriate access to diagnostic and therapeutic advancements and eliminate unnecessary interventions. It should also decrease the variability in care but must also consider the varying complexity of the presenting PAD conditions. Enhanced quality of care and physician innovation should be rewarded. In addition, provisions should be present within an APM for high-risk patients who carry the risk of exclusion from care because of the naturally associated high costs. Although the document demonstrates clear opportunities for quality improvement and cost savings in PAD care, continued PAD APM development requires the assessment of more granular data for accurate risk adjustment, in addition to largescale testing before public release. Collaboration between payors and physician specialty societies remains key.",

        "Abstract": "Evidence derived from existing health-care data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, can fill evidence gaps in medicine. However, many claim such data cannot be used to estimate causal treatment effects because of the potential for observational study bias; for example, due to residual confounding. Other concerns include P hacking and publication bias. In response, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics international collaborative launched the Large-scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation across a Network of Databases (LEGEND) research initiative. Its mission is to generate evidence on the effects of medical interventions using observational health-care databases while addressing the aforementioned concerns by following a recently proposed paradigm. We define 10 principles of LEGEND that enshrine this new paradigm, prescribing the generation and dissemination of evidence on many research questions at once; for example, comparing all treatments for a disease for many outcomes, thus preventing publication bias. These questions are answered using a prespecified and systematic approach, avoiding P hacking. Best-practice statistical methods address measured confounding, and control questions (research questions where the answer is known) quantify potential residual bias. Finally, the evidence is generated in a network of databases to assess consistency by sharing open-source analytics code to enhance transparency and reproducibility, but without sharing patient-level information. Here we detail the LEGEND principles and provide a generic overview of a LEGEND study. Our companion paper highlights an example study on the effects of hypertension treatments, and evaluates the internal and external validity of the evidence we generate.",

        "Abstract": "The U.S. healthcare system is undergoing a broad transformation from the traditional fee-for-service model to value-based payments. The changes introduced by the Medicare Quality Payment Program, including the establishment of Alternative Payment Models, ensure that the practice of vascular surgery is likely to face significant reimbursement changes as payments transition to favor these models. The Society for Vascular Surgery Alternative Payment Model taskforce was formed to explore the opportunities to develop a physician-focused payment model that will allow vascular surgeons to continue to deliver the complex care required for peripheral arterial disease (PAD).",

        "Title": "Comparative safety and effectiveness of alendronate versus raloxifene in women with osteoporosis.",
        "Abstract": "Alendronate and raloxifene are among the most popular anti-osteoporosis medications. However, there is a lack of head-to-head comparative effectiveness studies comparing the two treatments. We conducted a retrospective large-scale multicenter study encompassing over 300 million patients across nine databases encoded in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). The primary outcome was the incidence of osteoporotic hip fracture, while secondary outcomes were vertebral fracture, atypical femoral fracture (AFF), osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), and esophageal cancer. We used propensity score trimming and stratification based on an expansive propensity score model with all pre-treatment patient characteritistcs. We accounted for unmeasured confounding using negative control outcomes to estimate and adjust for residual systematic bias in each data source. We identified 283,586 alendronate patients and 40,463 raloxifene patients. There were 7.48 hip fracture, 8.18 vertebral fracture, 1.14 AFF, 0.21 esophageal cancer and 0.09 ONJ events per 1,000 person-years in the alendronate cohort and 6.62, 7.36, 0.69, 0.22 and 0.06 events per 1,000 person-years, respectively, in the raloxifene cohort. Alendronate and raloxifene have a similar hip fracture risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94-1.13), but alendronate users are more likely to have vertebral fractures (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14). Alendronate has higher risk for AFF (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.23-1.84) but similar risk for esophageal cancer (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.53-1.70), and ONJ (HR 1.62, 95% CI 0.78-3.34). We demonstrated substantial control of measured confounding by propensity score adjustment, and minimal residual systematic bias through negative control experiments, lending credibility to our effect estimates. Raloxifene is as effective as alendronate and may remain an option in the prevention of osteoporotic fracture.",

        "Abstract": "Background In this study we phenotyped individuals hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in depth, summarising entire medical histories, including medications, as captured in routinely collected data drawn from databases across three continents. We then compared individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 to those previously hospitalised with influenza. Methods We report demographics, previously recorded conditions and medication use of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the US (Columbia University Irving Medical Center [CUIMC], Premier Healthcare Database [PHD], UCHealth System Health Data Compass Database [UC HDC], and the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA OMOP]), in South Korea (Health Insurance Review & Assessment [HIRA]), and Spain (The Information System for Research in Primary Care [SIDIAP] and HM Hospitales [HM]). These patients were then compared with patients hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19. Results 34,128 (US: 8,362, South Korea: 7,341, Spain: 18,425) individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 were included. Between 4,811 (HM) and 11,643 (CUIMC) unique aggregate characteristics were extracted per patient, with all summarised in an accompanying interactive website (http://evidence.ohdsi.org/Covid19CharacterizationHospitalization/). Patients were majority male in the US (CUIMC: 52%, PHD: 52%, UC HDC: 54%, VA OMOP: 94%,) and Spain (SIDIAP: 54%, HM: 60%), but were predominantly female in South Korea (HIRA: 60%). Age profiles varied across data sources. Prevalence of asthma ranged from 4% to 15%, diabetes from 13% to 43%, and hypertensive disorder from 24% to 70% across data sources. Between 14% and 33% were taking drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system in the 30 days prior to hospitalisation. Compared to 81,596 individuals hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19, patients admitted with COVID-19 were more typically male, younger, and healthier, with fewer comorbidities and lower medication use. Conclusions We provide a detailed characterisation of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Protecting groups known to be vulnerable to influenza is a useful starting point to minimize the number of hospital admissions needed for COVID-19. However, such strategies will also likely need to be broadened so as to reflect the particular characteristics of individuals hospitalised with COVID-19.",

The objective of this study was to qualitatively explore how young adults interpret these hashtags on the popular platform Instagram. Specifically, we sought to identify if they view these hashtags as making health-related claims, and if they find these claims to be credible and valid. We conducted 12 focus groups in 2018 with non-tobacco users, smokers, dual users, and vapers between the ages of 18 and 24 (",

        "Abstract": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as the most reputable source of evidence. In some studies, factors beyond the intervention itself may contribute to the measured effect, an occurrence known as heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). If the RCT population differs from the real-world population on factors that induce HTE, the trials effect will not replicate. The RCTs eligibility criteria should identify the sub-population in which its evidence will replicate. However, the extent to which the eligibility criteria identify the appropriate population is unknown, which raises concerns for generalizability. We compared reported data from RCTs with real-world data from the electronic health records of a large, academic medical center that was curated according to RCT eligibility criteria. Our results show fundamental differences between the RCT population and our observational cohorts, which suggests that eligibility criteria may be insufficient for identifying the applicable real-world population in which RCT evidence will replicate.",

        "Abstract": "African ancestry is associated with a higher prevalence and greater severity of asthma than European ancestries, yet genetic studies of the most common locus associated with childhood-onset asthma, 17q12-21, in African Americans have been inconclusive. The aim of this study was to leverage both the phenotyping of the Children's Respiratory and Environmental Workgroup (CREW) birth cohort consortium, and the reduced linkage disequilibrium in African Americans, to fine map the 17q12-21 locus.",

        "Abstract": "Although anatomical research clearly demonstrates the ability of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system to independently influence cardiac function, little research has examined whether coordinated activation is typical or whether the extent of autonomic coordination is situationally dependent. This study examines the extent of coordination between sympathetic (cardiac pre-ejection period: PEP) and parasympathetic (respiratory sinus arrhythmia: RSA) influences on the cardiac function to determine whether coordination is a trait-like between-person characteristic or a state-varying within-person phenomenon, and if so, whether variability in autonomic coordination is modulated by cognitive (P3b amplitude) or affective state. Kindergarten-aged children (n\u00a0=\u00a0257) completed a go/no-go task administered in blocks designed to induce affective states through the delivery of reward (Blocks 1 and 3) and frustration (Block 2). Results from multilevel models that allowed for the simultaneous examination of between-person and within-person associations in the repeated measures data suggested that (a) children with higher overall RSA also tended to have higher overall PEP; (b) at within-person level, RSA and PEP tended to be reciprocally coordinated; but that (c) when frustration invokes cognitive disengagement, coordination between parasympathetic and sympathetic systems demonstrate compensatory coordination. These findings highlight the extent to which the coordination of autonomic systems is a dynamic state-like phenomenon rather than a trait-like individual differences characteristic.",

        "Abstract": "Early life exposure to air pollution poses a significant risk to brain development from direct exposure to toxicants or via indirect mechanisms involving the circulatory, pulmonary or gastrointestinal systems. In children, exposure to traffic related air pollution has been associated with adverse effects on cognitive, behavioral and psychomotor development. We aimed to determine whether childhood exposure to traffic related air pollution is associated with regional differences in brain volume and cortical thickness among children enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study of traffic related air pollution and child health. We used magnetic resonance imaging to obtain anatomical brain images from a nested subset of 12 year old participants characterized with either high or low levels of traffic related air pollution exposure during their first year of life. We employed voxel-based morphometry to examine group differences in regional brain volume, and with separate analyses, changes in cortical thickness. Smaller regional gray matter volumes were determined in the left pre- and post-central gyri, the cerebellum, and inferior parietal lobe of participants in the high traffic related air pollution exposure group relative to participants with low exposure. Reduced cortical thickness was observed in participants with high exposure relative to those with low exposure, primarily in sensorimotor regions of the brain including the pre- and post-central gyri and the paracentral lobule, but also within the frontal and limbic regions. These results suggest that significant childhood exposure to traffic related air pollution is associated with structural alterations in brain.",

        "Abstract": "Greenness such as trees, plants, and shrubs may positively influence mental and physical health, but the relationship between greenness and asthma is poorly understood. Because asthma is the most prevalent child respiratory disease internationally, elucidating the role of greenness may substantially benefit public health. The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize findings related to effects of greenness on asthma in children. Following PRISMA guidelines, six databases were searched for international publication of primary research results relevant to the relationship between greenness and child asthma. Of 82 initial results, seven articles remained after removal of duplicates and applying exclusion criteria. Six reported no direct association between greenness and child asthma, while one found increased greenness protective for asthma. None found a negative direct association between greenness and child asthma. Evidence supported benefits of greenness on child asthma through mediation of factors such as exposure to tobacco smoke, high traffic volume, and difficult family relationships. Even without a direct association, greenness can be considered a public health asset as it may mediate other factors contributing to asthma in children. Public health nurses can use these findings to educate clients and partners while advocating for policies to protect greenness.",

        "Title": "Adapting electronic health records-derived phenotypes to claims data: Lessons learned in using limited clinical data for phenotyping.",
        "Abstract": "Algorithms for identifying patients of interest from observational data must address missing and inaccurate data and are desired to achieve comparable performance on both administrative claims and electronic health records data. However, administrative claims data do not contain the necessary information to develop accurate algorithms for disorders that require laboratory results, and this omission can result in insensitive diagnostic code-based algorithms. In this paper, we tested our assertion that the performance of a diagnosis code-based algorithm for chronic kidney disorder (CKD) can be improved by adding other codes indirectly related to CKD (e.g., codes for dialysis, kidney transplant, suspicious kidney disorders). Following the best practices from Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), we adapted an electronic health record-based gold standard algorithm for CKD and then created algorithms that can be executed on administrative claims data and account for related data quality issues. We externally validated our algorithms on four electronic health record datasets in the OHDSI network. Compared to the algorithm that uses CKD diagnostic codes only, positive predictive value of the algorithms that use additional codes was slightly increased (47.4% vs. 47.9-48.5% respectively). The algorithms adapted from the gold standard algorithm can be used to infer chronic kidney disorder based on administrative claims data. We succeeded in improving the generalizability and consistency of the CKD phenotypes by using data and vocabulary standardized across the OHDSI network, although performance variability across datasets remains. We showed that identifying and addressing coding and data heterogeneity can improve the performance of the algorithms.",

        "Abstract": "Traffic-related airborne particles are associated with asthma morbidity. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration on the concentrations of traffic particles and the resultant effect on children with asthma. Forty-three children with asthma were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. A HEPA air cleaner or a placebo \"dummy\" was placed in participants' homes for four weeks, interrupted by a one-month washout period, before crossing over to the other treatment arm for four weeks. Air sampling and health outcomes, including asthma control (ACQ) and quality of life (AQLQ) measures, were completed prior to and at the end of each treatment arm. Indoor concentrations of traffic particles were significantly reduced with the HEPA treatment but not with the \"dummy\" treatment. In participants with poorly controlled asthma and lower quality of life at baseline, ACQ and AQLQ scores were significantly improved (1.3 to 0.9, P\u00a0=\u00a0.003 and 4.9 to 5.5, P\u00a0=\u00a0.02, respectively) following the HEPA treatment. In this study, HEPA filtration is associated with improved clinical outcomes and quality of life measures in children with uncontrolled asthma.",

This laboratory has shown that bovine growth hormone (bGH) also has a catalytic function, i.e. peptidylglycine monooxygenase activity, which is the first step in the alpha-amidation of glycine-extended peptides. We report here that the peptidylglycine monooxygenase activity of monomeric bovine pituitary GH, in the presence of ascorbate, is stimulated by combination with oligomeric forms of bGH one of which is a hetero-oligomer with metallothionein. Three species of recombinant monomeric GH (bovine, human and chicken) also catalyze this monooxygenase reaction. Tetrahydrobiopterin also functions as a reductant - with a significantly greater turnover than achieved with ascorbate. These findings clarify the role of GH in peptidylglycine monooxygenation and provide an explanation for earlier observations that peptide amidation is not totally obliterated in the absence of ascorbate, in cultured pituitary cells or ",

The landscape of systemic therapy has recently changed, with six additional systemic agents either approved or awaiting approval for advanced stage HCC. While these agents have the potential to improve outcomes, a survival increase of 2-5 months remains poor and falls short of what has been achieved in many other solid tumor types. The roles of genomics, underlying cirrhosis, and optimal use of treatment strategies that include radiation, liver transplantation, and surgery remain unanswered. Here, we discuss new treatment opportunities, controversies, and future directions in managing HCC.",

        "Abstract": "The case-control design is widely used in retrospective database studies, often leading to spectacular findings. However, results of these studies often cannot be replicated, and the advantage of this design over others is questionable. To demonstrate the shortcomings of applications of this design, we replicate two published case-control studies. The first investigates isotretinoin and ulcerative colitis using a simple case-control design. The second focuses on dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and acute pancreatitis, using a nested case-control design. We include large sets of negative control exposures (where the true odds ratio is believed to be 1) in both studies. Both replication studies produce effect size estimates consistent with the original studies, but also generate estimates for the negative control exposures showing substantial residual bias. In contrast, applying a self-controlled design to answer the same questions using the same data reveals far less bias. Although the case-control design in general is not at fault, its application in retrospective database studies, where all exposure and covariate data for the entire cohort are available, is unnecessary, as other alternatives such as cohort and self-controlled designs are available. Moreover, by focusing on cases and controls it opens the door to inappropriate comparisons between exposure groups, leading to confounding for which the design has few options to adjust for. We argue that this design should no longer be used in these types of data. At the very least, negative control exposures should be used to prove that the concerns raised here do not apply.",

        "Title": "Cornstarch requirements of the adult glycogen storage disease Ia population: A retrospective review.",
        "Abstract": "Cornstarch has been the primary treatment for glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD Ia) for over 35\u2009years. When cornstarch was first described as a treatment, few people survived beyond early childhood. As the prognosis for this population has improved, the need to ensure appropriate cornstarch dosing for different age groups has become imperative. Records from 115 patients (10-62\u2009years of age) with GSD Ia evaluated at our center between 2015 and 2017 were reviewed. Data collected included weight, age, genetic mutation, amount and frequency of cornstarch doses, body mass index, gender, 24-hour glucose and lactate concentrations, and biochemical markers of metabolic control. The data demonstrate that adult treatment needs vary greatly from younger age groups, and the required cornstarch support decreases with age (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The required number of doses, however, did not change with a mean of six doses (range 4-8) daily in all age groups. General laboratory findings across time demonstrate that significantly reducing the amount of starch required to maintain euglycemia with aging can be done without sacrificing metabolic control. Carbohydrate requirements decrease with aging, and older patients were found to require less cornstarch. Failure to lower the cornstarch doses contributes to over-treatment in adults with GSD Ia. Not only does this lead to worsening hepatomegaly and excessive weight gain, but over-treatment contributes to relative hyperinsulinism and rebound hypoglycemia. This knowledge is essential in designing nutritional therapies for the aging GSD population.",

The Children's Respiratory and Environmental Workgroup (CREW) was established to integrate multiple established asthma birth cohorts and to investigate asthma phenotypes and associated causal pathways (endotypes), focusing on how they are influenced by interactions between genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures during the prenatal period and early childhood.",

        "Abstract": "Epidemiologic studies have found air pollution to be causally linked to respiratory health including the exacerbation and development of childhood asthma. Accurately characterizing exposure is paramount in these studies to ensure valid estimates of health effects. Here, we provide a brief overview of the evolution of air pollution exposure assessment ranging from the use of ground-based, single-site air monitoring stations for population-level estimates to recent advances in spatiotemporal models, which use advanced machine learning algorithms and satellite-based data to accurately estimate individual-level daily exposures at high spatial resolutions. In addition, we review recent advances in sensor technology that enable the use of personal monitoring in epidemiologic studies, long-considered the \"holy grail\" of air pollution exposure assessment. Finally, we highlight key advantages and uses of each approach including the generalizability and public health relevance of air pollution models and the accuracy of personal monitors that are useful to guide personalized prevention strategies. Investigators and clinicians interested in the effects of air pollution on allergic disease and asthma should carefully consider the pros and cons of each approach to guide their application in research and practice.",

        "Title": "Using high-resolution residential greenspace measures in an urban environment to assess risks of allergy outcomes in children.",
        "Abstract": "Despite reported health benefits of urban greenspace (gs), the epidemiological evidence is less clear for allergic disease. To address a limitation of previous research, we examined the associations of medium- and high-resolution residential gs measures and tree and/or grass canopies with allergic outcomes for children enrolled in the longitudinal cincinnati childhood allergy and air pollution study (ccaaps). We estimated residential gs based on 400\u202fm radial buffers around participant addresses (n\u202f=\u202f478) using the normalized differential vegetation index (ndvi) and land cover-derived urban greenspace (ugs) (tree and grass coverage, combined and separate) at 30\u202fm and 1.5-2.5\u202fm resolution, respectively. Associations between outdoor aeroallergen sensitization and allergic rhinitis at age 7 and residential gs measures at different exposure windows were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. A 10% increase in ugs-derived grass coverage was associated with an increased risk of sensitization to grass pollens (adjusted odds ratio [aor]: 1.27; 95% confidence interval\u202f=\u202f1.02-1.58). For each 10% increase in ugs-derived tree canopy coverage, nonstatistically significant decreased odds were found for grass pollen sensitization, tree pollen sensitization, and sensitization to either (aor range\u202f=\u202f0.87-0.94). Results similar in magnitude to ugs-tree canopy coverage were detected for ndvi and allergic sensitizations. High-resolution (down to 1.5\u202fm) gs measures of grass- and tree-covered areas showed associations in opposite directions for different allergy outcomes. These data suggest that measures strongly correlated with tree canopy (e.g., ndvi) may be insufficient to detect health effects associated with proximity to different types of vegetation or help elucidate mechanisms related to specific gs exposure pathways.",

        "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies have linked both traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) and noise to adverse health outcomes, including increased blood pressure, myocardial infarction, and respiratory health. The high correlation between these environmental exposures and their measurement challenges have constrained research on how simultaneous exposure to TRAP and traffic noise interact and possibly enhance each other's effect. The objective of this study was to deploy two novel personal sensors for measuring ultrafine particles (UFP, <100 nm diameter) and noise to concurrently monitor real-time exposures. Personal UFP monitors (PUFP, Enmont, LLC) were paired with NEATVIBEwear\u2122 (Noise Exposure, Activity-Time and Vibration wearable), a personal noise monitoring device developed by the authors (Douglas Leaffer, Steve Doroff). A field-test of PUFP monitors co-deployed with NEATVIBEwear logged UFP, noise and ambient temperature exposure levels at 1-s resolution in an adolescent population in Cincinnati, OH to measure real-time exposures in microenvironments (transit, home, school). Preliminary results show that the concurrent measurement of noise exposures with UFP is feasible in a sample of physically active adolescent participants. Personal measurements of UFP and noise, measured prospectively in future studies, will enable researchers to investigate the independent and/or joint-effects of these health-relevant environmental exposures.",

However, vapor-phase organic carbon (OC) can be adsorbed in the filters, interfering with total carbon results. This study presents a comparative evaluation between the submicron fraction of DPM concentrations corrected for the adsorption of the vapor-phase OC (dynamic blank), and the respirable fraction of DPM corrected for a field blank.

        "Abstract": "Variants of the DRD2 Taq1A polymorphism, which have been shown to result in functional differences in dopamine D2 receptors (D2R), have been linked to various externalizing outcomes in adults. However, the neurobiological processes that contribute to these associations are not well understood. The current study investigates gene\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0environment effects on teacher-rated externalizing behaviors and probabilistic decision making in a sample of 333 children (age 9) enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal study. Findings indicate that externalizing behaviors increased as a function of hypoxic exposure only among individuals carrying the A1 (A1+) allele. Results also indicate that willingness to pursue reward under conditions of maximum uncertainty (50% probability) decreased as a function of hypoxic exposure only among A1- individuals. Among A1 carriers, no association between probability decision making and hypoxic exposure emerged. These findings suggest that hypoxia could influence neural development through different biological pathways depending on D2 receptor genotype, and provide insight into the development of individual differences in behavior and decision making.",

        "Abstract": "In many eukaryotes, translation initiation is regulated by proteins that bind to the mRNA cap-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). These proteins commonly prevent association of eIF4E with eIF4G or form repressive messenger ribonucleoproteins that exclude the translation machinery. Such gene-regulatory mechanisms in plants, and even the presence of eIF4E-interacting proteins other than eIF4G (and the plant-specific isoform eIFiso4G, which binds eIFiso4E), are unknown. Here, we report the discovery of a plant-specific protein, conserved binding of eIF4E 1 (CBE1). We found that CBE1 has an evolutionarily conserved eIF4E-binding motif in its N-terminal domain and binds eIF4E or eIFiso4E ",

Patients with PTD have treatment-resistant depression (TRD) if they do not benefit from \u2265 2 AD medications taken with reasonable compliance for adequate durations at adequate doses. Some database studies of TRD do not assess AD medication dose and would, therefore, overestimate TRD incidence unless physicians treating PTD patients routinely prescribe AD medications at adequate doses before changing medications.",

        "Abstract": "Concerns over reproducibility in science extend to research using existing healthcare data; many observational studies investigating the same topic produce conflicting results, even when using the same data. To address this problem, we propose a paradigm shift. The current paradigm centres on generating one estimate at a time using a unique study design with unknown reliability and publishing (or not) one estimate at a time. The new paradigm advocates for high-throughput observational studies using consistent and standardized methods, allowing evaluation, calibration and unbiased dissemination to generate a more reliable and complete evidence base. We demonstrate this new paradigm by comparing all depression treatments for a set of outcomes, producing 17\u2009718 hazard ratios, each using methodology on par with current best practice. We furthermore include control hypotheses to evaluate and calibrate our evidence generation process. Results show good transitivity and consistency between databases, and agree with four out of the five findings from clinical trials. The distribution of effect size estimates reported in the literature reveals an absence of small or null effects, with a sharp cut-off at ",

        "Abstract": "Observational healthcare data, such as electronic health records and administrative claims, offer potential to estimate effects of medical products at scale. Observational studies have often been found to be nonreproducible, however, generating conflicting results even when using the same database to answer the same question. One source of discrepancies is error, both random caused by sampling variability and systematic (for example, because of confounding, selection bias, and measurement error). Only random error is typically quantified but converges to zero as databases become larger, whereas systematic error persists independent from sample size and therefore, increases in relative importance. Negative controls are exposure-outcome pairs, where one believes no causal effect exists; they can be used to detect multiple sources of systematic error, but interpreting their results is not always straightforward. Previously, we have shown that an empirical null distribution can be derived from a sample of negative controls and used to calibrate ",

        "Abstract": "Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) develops in acute decompensation (AD) of cirrhosis and shows high mortality. In critically ill patients, early diagnosis of ACLF could be important for therapeutic decisions (eg, renal replacement, artificial liver support, liver transplantation). This study evaluated fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) as a marker of mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of ACLF. The study included 154 individuals (112 critically patients and 42 healthy controls) divided into a training and a validation cohort. In the training cohort of 42 healthy controls and 34 critically ill patients (of whom 24 were patients with cirrhosis), levels of FGF21, interleukin (IL) 6, and IL8 were measured. In the validation cohort of 78 patients with cirrhosis, 17 patients were admitted with or developed ACLF during follow-up and underwent daily clinical and nutritional assessment. Levels of FGF21 were higher in critically ill patients, especially in patients with cirrhosis admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, FGF21 as well as IL6 and IL8 levels were higher in patients with ACLF, but they did not increase with the severity of ACLF. Interestingly, in the validation cohort, FGF21 was also elevated in the patients who developed ACLF in the next 7 days. In these patients, FGF21 levels were an independent predictor of ACLF presence and development in multivariate analysis together with Child-Pugh score. FGF21 levels had no impact on the survival of critically ill patients with cirrhosis. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that FGF21 levels are of specific diagnostic value regarding the presence and development of ACLF in patients admitted to ICU for AD of liver cirrhosis. Further studies are warranted to address pathophysiological and possible therapeutic implications. Liver Transplantation 24 595-605 2018 AASLD.",

        "Title": "Inferring pregnancy episodes and outcomes within a network of observational databases.",
        "Abstract": "Administrative claims and electronic health records are valuable resources for evaluating pharmaceutical effects during pregnancy. However, direct measures of gestational age are generally not available. Establishing a reliable approach to infer the duration and outcome of a pregnancy could improve pharmacovigilance activities. We developed and applied an algorithm to define pregnancy episodes in four observational databases: three US-based claims databases: Truven MarketScan\u00ae Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE), Truven MarketScan\u00ae Multi-state Medicaid (MDCD), and the Optum ClinFormatics\u00ae (Optum) database and one non-US database, the United Kingdom (UK) based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Pregnancy outcomes were classified as live births, stillbirths, abortions and ectopic pregnancies. Start dates were estimated using a derived hierarchy of available pregnancy markers, including records such as last menstrual period and nuchal ultrasound dates. Validation included clinical adjudication of 700 electronic Optum and CPRD pregnancy episode profiles to assess the operating characteristics of the algorithm, and a comparison of the algorithm's Optum pregnancy start estimates to starts based on dates of assisted conception procedures. Distributions of pregnancy outcome types were similar across all four data sources and pregnancy episode lengths found were as expected for all outcomes, excepting term lengths in episodes that used amenorrhea and urine pregnancy tests for start estimation. Validation survey results found highest agreement between reviewer chosen and algorithm operating characteristics for questions assessing pregnancy status and accuracy of outcome category with 99-100% agreement for Optum and CPRD. Outcome date agreement within seven days in either direction ranged from 95-100%, while start date agreement within seven days in either direction ranged from 90-97%. In Optum validation sensitivity analysis, a total of 73% of algorithm estimated starts for live births were in agreement with fertility procedure estimated starts within two weeks in either direction; ectopic pregnancy 77%, stillbirth 47%, and abortion 36%. An algorithm to infer live birth and ectopic pregnancy episodes and outcomes can be applied to multiple observational databases with acceptable accuracy for further epidemiologic research. Less accuracy was found for start date estimations in stillbirth and abortion outcomes in our sensitivity analysis, which may be expected given the nature of the outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "What is the central question of this study? Translocation of nNOS\u03bc initiates catabolic signalling via FoxO3a and skeletal muscle atrophy during mechanical unloading. Recent evidence suggests that unloading-induced muscle atrophy and FoxO3a activation are redox sensitive. Will a mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase (i.e. Eukarion-134) also mitigate suppression of the Akt-mTOR pathway? What is the main finding and its importance? Eukarion-134 rescued Akt-mTOR signalling and sarcolemmal nNOS\u03bc, which were linked to protection against the unloading phenotype, muscle fibre atrophy and partial fibre-type shift from slow to fast twitch. The loss of nNOS\u03bc from the sarcolemma appears crucial to Akt phosphorylation and is redox sensitive, although the mechanisms remain unresolved.",

        "Abstract": "Personalised medicine, new discoveries and studies on rare exposures or outcomes require large samples that are increasingly difficult for any single investigator to obtain. Collaborative work is limited by heterogeneities, both what is being collected and how it is defined. To develop a core set for data collection in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) research which (1) allows harmonisation of data collection in future observational studies, (2) acts as a common data model against which existing databases can be mapped and (3) serves as a template for standardised data collection in routine clinical practice to support generation of research-quality data. A multistep, international multistakeholder consensus process was carried out involving voting via online surveys and two face-to-face meetings. A core set of 21 items ('what to collect') and their instruments ('how to collect') was agreed: age, gender, disease duration, diagnosis of RA, body mass index, smoking, swollen/tender joints, patient/evaluator global, pain, quality of life, function, composite scores, acute phase reactants, serology, structural damage, treatment and comorbidities. The core set should facilitate collaborative research, allow for comparisons across studies and harmonise future data from clinical practice via electronic medical record systems.",

        "Abstract": "We explored how drug switching impacts adherence measures for common chronic oral medications. Switching between ingredients with the same indication was detected within a 30-day grace period. The proportion of days covered (PDC) and adherent status (cutoff 0.8) for each ingredient was calculated and compared between different censoring approaches: censoring drug switching (PDCswitch), censoring the end of dispensing (PDCend), and fixed 365-day period (PDC365). Overall, 854,380 (15.9%) patients in the Optum ClinFormatics (Optum) and 150,785 (22.0%) patients in the MarketScan Multi-state Medicaid (MDCD) had at least one switch within one year. Compared with PDC365 in Optum, PDCswitch means were higher: 0.85 vs. 0.41 for antihypertensive, 0.82 vs. 0.46 for antihyperglycemics, and 0.84 vs. 0.33 for antihyerlipidemia. Further, the percentages of adherent patients were higher: 95.8% vs. 17.9% for antihypertensive, 85.5% vs. 18.9% for antihyperglycemics, and 72.1% vs. 5.3% for antihyerlipidemia. Significant and modest changes were observed between PDCswitch and PDCend.",

        "Abstract": "Exposure assessment for elemental components of particulate matter (PM) using land use modeling is a complex problem due to the high spatial and temporal variations in pollutant concentrations at the local scale. Land use regression (LUR) models may fail to capture complex interactions and non-linear relationships between pollutant concentrations and land use variables. The increasing availability of big spatial data and machine learning methods present an opportunity for improvement in PM exposure assessment models. In this manuscript, our objective was to develop a novel land use random forest (LURF) model and compare its accuracy and precision to a LUR model for elemental components of PM in the urban city of Cincinnati, Ohio.

        "Abstract": "Prediction of medical events, such as clinical procedures, is essential for preventing disease, understanding disease mechanism, and increasing patient quality of care. Although longitudinal clinical data from Electronic Health Records provides opportunities to develop predictive models, the use of these data faces significant challenges. Primarily, while the data are longitudinal and represent thousands of conceptual events having duration, they are also sparse, complicating the application of traditional analysis approaches. Furthermore, the framework presented here takes advantage of the events duration and gaps. International standards for electronic healthcare data represent data elements, such as procedures, conditions, and drug exposures, using eras, or time intervals. Such eras contain both an event and a duration and enable the application of time intervals mining - a relatively new subfield of data mining. In this study, we present Maitreya, a framework for time intervals analytics in longitudinal clinical data. Maitreya discovers frequent time intervals related patterns (TIRPs), which we use as prognostic markers for modelling clinical events. We introduce three novel TIRP metrics that are normalized versions of the horizontal-support, that represents the number of TIRP instances per patient. We evaluate Maitreya on 28 frequent and clinically important procedures, using the three novel TIRP representation metrics in comparison to no temporal representation and previous TIRPs metrics. We also evaluate the epsilon value that makes Allen's relations more flexible with several settings of 30, 60, 90 and 180days in comparison to the default zero. For twenty-two of these procedures, the use of temporal patterns as predictors was superior to non-temporal features, and the use of the vertically normalized horizontal support metric to represent TIRPs as features was most effective. The use of the epsilon value with thirty days was slightly better than the zero.",

ORV use in geographic regions with naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) and erionite (NOE) may result in the liberation of these minerals from underlying rocks and soil, which may put ORV participants at risk to potentially hazardous inhalation exposures.",

        "Abstract": "In localities with combined sewer systems, combined sewer overflow (CSO) events frequently occur following high precipitation and can result in the release of untreated sewage and industrial wastewater into surface waters. We hypothesized that either direct contact with or proximity to aerosolized CSO effluent would increase the risk for childhood emergency department (ED) visits for asthma, gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses, and skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in Cincinnati, OH, USA. ED visits for 2010-2014 due to GI diseases, asthma, and SSTIs were extracted from the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center electronic health records. The location and timing of CSO events were obtained from the Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) of Greater Cincinnati. ED visits with a residential address within 500m of a CSO site were used in a case-control crossover study with two bi-directional control periods. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk of an ED visit associated with a CSO event at lag periods of 0 to 7days. Statistically significant elevated risks for GI-related ED visits was observed two (OR: 1.16 [95% CI 1.04,1.30]) days after CSO events. CSO events were not significantly associated with asthma- or SSTI-related ED visits, but show similar trends. Our findings suggest an increased risk for GI-related ED visits following CSO events among children who reside near CSO sites.",

        "Abstract": "Recent adverse event reports have raised the question of increased angioedema risk associated with exposure to levetiracetam. To help address this question, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics research network conducted a retrospective observational new-user cohort study of seizure patients exposed to levetiracetam (n = 276,665) across 10 databases. With phenytoin users (n = 74,682) as a comparator group, propensity score-matching was conducted and hazard ratios computed for angioedema events by per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses. Angioedema events were rare in both the levetiracetam and phenytoin groups (54 vs. 71 in per-protocol and 248 vs. 435 in intent-to-treat). No significant increase in angioedema risk with levetiracetam was seen in any individual database (hazard ratios ranging from 0.43 to 1.31). Meta-analysis showed a summary hazard ratio of 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-1.31) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.52-0.79) for the per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses, respectively. The results suggest that levetiracetam has the same or lower risk for angioedema than phenytoin, which does not currently carry a labeled warning for angioedema. Further studies are warranted to evaluate angioedema risk across all antiepileptic drugs.",

        "Abstract": "Health disparities, which can be understood as disadvantages in health associated with one's social, racial, economic, or physical environment, originate in childhood and persist across an individual's life course. One's neighborhood may drive or influence these disparities. Information on neighborhoods that can characterize their risks-what we call place-based risks-is rarely used in patient care. Community-level data, however, could inform and personalize interventions such as arranging for mold removal from the home of a person with asthma from the moment that person's address is recorded at the site of care. Efficient risk identification could lead to the tailoring of recommendations and targeting of resources, to improve care experiences and clinical outcomes while reducing disparities and costs. In this article we highlight how data on place-based social determinants of health from national and local sources could be incorporated more directly into patient-centered care, adding precision to risk assessment and mitigation. We also discuss how this information could stimulate cross-sector interventions that promote health equity: the attainment of the highest level of health for neighborhoods, patient panels, and individuals. Finally, we draw attention to research questions that focus on the role of geographical place at the bedside.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical trials often lack power to identify rare adverse drug events (ADEs) and therefore cannot address the threat rare ADEs pose, motivating the need for new ADE detection techniques. Emerging national patient claims and electronic health record databases have inspired post-approval early detection methods like the Bayesian self-controlled case series (BSCCS) regression model. Existing BSCCS models do not account for multiple outcomes, where pathology may be shared across different ADEs. We integrate a pathology hierarchy into the BSCCS model by developing a novel informative hierarchical prior linking outcome-specific effects. Considering shared pathology drastically increases the dimensionality of the already massive models in this field. We develop an efficient method for coping with the dimensionality expansion by reducing the hierarchical model to a form amenable to existing tools. Through a synthetic study we demonstrate decreased bias in risk estimates for drugs when using conditions with different true risk and unequal prevalence. We also examine observational data from the MarketScan Lab Results dataset, exposing the bias that results from aggregating outcomes, as previously employed to estimate risk trends of warfarin and dabigatran for intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding. We further investigate the limits of our approach by using extremely rare conditions. This research demonstrates that analyzing multiple outcomes simultaneously is feasible at scale and beneficial.",

        "Title": "Parental Snoring and Environmental Pollutants, but Not Aeroallergen Sensitization, Are Associated with Childhood Snoring in a Birth Cohort.",
        "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine whether atopy and other clinical and environmental variables predict the risk of childhood habitual snoring (HS) in a birth cohort born to atopic parents. Participants completed clinical evaluations and questionnaires at ages 1-4 and age 7. HS was defined as snoring \u22653 nights/week. Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure was estimated using land-use regression. The association between early (\u2264age 4) and current (age 7) allergic disease, environmental exposures, and snoring at age 7 was examined using adjusted logistic regression. Of the 609 children analyzed the prevalence of HS at age 7 was 21%. Early tobacco smoke exposure [environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)] [odds ratio (OR) 1.79, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.12-2.84], rhinitis (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.06-2.92), wheezing (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.05-2.53), maternal HS (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.36-3.18), and paternal HS (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.14-3.00) were significantly associated with HS at age 7. Current TRAP (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.13-3.26), respiratory infections (OR 1.16, 95% 1.03-1.35), maternal HS (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.69-4.84), and paternal HS (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.82-5.09) were significantly associated with HS at age 7. To our knowledge, this is the largest birth cohort examining longitudinal predictors of snoring in children born to atopic parents. Parental HS was the only variable consistently associated with childhood HS from ages 1 to 7. Early rhinitis, early ETS exposure, and concurrent traffic pollution exposure increased the risk of HS at age 7, while aeroallergen sensitization did not. Children with these characteristics should be considered for screening of sleep disorders.",

        "Abstract": "The transcription factors LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1), together with the AP1 paralog CAULIFLOWER (CAL), control the onset of flower development in a partially redundant manner. This redundancy is thought to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of a shared set of target genes. However, whether these genes are independently or cooperatively regulated by LFY and AP1/CAL is currently unknown. To better understand the regulatory relationship between LFY and AP1/CAL and to obtain deeper insights into the control of floral initiation, we monitored the activity of LFY in the absence of AP1/CAL function. We found that the regulation of several known LFY target genes is unaffected by AP1/CAL perturbation, while others appear to require AP1/CAL activity. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that LFY and AP1/CAL control the expression of some genes in an antagonistic manner. Notably, these include key regulators of floral initiation such as ",

        "Abstract": "Pathogenic variants in PHOX2B lead to congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), a rare disorder of the nervous system characterized by autonomic dysregulation and hypoventilation typically presenting in the neonatal period, although a milder late-onset (LO) presentation has been reported. More than 90% of cases are caused by polyalanine repeat mutations (PARMs) in the C-terminus of the protein; however non-polyalanine repeat mutations (NPARMs) have been reported. Most NPARMs are located in exon 3 of PHOX2B and result in a more severe clinical presentation including Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) and/or peripheral neuroblastic tumors (PNTs). A previously reported nonsense pathogenic variant in exon 1 of a patient with LO-CCHS and no HSCR or PNTs leads to translational reinitiation at a downstream AUG codon producing an N-terminally truncated protein. Here we report additional individuals with nonsense pathogenic variants in exon 1 of PHOX2B. In vitro analyses were used to determine if these and other reported nonsense variants in PHOX2B exon 1 produced N-terminally truncated proteins. We found that all tested nonsense variants in PHOX2B exon 1 produced a truncated protein of the same size. This truncated protein localized to the nucleus and transactivated a target promoter. These data suggest that nonsense pathogenic variants in the first exon of PHOX2B likely escape nonsense mediated decay (NMD) and produce N-terminally truncated proteins functionally distinct from those produced by the more common PARMs.",

        "Abstract": "Integrating multiple sources of pharmacovigilance evidence has the potential to advance the science of safety signal detection and evaluation. In this regard, there is a need for more research on how to integrate multiple disparate evidence sources while making the evidence computable from a knowledge representation perspective (i.e., semantic enrichment). Existing frameworks suggest well-promising outcomes for such integration but employ a rather limited number of sources. In particular, none have been specifically designed to support both regulatory and clinical use cases, nor have any been designed to add new resources and use cases through an open architecture.

        "Abstract": "Due to their capacity to self-renew, proliferate and generate multi-lineage cells, adult-derived stem cells offer great potential for use in regenerative therapies to stop and/or reverse degenerative diseases such as diabetes, heart failure, Alzheimer's disease and others. However, these subsets of cells can be isolated from different niches, each with differing potential for therapeutic applications. The stromal vascular fraction (SVF), a stem cell enriched and adipose-derived cell population, has garnered interest as a therapeutic in regenerative medicine due to its ability to secrete paracrine factors that accelerate endogenous repair, ease of accessibility and lack of identified major adverse effects. Thus, one can easily understand the rush to employ adipose-derived SVF to treat human disease. Perhaps faster than any other cell preparation, SVF is making its way to clinics worldwide, while critical preclinical research needed to establish SVF safety, efficacy and optimal, standardized clinical procedures are underway. Here, we will provide an overview of the current knowledge driving this phenomenon, its regulatory issues and existing studies, and propose potential unmapped applications.

Participants were 31 registered forum users and 10 forum moderators. Findings were based on content analysis of 238 messages posted across 28 distinct discussion threads over 12 consecutive months. Nine different types of interaction were identified. In each case the function of the interaction was identified (e.g., to relay personal experiences or solicit opinions of others) and illustrated using quotations from the data set. Online discussion forums that are facilitated by trained moderators offer a safe space for young people to disclose personal information and express their emotions in respect of romantic relationship breakup. Online interactions are rich in empathy and peer support is evident among visitors to such forums.",

        "Abstract": "The use of fluorescent proteins fused to other proteins has been very useful in revealing the location and function of many proteins. However, it is very important to show that the fusion of these reporter proteins does not impact the function of the protein of interest. Plants have 2 forms of the cap-binding protein that function in initiation of translation, eIF4E and a plant specific form, eIFiso4E. In an attempt to determine the cellular localization of eIFiso4E, fusions to GFP were made, but were found to not be competent to rescue the lethal phenotype of plants lacking eIF4E and eIFiso4E. This suggested that the GFP fusions at either the N- or C-terminus of eIFiso4E were not functional. Biochemical analysis of the fusions revealed that eIFiso4E\u2022GFP fusions were not able to bind to m",

        "Abstract": "Exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) has been implicated in asthma development, persistence, and exacerbation. This exposure is highly significant as large segments of the global population resides in zones that are most impacted by TRAP and schools are often located in high TRAP exposure areas. Recent findings shed new light on the epigenetic mechanisms by which exposure to traffic pollution may contribute to the development and persistence of asthma. In order to delineate TRAP induced effects on the epigenome, utilization of newly available innovative methods to assess and quantify traffic pollution will be needed to accurately quantify exposure. This review will summarize the most recent findings in each of these areas. Although there is considerable evidence that TRAP plays a role in asthma, heterogeneity in both the definitions of TRAP exposure and asthma outcomes has led to confusion in the field. Novel information regarding molecular characterization of asthma phenotypes, TRAP exposure assessment methods, and epigenetics are revolutionizing the field. Application of these new findings will accelerate the field and the development of new strategies for interventions to combat TRAP-induced asthma.",

We propose a multi-trait metric - GIST 2.0 that can compute the a priori generalizability based on the population representativeness of a clinical study by explicitly modeling the dependencies among all eligibility criteria. We evaluate this metric on twenty clinical studies of two diseases and analyze how a study's eligibility criteria affect its generalizability (collectively and individually). We statistically analyze the effects of trial setting, trait selection and trait summarizing technique on GIST 2.0. Finally we provide theoretical as well as empirical validations for the expected properties of GIST 2.0.",

        "Abstract": "Pre-emptive pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing of a panel of genes may be easier to implement and more cost-effective than reactive pharmacogenomic testing if a sufficient number of medications are covered by a single test and future medication exposure can be anticipated. We analysed the incidence of exposure of individual patients in the United States to multiple drugs for which pharmacogenomic guidelines are available (PGx drugs) within a selected four-year period (2009-2012) in order to identify and quantify the incidence of pharmacotherapy in a nation-wide patient population that could be impacted by pre-emptive PGx testing based on currently available clinical guidelines. In total, 73 024 095 patient records from private insurance, Medicare Supplemental and Medicaid were included. Patients enrolled in Medicare Supplemental age > = 65 or Medicaid age 40-64 had the highest incidence of PGx drug use, with approximately half of the patients receiving at least one PGx drug during the 4 year period and one fourth to one third of patients receiving two or more PGx drugs. These data suggest that exposure to multiple PGx drugs is common and that it may be beneficial to implement wide-scale pre-emptive genomic testing. Future work should therefore concentrate on investigating the cost-effectiveness of multiplexed pre-emptive testing strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Randomized controlled trials can benefit from proactive assessment of how well their participant selection strategies during the design of eligibility criteria can influence the study generalizability. In this paper, we present a quantitative metric called generalizability index for study traits 2.0 (GIST 2.0) to assess the a priori generalizability (based on population representativeness) of a clinical trial by accounting for the dependencies among multiple eligibility criteria. The metric was evaluated on 16 sepsis trials identified from ClinicalTrials.gov, with their adverse event reports extracted from the trial results sections. The correlation between GIST scores and adverse events was analyzed. We found that the GIST 2.0 score was significantly correlated with total adverse events and serious adverse events (weighted correlation coefficients of 0.825 and 0.709, respectively, with P < 0.01). This study exemplifies the promising use of Big Data in electronic health records and ClinicalTrials.gov for optimizing eligibility criteria design for clinical studies.",

        "Abstract": "Observational research promises to complement experimental research by providing large, diverse populations that would be infeasible for an experiment. Observational research can test its own clinical hypotheses, and observational studies also can contribute to the design of experiments and inform the generalizability of experimental research. Understanding the diversity of populations and the variance in care is one component. In this study, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) collaboration created an international data network with 11 data sources from four countries, including electronic health records and administrative claims data on 250 million patients. All data were mapped to common data standards, patient privacy was maintained by using a distributed model, and results were aggregated centrally. Treatment pathways were elucidated for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and depression. The pathways revealed that the world is moving toward more consistent therapy over time across diseases and across locations, but significant heterogeneity remains among sources, pointing to challenges in generalizing clinical trial results. Diabetes favored a single first-line medication, metformin, to a much greater extent than hypertension or depression. About 10% of diabetes and depression patients and almost 25% of hypertension patients followed a treatment pathway that was unique within the cohort. Aside from factors such as sample size and underlying population (academic medical center versus general population), electronic health records data and administrative claims data revealed similar results. Large-scale international observational research is feasible.",

        "Abstract": "Identification of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) during the post-marketing phase is one of the most important goals of drug safety surveillance. Spontaneous reporting systems (SRS) data, which are the mainstay of traditional drug safety surveillance, are used for hypothesis generation and to validate the newer approaches. The publicly available US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data requires substantial curation before they can be used appropriately, and applying different strategies for data cleaning and normalization can have material impact on analysis results. We provide a curated and standardized version of FAERS removing duplicate case records, applying standardized vocabularies with drug names mapped to RxNorm concepts and outcomes mapped to SNOMED-CT concepts, and pre-computed summary statistics about drug-outcome relationships for general consumption. This publicly available resource, along with the source code, will accelerate drug safety research by reducing the amount of time spent performing data management on the source FAERS reports, improving the quality of the underlying data, and enabling standardized analyses using common vocabularies.",

        "Abstract": "To efficiently counteract pathogens, plants rely on a complex set of immune responses that are tightly regulated to allow the timely activation, appropriate duration and adequate amplitude of defense programs. The coordination of the plant immune response is known to require the activity of the ubiquitin/proteasome system, which controls the stability of proteins in eukaryotes. Here, we demonstrate that the N-end rule pathway, a subset of the ubiquitin/proteasome system, regulates the defense against a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that this pathway positively regulates the biosynthesis of plant-defense metabolites such as glucosinolates, as well as the biosynthesis and response to the phytohormone jasmonic acid, which plays a key role in plant immunity. Our results also suggest that the arginylation branch of the N-end rule pathway regulates the timing and amplitude of the defense program against the model pathogen Pseudomonas syringae AvrRpm1.",

        "Abstract": "Epidemiologic studies commonly use residential locations to estimate environmental exposures or community-level characteristics. The impact of residential mobility on these characteristics, however, is rarely considered. The objective of this analysis was to examine the effect of residential mobility on estimates of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), greenspace, and community-level characteristics. All residential addresses were reported from birth through age seven for children enrolled in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study. Exposure to TRAP at each address was estimated using a land use model. Greenspace was estimated using satellite imagery. Indices of neighborhood deprivation and race were created based on socioeconomic-census tract measures. Exposure estimates using the birth record address, the last known address, and the annual address history were used to determine exposure estimation error and bias in the association with asthma at age seven. Overall, 54% of the cohort moved at least once prior to age seven. Each move was separated by a median of 4 miles and associated with a median decrease of 4.4% in TRAP exposure, a 5.3% increase in greenspace, an improved deprivation index, and no change in the race index. Using the birth record address or the last known address instead of the annual address history resulted in exposure misclassification leading to a bias toward the null when associating the exposures with asthma. Using a single address to estimate environmental exposures and community-level characteristics over a time period may result in differential assessment error.",

        "Title": "Indoor air quality in green-renovated vs. non-green low-income homes of children living in a temperate region of US (Ohio).",
        "Abstract": "Green eco-friendly housing includes approaches to reduce indoor air pollutant sources and to increase energy efficiency. Although sealing/tightening buildings can save energy and reduce the penetration of outdoor pollutants, an adverse outcome can be increased buildup of pollutants with indoor sources. The objective of this study was to determine the differences in the indoor air quality (IAQ) between green and non-green homes in low-income housing complexes. In one housing complex, apartments were renovated using green principles (n=28). Home visits were conducted immediately after the renovation, and subsequently at 6 months and at 12 months following the renovation. Of these homes, eight homes had pre-renovation home visits; this allowed pre- and post-renovation comparisons within the same homes. Parallel visits were conducted in non-green (control) apartments (n=14) in a nearby low-income housing complex. The IAQ assessments included PM2.5, black carbon, ultrafine particles, sulfur, total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde, and air exchange rate. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. None of the indoor pollutant concentrations were significantly different between green and non-green homes. However, we found differences when comparing the concentrations before and after renovation. Measured immediately after renovation, indoor black carbon concentrations were significantly lower averaging 682 ng/m(3) in post-renovation vs. 2364 ng/m(3) in pre-renovation home visits (p=0.01). In contrast, formaldehyde concentrations were significantly higher in post-renovated (0.03 ppm) than in pre-renovated homes (0.01 ppm) (p=0.004). Questionnaire data showed that opening of windows occurred less frequently in homes immediately post-renovation compared to pre-renovation; this factor likely affected the levels of indoor black carbon (from outdoor sources) and formaldehyde (from indoor sources) more than the renovation status itself. To reduce IAQ problems and potentially improve health, careful selection of indoor building materials and ensuring sufficient ventilation are important for green building designs.",

        "Title": "Analysis of Personal and Home Characteristics Associated with the Elemental Composition of PM2.5 in Indoor, Outdoor, and Personal Air in the RIOPA Study.",
        "Abstract": "The complex mixture of chemicals and elements that constitute particulate matter (PM*) varies by season and geographic location because source contributors differ over time and place. The composition of PM having an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) is hypothesized to be responsible, in part, for its toxicity. Epidemiologic studies have identified specific components and sources of PM2.5 that are associated with adverse health outcomes. The majority of these studies use measures of outdoor concentrations obtained from one or a few central monitoring sites as a surrogate for measures of personal exposure. Personal PM2.5 (and its elemental composition), however, may be different from the PM2.5 measured at stationary outdoor sites. The objectives of this study were (1) to describe the relationships between the concentrations of various elements in indoor, outdoor, and personal PM2.5 samples, (2) to identify groups of individuals with similar exposures to mixtures of elements in personal PM2.5 and to examine personal and home characteristics of these groups, and (3) to evaluate whether concentrations of elements from outdoor PM2.5 samples are appropriate surrogates for personal exposure to PM2.5 and its elements and whether indoor PM2.5 concentrations and information about home characteristics improve the prediction of personal exposure. The objectives of the study were addressed using data collected as part of the Relationships of Indoor, Outdoor, and Personal Air (RIOPA) study. The RIOPA study has previously measured the mass concentrations of PM2.5 and its elemental constituents during 48-hour concurrent indoor, outdoor (directly outside the home), and personal samplings in three urban areas (Los Angeles, California; Houston, Texas; and Elizabeth, New Jersey). The resulting data and information about personal and home characteristics (including air-conditioning use, nearby emission sources, time spent indoors, census-tract geography, air-exchange rates, and other information) for each RIOPA participant were downloaded from the RIOPA study database. We performed three sets of analyses to address the study aims. First, we conducted descriptive analyses to describe the relationships between elemental concentrations in the concurrently gathered indoor, outdoor, and personal air samples. We assessed the correlation between personal exposure and indoor concentrations as well as personal exposure and outdoor concentrations of each element and calculated ratios between them. In addition, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) and calculated principal component scores (PCSs) to examine the heterogeneity of the elemental composition and then tested whether the mixture of elements in indoor, outdoor, and personal PM2.5 was significantly different within each study site and across study sites. Secondly, we performed model-based clustering analysis to group RIOPA participants with similar exposures to mixtures of elements in personal PM2.5. We examined the association between cluster membership and the concentrations of elements in indoor and outdoor PM2.5 samples and personal and home characteristics. Finally, we developed a series of linear regression models and random forest models to examine the association between personal exposure to elements in PM2.5 and (1) outdoor measurements, (2) outdoor and indoor measurements, and (3) outdoor and indoor measurements and home characteristics. As we developed each model, the improvement in prediction of personal exposure when including additional information was assessed. Personal exposures to PM2.5 and to most elements were significantly correlated with both indoor and outdoor concentrations, although concentrations in personal samples frequently exceeded those of indoor and outdoor samples. In general, for most PM2.5 elements indoor concentrations were more highly correlated with personal exposure than were outdoor concentrations. PCA showed that the mixture of elements in indoor, outdoor, and personal PM2.5 varied significantly across sample types within each study site and also across study sites within each sample type. Using model-based clustering, we identified seven clusters of RIOPA participants whose personal PM2.5 samples had similar patterns of elemental composition. Using this approach, subsets of RIOPA participants were identified whose personal exposures to PM2.5 (and its elements) were significantly higher than their indoor and outdoor concentrations (and vice versa). The results of linear and random forest regression models were consistent with our correlation analyses and demonstrated that (1) indoor concentrations were more significantly associated with personal exposure than were outdoor concentrations and (2) participant reports of time spent at their home significantly modified many of the associations between indoor and personal concentrations. In linear regression models, the inclusion of indoor concentrations significantly improved the prediction of personal exposures to Ba, Ca, Cl, Cu, K, Sn, Sr, V, and Zn compared with the use of outdoor elemental concentrations alone. Including additional information on personal and home characteristics improved the prediction for only one element, Pb. Our results support the use of outdoor monitoring sites as surrogates of personal exposure for a limited number of individual elements associated with long-range transport and with a few local or indoor sources. Based on our PCA and clustering analyses, we concluded that the overall elemental composition of PM2.5 obtained at outdoor monitoring sites may not accurately represent the elemental composition of personal PM2.5. Although the data used in these analyses compared outdoor PM2.5 composition collected at the home with indoor and personal samples, our results imply that studies examining the complete elemental composition of PM2.5 should be cautious about using data from central outdoor monitoring sites because of the potential for exposure misclassification. The inclusion of personal and home characteristics only marginally improved the prediction of personal exposure for a small number of elements in PM2.5. We concluded that the additional cost and burden of indoor and personal sampling may be justified for studies examining elements because neither outdoor monitoring nor questionnaire data on home and personal characteristics were able to represent adequately the overall elemental composition of personal PM2.5.",

        "Abstract": "The historic developmental hourglass concept depicts the convergence of animal embryos to a common form during the phylotypic period. Recently, it has been shown that a transcriptomic hourglass is associated with this morphological pattern, consistent with the idea of underlying selective constraints due to intense molecular interactions during body plan establishment. Although plants do not exhibit a morphological hourglass during embryogenesis, a transcriptomic hourglass has nevertheless been identified in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana Here, we investigated whether plant hourglass patterns are also found postembryonically. We found that the two main phase changes during the life cycle of Arabidopsis, from embryonic to vegetative and from vegetative to reproductive development, are associated with transcriptomic hourglass patterns. In contrast, flower development, a process dominated by organ formation, is not. This suggests that plant hourglass patterns are decoupled from organogenesis and body plan establishment. Instead, they may reflect general transitions through organizational checkpoints.",

        "Abstract": "Asthma is a complex disorder influenced by genetics and the environment. Recent findings have linked abnormal DNA methylation in T cells with asthma; however, the potential dysregulation of methylation in airway epithelial cells is unknown. Studies of mouse models of asthma have observed greater levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) and ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) expression in lungs. TET proteins are known to catalyze methylation through modification of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hmC.",

The probe is a combination of graphite electrodes, filter paper, with ethylene glycol and choline chloride as the solvent/electrolyte. Square wave chromatovoltammograms show the probes have a sensitivity for TNT of 0.75 nA/ng and a limit of detection of 100 ng. In addition, by taking advantage of the inherent paper chromatography step, TNT can be separated in both time and cathodic peak potential from 4-amino-dinitrotolene co-spotted on the probe or in soil samples with the presence of methyl parathion as a possible interferent.",

        "Abstract": "Disease and damage from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) continually threaten the livelihood of agricultural producers and the economy in the United States, as well as challenge state and federal wildlife managers. Threats can be partially addressed by excluding free-ranging deer from livestock-related resources. Throughout the year, use of stored livestock feed by deer in northern Lower Michigan (MI), USA fluctuates, though their presence is relatively consistent. Since 2008, use of livestock areas and resources by deer has been reduced through intensive efforts by livestock producers in cooperation with state and federal agencies. These efforts focused on excluding deer from stored cattle feed in areas where deer were abundant. We monitored deer activity from Jan 2012 to June 2013 on 6 cattle farms in northern MI using GPS collars to evaluate behavioral effects of excluding deer from stored feed. We characterized areas deer occupied before and after installing 2361 m of fences and gates to exclude deer from stored cattle feed. Following fence installation, 9 deer previously accessing stored feed shifted to patterns of habitat use similar to 5 deer that did not use stored feed. However, continued attempts to regain access to stored feed were made at low frequencies, emphasizing the need to maintain the integrity of fences and keep gates closed for damage prevention and biosecurity.",

Although several studies have explored gene expression during flower development in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana on a genome-wide scale, a continuous series of expression data from the earliest floral stages until maturation has been lacking. Here, we used a floral induction system to close this information gap and to generate a reference dataset for stage-specific gene expression during flower formation.",

        "Abstract": "Distributed data networks representing large diverse populations are an expanding focus of drug safety research. However, interpreting results is difficult when treatment effect estimates vary across datasets (i.e., heterogeneity). In a previous study, risk estimates were generated for selected drugs and potential adverse outcomes. Analyses were replicated across eight distributed data sources using an identical analytic structure. To evaluate heterogeneity of risk estimates across data sources, the estimates were combined with summary-level data characterizing the population of each data source. Meta-analysis, meta-regression, and plots of the influence on overall results versus contribution to heterogeneity were examined and used to illustrate an approach to heterogeneity assessment. Heterogeneity, as measured by the I-squared statistic, was high with variability across outcomes. Plots of the relationship between influence on overall results and contribution to heterogeneity suggest that certain datasets and characteristics were influential but there was variability dependent on the drug and outcome being assessed. Exploratory meta-regression identified many possible influential factors, but may be subject to ecological bias and false positive conclusions. Distributed data network drug safety analyses can produce heterogeneous risk estimates that may not be easily explained. Approaches illustrated here can be useful for research that is subject to similar problems with heterogeneity.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding how flowers develop from undifferentiated stem cells has occupied developmental biologists for decades. Key to unraveling this process is a detailed knowledge of the global regulatory hierarchies that control developmental transitions, cell differentiation and organ growth. These hierarchies may be deduced from gene perturbation experiments, which determine the effects on gene expression after specific disruption of a regulatory gene. Here, we tested experimental strategies for gene perturbation experiments during Arabidopsis thaliana flower development. We used artificial miRNAs (amiRNAs) to disrupt the functions of key floral regulators, and expressed them under the control of various inducible promoter systems that are widely used in the plant research community. To be able to perform genome-wide experiments with stage-specific resolution using the various inducible promoter systems for gene perturbation experiments, we also generated a series of floral induction systems that allow collection of hundreds of synchronized floral buds from a single plant. Based on our results, we propose strategies for performing dynamic gene perturbation experiments in flowers, and outline how they may be combined with versions of the floral induction system to dissect the gene regulatory network underlying flower development.",

        "Abstract": "This report examines relapse risk following a switch from risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI) to another long-acting injectable antipsychotic [paliperidone palmitate (PP)] versus a switch to oral antipsychotics (APs). Truven Health's MarketScan Multistate Medicaid Database compared relapses following switches from RLAI. New user cohorts for these two groups were created on the basis of first incidence of exposure to the 'switched to' drug. Groups were balanced using 1:1 propensity score matching. Time-to-event analysis assessed schizophrenia-related hospital/emergency department visits. A total of 188 patients switched from RLAI to PP, and 131 patients switched from RLAI to oral AP. Propensity score-matched cohort included 109 patients who switched to PP and 109 patients who switched to an oral AP. Patients who switched from RLAI to PP had fewer events (26 vs. 32), longer time to an event (mean 70 vs. 47 days), and lower risk of relapse (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.92; P=0.024) compared with those who switched from RLAI to oral AP. Switching from RLAI to PP may be associated with a lower risk for relapse and longer duration of therapy compared with switching to oral AP. Given the limitations of observational studies, these results should be confirmed by other prospective evaluations.",

        "Abstract": "The Generalizability Index for Study Traits (GIST) has been proposed recently for assessing the population representativeness of a set of related clinical trials using eligibility features (e.g., age or BMI), one each time. However, GIST has not yet been evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this paper reports a simulation-based validation study for GIST. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, we demonstrated the effectiveness of GIST at quantifying the population representativeness of a set of related trials that differ in disease domains, study phases, sponsor types, and study designs, respectively. We also showed that among seven example medical conditions, the GIST of age increases from Phase I trials to Phase III trials in the seven disease domains and is the lowest in asthma trials. We concluded that GIST correlates with simulation-based generalizability results and is a valid metric for quantifying population representativeness of related clinical trials.",

        "Title": "Acute tongue swelling, the only initial manifestation of carotid artery dissection: a case report with differentiation of clinical picture.",
        "Abstract": "While it is well known that carotid artery dissection can cause hypoglossal palsy, which can cause muscle atrophy and fat tissue replacement in the chronic stage but what is less well known is the acute edematous stage, which can mimic tongue angioedema. We present a case report of a 52-year-old man presented to accident and emergency department with 3 hr history of right-side tongue swelling. He was initially diagnosed with angioedema and treated with corticosteroids and antihistamines. His tongue swelling persisted and subsequently developed unilateral weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the tongue, head, and neck revealed denervation of the right half of the tongue because of injury to hypoglossal nerve during extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection. There was no evidence of ischemic complication of right cerebral artery distribution. He was commenced on antiplatelet therapy to prevent cerebral ischemia as a prophylactic measure. Swelling and weakness of the tongue subsided in the following months. We believe that hypoglossal palsy caused by ICA dissection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with acute tongue swelling.",

        "Abstract": "The entire drug safety enterprise has a need to search, retrieve, evaluate, and synthesize scientific evidence more efficiently. This discovery and synthesis process would be greatly accelerated through access to a common framework that brings all relevant information sources together within a standardized structure. This presents an opportunity to establish an open-source community effort to develop a global knowledge base, one that brings together and standardizes all available information for all drugs and all health outcomes of interest (HOIs) from all electronic sources pertinent to drug safety. To make this vision a reality, we have established a workgroup within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, http://ohdsi.org) collaborative. The workgroup's mission is to develop an open-source standardized knowledge base for the effects of medical products and an efficient procedure for maintaining and expanding it. The knowledge base will make it simpler for practitioners to access, retrieve, and synthesize evidence so that they can reach a rigorous and accurate assessment of causal relationships between a given drug and HOI. Development of the knowledge base will proceed with the measureable goal of supporting an efficient and thorough evidence-based assessment of the effects of 1,000 active ingredients across 100 HOIs. This non-trivial task will result in a high-quality and generally applicable drug safety knowledge base. It will also yield a reference standard of drug-HOI pairs that will enable more advanced methodological research that empirically evaluates the performance of drug safety analysis methods.",

Researchers must understand their data source and whether outcomes, exposures and confounding factors are captured sufficiently to address the research question. They must also assess whether bias and confounding can be adequately minimized. Many study design characteristics may impact on the results; however, minimal if any sensitivity analyses are typically conducted, and those performed are post hoc. We propose pre-study steps for CER feasibility assessment and to identify sensitivity analyses that might be most important to pre-specify to help ensure that CER produces valid interpretable results.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate sex differences in proximate mechanisms that precede the termination of conflicts. In Study 1, we asked women and men to report their intensity of anger in response to hypothetical, common transgressions involving a same-sex roommate. Direct verbal and physical aggression elicited the highest-intensity anger for both sexes, although overall women reported more intense anger than men to all transgressions. In Study 2, we examined sex differences in subjective and physiological reactions to a conflict using a role-playing scenario. Following recall of a conflict involving direct aggression and role-playing a reaction to it, compared with men, women reported their anger would dissipate less quickly and they would take longer to reconcile. Women also exhibited increased heart rate, but little change in cortisol, whereas men exhibited little change in heart rate but increased cortisol production. We interpret the results as indicating that women are less prepared than men to resolve a conflict with a same-sex peer.",

        "Abstract": "Most approaches used in postmarketing drug safety monitoring, including spontaneous reporting and statistical risk identification using electronic health care records, are primarily suited to pick up only acute adverse drug effects. With the availability of increasingly larger electronic health record and administrative claims databases comes the opportunity to monitor for potential adverse effects that occur only after prolonged exposure to a drug, but analysis methods are lacking. We propose an adaptation of the self-controlled case series design that uses the notion of accumulated exposure to capture long-term effects of drugs and evaluate extensions to correct for age and recurrent events. Several variations of the approach are tested on simulated data and two large insurance claims databases. To evaluate performance a set of positive and negative control drug-event pairs was created by medical experts based on drug product labels and review of the literature. Performance on the real data was measured using the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve. The best performing method achieved an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve of 0.86 in the largest database using a spline model, adjustment for age, and ignoring recurrent events, but it appears this performance can only be achieved with very large data sets.",

        "Abstract": "Population-based birth cohorts on asthma and allergies increasingly provide new insights into the development and natural history of the diseases. More than 130 birth cohorts focusing on asthma and allergy have been initiated in the last 30 years. A National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Mechanisms of the Development of Allergy (MeDALL; Framework Programme 7 of the European Commission) joint workshop was held in Bethesda, Maryland, on September 11-12, 2012, with 3 objectives: (1) documenting the knowledge that asthma/allergy birth cohorts have provided, (2) identifying the knowledge gaps and inconsistencies, and (3) developing strategies for moving forward, including potential new study designs and the harmonization of existing asthma birth cohort data. The meeting was organized around the presentations of 5 distinct workgroups: (1) clinical phenotypes, (2) risk factors, (3) immune development of asthma and allergy, (4) pulmonary development, and (5) harmonization of existing birth cohorts. This article presents the workgroup reports and provides Web links (AsthmaBirthCohorts.niaid.nih.gov or www.medall-fp7.eu), where the reader will find tables describing the characteristics of the birth cohorts included in this report, the type of data collected at differing ages, and a selected bibliography provided by the participating birth cohorts.",

        "Title": "Two Arabidopsis loci encode novel eukaryotic initiation factor 4E isoforms that are functionally distinct from the conserved plant eukaryotic initiation factor 4E.",
        "Abstract": "Canonical translation initiation in eukaryotes begins with the Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, made up of eIF4E, which recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap of messenger RNA, and eIF4G, which serves as a scaffold to recruit other translation initiation factors that ultimately assemble the 80S ribosome. Many eukaryotes have secondary EIF4E genes with divergent properties. The model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) encodes two such genes in tandem loci on chromosome 1, EIF4E1B (At1g29550) and EIF4E1C (At1g29590). This work identifies EIF4E1B/EIF4E1C-type genes as a Brassicaceae-specific diverged form of EIF4E. There is little evidence for EIF4E1C gene expression; however, the EIF4E1B gene appears to be expressed at low levels in most tissues, though microarray and RNA Sequencing data support enrichment in reproductive tissue. Purified recombinant eIF4E1b and eIF4E1c proteins retain cap-binding ability and form functional complexes in vitro with eIF4G. The eIF4E1b/eIF4E1c-type proteins support translation in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) but promote translation initiation in vitro at a lower rate compared with eIF4E. Findings from surface plasmon resonance studies indicate that eIF4E1b and eIF4E1c are unlikely to bind eIF4G in vivo when in competition with eIF4E. This study concludes that eIF4E1b/eIF4E1c-type proteins, although bona fide cap-binding proteins, have divergent properties and, based on apparent limited tissue distribution in Arabidopsis, should be considered functionally distinct from the canonical plant eIF4E involved in translation initiation.",

        "Abstract": "Mental disorders account for six of the 20 leading causes of disability worldwide with a very high prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in youth aged 15-24 years. However, healthcare professionals are faced with many challenges in the identification and treatment of mental and substance use disorders in young people (e.g. young people's unwillingness to seek help from healthcare professionals, lack of training, limited resources etc.) The challenge of youth mental health for primary care is especially evident in urban deprived areas, where rates of and risk factors for mental health problems are especially common. There is an emerging consensus that primary care is well placed to address mental and substance use disorders in young people especially in deprived urban areas. This study aims to describe healthcare professionals' experience and attitudes towards screening and early intervention for mental and substance use disorders among young people (16-25 years) in primary care in deprived urban settings in Ireland.",

The panel consists of representatives from four teams leveraging electronic clinical data for CER, patient centered outcomes research (PCOR), and quality improvement (QI) and seeks to change the current paradigm where data quality assessment (DQA) is performed \"behind the scenes\" using one-off project specific methods. The panelists will present their process of harmonizing existing models for describing and measuring clinical data quality and will describe a comprehensive integrated framework for assessing and reporting DQA findings. The collaborative project is supported by the Electronic Data Methods (EDM) Forum, a three-year grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to facilitate learning and foster collaboration across a set of CER, PCOR, and QI projects designed to build infrastructure and methods for collecting and analyzing prospective data from electronic clinical data .",

However, the rates of drug exposure and outcome occurrences in observational databases, the database size and the desired risk detection threshold determine the power and therefore limit the feasibility of the application of appropriate analytical methods. Drugs vary dramatically for these parameters because of their prevalence of indication, cost, time on the market, payer formularies, market pressures and clinical guidelines.",

Recently, the Longitudinal Gamma Poisson Shrinker (LGPS) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Observational Profiles of Adverse events Related to Drugs (LEOPARD) methods were developed specifically for this task. LGPS applies Bayesian shrinkage to an estimated incidence rate ratio, and LEOPARD aims to detect and discard associations due to protopathic bias. The operating characteristics of these methods still need to be determined.",
