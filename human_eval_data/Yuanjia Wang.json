        "Abstract": "In this work, we propose methods to examine how the complex interrelationships between clinical symptoms and, separately, brain imaging biomarkers change over time leading up to the diagnosis of a disease in subjects with a known genetic near-certainty of disease. We propose a time-dependent undirected graphical model that ensures temporal and structural smoothness across time-specific networks to examine the trajectories of interactions between markers aligned at the time of disease onset. Specifically, we anchor subjects relative to the time of disease diagnosis (anchoring time) as in a revival process, and we estimate networks at each time point of interest relative to the anchoring time. To use all available data, we apply kernel weights to borrow information across observations that are close to the time of interest.

        "Title": "Identifying temporal pathways using biomarkers in the presence of latent non-Gaussian components.",
        "Abstract": "Time-series data collected from a network of random variables are useful for identifying temporal pathways among the network nodes. Observed measurements may contain multiple sources of signals and noises, including Gaussian signals of interest and non-Gaussian noises, including artifacts, structured noise, and other unobserved factors (eg, genetic risk factors, disease susceptibility). Existing methods, including vector autoregression (VAR) and dynamic causal modeling do not account for unobserved non-Gaussian components. Furthermore, existing methods cannot effectively distinguish contemporaneous relationships from temporal relations. In this work, we propose a novel method to identify latent temporal pathways using time-series biomarker data collected from multiple subjects. The model adjusts for the non-Gaussian components and separates the temporal network from the contemporaneous network. Specifically, an independent component analysis (ICA) is used to extract the unobserved non-Gaussian components, and residuals are used to estimate the contemporaneous and temporal networks among the node variables based on method of moments. The algorithm is fast and can easily scale up. We derive the identifiability and the asymptotic properties of the temporal and contemporaneous networks. We demonstrate superior performance of our method by extensive simulations and an application to a study of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), where we analyze the temporal relationships between brain regional biomarkers. We find that temporal network edges were across different brain regions, while most contemporaneous network edges were bilateral between the same regions and belong to a subset of the functional connectivity network.",

        "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the leading causes of disability-adjusted life years. Emerging evidence indicates the presence of reward processing abnormalities in MDD. An important scientific question is whether the abnormalities are due to reduced sensitivity to received rewards or reduced learning ability. Motivated by the probabilistic reward task (PRT) experiment in the EMBARC study, we propose a semiparametric inverse reinforcement learning (RL) approach to characterize the reward-based decision-making of MDD patients. The model assumes that a subject's decision-making process is updated based on a reward prediction error weighted by the subject-specific learning rate. To account for the fact that one favors a decision leading to a potentially high reward, but this decision process is not necessarily linear, we model reward sensitivity with a non-decreasing and nonlinear function. For inference, we estimate the latter via approximation by I-splines and then maximize the joint conditional log-likelihood. We show that the resulting estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that under different reward-generating distributions, the semiparametric inverse RL outperforms the parametric inverse RL. We apply the proposed method to EMBARC and find that MDD and control groups have similar learning rates but different reward sensitivity functions. There is strong statistical evidence that reward sensitivity functions have nonlinear forms. Using additional brain imaging data in the same study, we find that both reward sensitivity and learning rate are associated with brain activities in the negative affect circuitry under an emotional conflict task.",

        "Abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides noninvasive measures of brain activity and is found to be valuable for the diagnosis of some chronic disorders. Specifically, pre-treatment EEG signals in the alpha and theta frequency bands have demonstrated some association with antidepressant response, which is well-known to have a low response rate. We aim to design an integrated pipeline that improves the response rate of patients with major depressive disorder by developing a treatment policy guided by the resting state pre-treatment EEG recordings and other treatment effects modifiers. First, we design an innovative automatic site-specific EEG preprocessing pipeline to extract features with stronger signals than raw data. We then estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) using causal forests and use a doubly robust technique to improve efficiency in the estimation of the average treatment effect. We present evidence of heterogeneity in the treatment effect and the modifying power of the EEG features, as well as a significant average treatment effect, a result that cannot be obtained with conventional methods. Finally, we employ an efficient policy learning algorithm to learn an optimal depth-2 treatment assignment decision tree and compare its performance with Q-Learning and outcome-weighted learning via simulation studies and an application to a large multi-site, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial, EMBARC.",

        "Abstract": "One of the goals of precision psychiatry is to characterize mental disorders in an individualized manner, taking into account the underlying dynamic processes. Recent advances in mobile technologies have enabled the collection of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) that capture multiple responses in real-time at high frequency. However, EMA data is often multi-dimensional, correlated, and hierarchical. Mixed-effects models are commonly used but may require restrictive assumptions about the fixed and random effects and the correlation structure. The Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RTRBM) is a generative neural network that can be used to model temporal data, but most existing RTRBM approaches do not account for the potential heterogeneity of group dynamics within a population based on available covariates. In this paper, we propose a new temporal generative model, the Heterogeneous-Dynamics Restricted Boltzmann Machine (HDRBM), to learn the heterogeneous group dynamics and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on simulated and real-world EMA data sets. We show that by incorporating covariates, HDRBM can improve accuracy and interpretability, explore the underlying drivers of the group dynamics of participants, and serve as a generative model for EMA studies.",

        "Abstract": "Digital technologies (e.g., mobile phones) can be used to obtain objective, frequent, and real-world digital phenotypes from individuals. However, modeling these data poses substantial challenges since observational data are subject to confounding and various sources of variabilities. For example, signals on patients' underlying health status and treatment effects are mixed with variation due to the living environment and measurement noises. The digital phenotype data thus shows extensive variabilities between- and within-patient as well as across different health domains (e.g., motor, cognitive, and speaking). Motivated by a mobile health study of Parkinson's disease (PD), we develop a mixed-response state-space (MRSS) model to jointly capture multi-dimensional, multi-modal digital phenotypes and their measurement processes by a finite number of latent state time series. These latent states reflect the dynamic health status and personalized time-varying treatment effects and can be used to adjust for informative measurements. For computation, we use the Kalman filter for Gaussian phenotypes and importance sampling with Laplace approximation for non-Gaussian phenotypes. We conduct comprehensive simulation studies and demonstrate the advantage of MRSS in modeling a mobile health study that remotely collects real-time digital phenotypes from PD patients.",

We first propose a joint modeling approach to characterize patient's pretreatment conditions using longitudinal markers from EHRs. The estimation accounts for informative measurement times using inverse-intensity weighting methods. The predicted latent processes in the joint model are used to divide patients into a finite of subgroups and, within each group, patients share similar health profiles in EHRs. Within each patient group, we estimate optimal individualized treatment rules by extending a matched learning method to handle multicategory treatments using a one-versus-one approach. Each matched learning for two treatments is implemented by a weighted support vector machine with matched pairs of patients. We apply our method to estimate optimal treatment rules for T2D patients in a large sample of EHRs from the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. We demonstrate the utility of our method to select the optimal treatments from four classes of drugs and achieve a better control of glycated hemoglobin than any one-size-fits-all rules.",

This has led to increased genetic testing fueled by both patient and consumer interest and emerging clinical trials targeting genetic forms of the disease. Attention has turned to prodromal forms of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, resulting in assessments of individuals at risk, with genetic testing often included in the evaluation. These trends suggest that neurologists, clinical geneticists, genetic counselors, and other clinicians across primary care and various specialties should be prepared to answer questions about PD genetic risks and test results. The aim of this article is to provide genetic information for professionals to use in their communication to patients and families who have experienced PD. This includes up-to-date information on PD genes, variants, inheritance patterns, and chances of disease to be used for risk counseling, as well as insurance considerations and ethical issues.",

        "Abstract": "Current diagnosis of neurological disorders often relies on late-stage clinical symptoms, which poses barriers to developing effective interventions at the premanifest stage. Recent research suggests that biomarkers and subtle changes in clinical markers may occur in a time-ordered fashion and can be used as indicators of early disease. In this article, we tackle the challenges to leverage multidomain markers to learn early disease progression of neurological disorders. We propose to integrate heterogeneous types of measures from multiple domains (e.g., discrete clinical symptoms, ordinal cognitive markers, continuous neuroimaging, and blood biomarkers) using a hierarchical Multilayer Exponential Family Factor (MEFF) model, where the observations follow exponential family distributions with lower-dimensional latent factors. The latent factors are decomposed into shared factors across multiple domains and domain-specific factors, where the shared factors provide robust information to perform extensive phenotyping and partition patients into clinically meaningful and biologically homogeneous subgroups. Domain-specific factors capture remaining unique variations for each domain. The MEFF model also captures nonlinear trajectory of disease progression and orders critical events of neurodegeneration measured by each marker. To overcome computational challenges, we fit our model by approximate inference techniques for large-scale data. We apply the developed method to Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative data to integrate biological, clinical, and cognitive markers arising from heterogeneous distributions. The model learns lower-dimensional representations of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the temporal ordering of the neurodegeneration of PD.",

Electroencephalogram (EEG) as a noninvasive neuroimaging technique measures changes in electrical voltage on the scalp induced by brain cortical activity. With its high temporal resolution, EEG has emerged as an increasingly useful tool to study brain connectivity. Challenges with modeling EEG signals of complex brain activity include interactions among unknown sources, low signal-to-noise ratio, and substantial between-subject heterogeneity. In this work, we propose a state space model that jointly analyzes multichannel EEG signals and learns dynamics of different sources corresponding to brain cortical activity. Our model borrows strength from spatially correlated measurements and uses low-dimensional latent states to explain all observed channels. The model can account for patient heterogeneity and quantify the effect of a subject's covariates on the latent space. The EM algorithm, Kalman filtering, and bootstrap resampling are used to fit the state space model and provide comparisons between patient diagnostic groups. We apply the developed approach to a case-control study of alcoholism and reveal significant attenuation of brain activity in response to visual stimuli in alcoholic subjects compared to healthy\u00a0controls.",

        "Abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented negative impacts on our society, including further exposing inequity and disparity in public health. To study the impact of socioeconomic factors on COVID transmission, we first propose a spatial-temporal model to examine the socioeconomic heterogeneity and spatial correlation of COVID-19 transmission at the community level. Second, to assess the individual risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes after a positive diagnosis, we propose a dynamic, varying-coefficient model that integrates individual-level risk factors from electronic health records (EHRs) with community-level risk factors. The underlying neighborhood prevalence of infections (both symptomatic and pre-symptomatic) predicted from the previous spatial-temporal model is included in the individual risk assessment so as to better capture the background risk of virus exposure for each individual. We design a weighting scheme to mitigate multiple selection biases inherited in EHRs of COVID patients. We analyze COVID transmission data in New York City (NYC, the epicenter of the first surge in the United States) and EHRs from NYC hospitals, where time-varying effects of community risk factors and significant interactions between individual- and community-level risk factors are detected. By examining the socioeconomic disparity of infection risks and interaction among the risk factors, our methods can assist public health decision-making and facilitate better clinical management of COVID patients.",

To leverage these forecasts, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) partnered with an academic research lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to create the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Launched in April 2020, the Forecast Hub is a dataset with point and probabilistic forecasts of incident cases, incident hospitalizations, incident deaths, and cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 at county, state, and national, levels in the United States. Included forecasts represent a variety of modeling approaches, data sources, and assumptions regarding the spread of COVID-19. The goal of this dataset is to establish a standardized and comparable set of short-term forecasts from modeling teams. These data can be used to develop ensemble models, communicate forecasts to the public, create visualizations, compare models, and inform policies regarding COVID-19 mitigation. These open-source data are available via download from GitHub, through an online API, and through R packages.",

        "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented global public health challenge. In the United States (US), state governments have implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as physical distance closure (lockdown), stay-at-home order, mandatory facial mask in public in response to the rapid spread of COVID-19. To evaluate the effectiveness of these NPIs, we propose a nested case-control design with propensity score weighting under the quasi-experiment framework to estimate the average intervention effect on disease transmission across states. We further develop a method to test for factors that moderate intervention effect to assist precision public health intervention. Our method takes account of the underlying dynamics of disease transmission and balance state-level pre-intervention characteristics. We prove that our estimator provides causal intervention effect under assumptions. We apply this method to analyze US COVID-19 incidence cases to estimate the effects of six interventions. We show that lockdown has the largest effect on reducing transmission and reopening bars significantly increase transmission.

        "Abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) collected from large-scale health systems provide rich subject-specific information on a broad patient population at a lower cost compared to randomized controlled trials. Thus, EHRs may serve as a complementary resource to provide real-world data to construct individualized treatment rules (ITRs) and achieve precision medicine. However, in the absence of randomization, inferring treatment rules from EHR data may suffer from unmeasured confounding. In this article, we propose a self-matched learning method inspired by the self-controlled case series (SCCS) design to mitigate this challenge. We alleviate unmeasured time-invariant confounding between patients by matching different periods of treatments within the same patient (self-controlled matching) to infer the optimal ITRs. The proposed method constructs a within-subject matched value function for optimizing ITRs and bears similarity to the SCCS design. We examine assumptions that ensure Fisher consistency, and show that our method requires weaker assumptions on unmeasured confounding than alternative methods. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that self-matched learning has comparable performance to other existing methods when there are no unmeasured confounders, but performs markedly better when unobserved time-invariant confounders are present, which is often the case for EHRs. Sensitivity analyses show that the proposed method is robust under different scenarios. Finally, we apply self-matched learning to estimate the optimal ITRs from type 2 diabetes patient EHRs, which shows our estimated decision rules lead to greater advantages in reducing patients' diabetes-related complications.",

        "Abstract": "Short-term probabilistic forecasts of the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States have served as a visible and important communication channel between the scientific modeling community and both the general public and decision-makers. Forecasting models provide specific, quantitative, and evaluable predictions that inform short-term decisions such as healthcare staffing needs, school closures, and allocation of medical supplies. Starting in April 2020, the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) collected, disseminated, and synthesized tens of millions of specific predictions from more than 90 different academic, industry, and independent research groups. A multimodel ensemble forecast that combined predictions from dozens of groups every week provided the most consistently accurate probabilistic forecasts of incident deaths due to COVID-19 at the state and national level from April 2020 through October 2021. The performance of 27 individual models that submitted complete forecasts of COVID-19 deaths consistently throughout this year showed high variability in forecast skill across time, geospatial units, and forecast horizons. Two-thirds of the models evaluated showed better accuracy than a na\u00efve baseline model. Forecast accuracy degraded as models made predictions further into the future, with probabilistic error at a 20-wk horizon three to five times larger than when predicting at a 1-wk horizon. This project underscores the role that collaboration and active coordination between governmental public-health agencies, academic modeling teams, and industry partners can play in developing modern modeling capabilities to support local, state, and federal response to outbreaks.",

        "Abstract": "Nonparametric feature selection for high-dimensional data is an important and challenging problem in the fields of statistics and machine learning. Most of the existing methods for feature selection focus on parametric or additive models which may suffer from model misspecification. In this paper, we propose a new framework to perform nonparametric feature selection for both regression and classification problems. Under this framework, we learn prediction functions through empirical risk minimization over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The space is generated by a novel tensor product kernel, which depends on a set of parameters that determines the importance of the features. Computationally, we minimize the empirical risk with a penalty to estimate the prediction and kernel parameters simultaneously. The solution can be obtained by iteratively solving convex optimization problems. We study the theoretical property of the kernel feature space and prove the oracle selection property and Fisher consistency of our proposed method. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing methods via extensive simulation studies and applications to two real\u00a0studies.",

In addition, subject-specific risk factors (eg, genetic variants, age) can also exert external influence on the system. In this work, we develop a covariate-dependent conditional Gaussian graphical model to obtain personalized symptom networks. The strengths of network connections are modeled as a function of covariates to capture the heterogeneity among individuals and subgroups of individuals. We assess the performance of our proposed method by simulation studies and an application to a large natural history study of Huntington's disease to investigate the networks of symptoms in multiple clinical domains (motor, cognitive, psychiatric) and identify important brain imaging biomarkers that are associated with the connections. We show that the symptoms in the same clinical domain interact more often with each other than cross domains and the psychiatric subnetwork is the densest network. We validate the findings using the subjects' symptom measurements at follow-up visits.",

        "Abstract": "For mental disorders, patients' underlying mental states are non-observed latent constructs which have to be inferred from observed multi-domain measurements such as diagnostic symptoms and patient functioning scores. Additionally, substantial heterogeneity in the disease diagnosis between patients needs to be addressed for optimizing individualized treatment policy in order to achieve precision medicine. To address these challenges, we propose an integrated learning framework that can simultaneously learn patients' underlying mental states and recommend optimal treatments for each individual. This learning framework is based on the measurement theory in psychiatry for modeling multiple disease diagnostic measures as arising from the underlying causes (true mental states). It allows incorporation of the multivariate pre- and post-treatment outcomes as well as biological measures while preserving the invariant structure for representing patients' latent mental states. A multi-layer neural network is used to allow complex treatment effect heterogeneity. Optimal treatment policy can be inferred for future patients by comparing their potential mental states under different treatments given the observed multi-domain pre-treatment measurements. Experiments on simulated data and a real-world clinical trial data show that the learned treatment polices compare favorably to alternative methods on heterogeneous treatment effects, and have broad utilities which lead to better patient outcomes on multiple domains.",

        "Abstract": "For many mental disorders, latent mental status from multiple-domain psychological or clinical symptoms may perform as a better characterization of the underlying disorder status than a simple summary score of the symptoms, and they may also serve as more reliable and representative features to differentiate treatment responses. Therefore, in order to address the complexity and heterogeneity of treatment responses for mental disorders, we provide a new paradigm for learning optimal individualized treatment rules (ITRs) by modeling patients' latent mental status. We first learn the multi-domain latent states at baseline from the observed symptoms under a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) model, through which patients' heterogeneous symptoms are represented using an economical number of latent variables and yet remains flexible. We then optimize a value function defined by the latent states after treatment by exploiting a transformation of the observed symptoms based on the RBM without modeling the relationship between the latent mental states before and after treatment. The optimal treatment rules are derived using a weighted large margin classifier. We derive the convergence rate of the proposed estimator under the latent models. Simulation studies are conducted to test the performance of the proposed method. Finally, we apply the developed method to real world studies and we demonstrate the utility and advantage of our method in tailoring treatments for patients with major depression, and identify patient subgroups informative for treatment recommendations.",

        "Abstract": "The biomarker networks measured by different modalities of data (e.g., structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)) may share the same true underlying biological model. In this work, we propose a node-wise biomarker graphical model to leverage the shared mechanism between multi-modality data to provide a more reliable estimation of the target modality network and account for the heterogeneity in networks due to differences between subjects and networks of external modality. Latent variables are introduced to represent the shared unobserved biological network and the information from the external modality is incorporated to model the distribution of the underlying biological network. We propose an efficient approximation to the posterior expectation of the latent variables that reduces computational cost by at least 50%. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by extensive simulation studies and an application to construct gray matter brain atrophy network of Huntington's disease by using sMRI data and DTI data. The identified network connections are more consistent with clinical literature and better improve prediction in follow-up clinical outcomes and separate subjects into clinically meaningful subgroups with different prognosis than alternative methods.",

        "Abstract": "Dynamical systems based on differential equations are useful for modeling the temporal evolution of biomarkers. These systems can characterize the temporal patterns of biomarkers and inform the detection of interactions among biomarkers. Existing statistical methods for dynamical systems mostly target single time-course data based on a linear model or generalized additive model. Hence, they cannot adequately capture the complex interactions among biomarkers; neither can they take into account the heterogeneity between systems or subjects. in this work, we propose a semiparametric dynamical system based on multi-index models for multiple subjects time-course data. Our model accounts for between-subject heterogeneity by introducing system-level or subject-level covariates to dynamic systems, and it allows for nonlinear relationship and interaction between the combined biomarkers and the temporal rate of each biomarker. For estimation and inference, we consider a two-step procedure based on integral equations from the proposed model. We propose an algorithm that iterates between the estimation of the link function through splines and the estimation of index parameters and that allows for regularization to achieve sparsity. We prove model identifiability and derive the asymptotic properties of the estimated model parameters. A benefit of our approach is to pool information from multiple subjects to identify the interaction among biomarkers. We apply the method to analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) data for patients affected by alcohol dependence. The results reveal new insight on patients' brain activities and demonstrate differential interaction patterns in patients compared to health control subjects.",

        "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented global public health challenge. In the United States (US), state governments have implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as physical distance closure (lockdown), stay-at-home order, mandatory facial mask in public in response to the rapid spread of COVID-19. To evaluate the effectiveness of these NPIs, we propose a nested case-control design with propensity score weighting under the quasi-experiment framework to estimate the average intervention effect on disease transmission across states. We further develop a method to test for factors that moderate intervention effect to assist precision public health intervention. Our method takes account of the underlying dynamics of disease transmission and balance state-level pre-intervention characteristics. We prove that our estimator provides causal intervention effect under assumptions. We apply this method to analyze US COVID-19 incidence cases to estimate the effects of six interventions. We show that lockdown has the largest effect on reducing transmission and reopening bars significantly increase transmission. States with a higher percentage of non-white population are at greater risk of increased $R_t$ associated with reopening bars.",

        "Abstract": "The liver is an organ with impressive regenerative potential and has been shown to heal sizable portions after their removal. However, certain diseases can overstimulate its potential to self-heal and cause excessive cellular matrix and collagen buildup. Decompensation of liver fibrosis leads to cirrhosis, a buildup of fibrotic ECM that impedes the liver's ability to efficiently exchange fluid. This review summarizes the complex immunological activities in different liver diseases, and how failure to maintain liver homeostasis leads to progressive fibrotic tissue development. We also discuss a variety of pathologies that lead to liver cirrhosis, such as alcoholic liver disease and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV). Mesenchymal stem cells are widely studied for their potential in tissue replacement and engineering. Herein, we discuss the potential of MSCs to regulate immune response and alter the disease state. Substantial efforts have been performed in preclinical animal testing, showing promising results following inhibition of host immunity. Finally, we outline the current state of clinical trials with mesenchymal stem cells and other cellular and non-cellular therapies as they relate to the detection and treatment of liver cirrhosis.",

        "Abstract": "Practice guidelines for adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) recommend augmenting serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) with exposure and ritual prevention (EX/RP). However, fewer than half of patients remit after a standard 17-session EX/RP course. We studied whether extending the course increased overall remission rates and which patient factors predicted remission. Participants were 137 adults with clinically significant OCD (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale [Y-BOCS] score \u226518) despite an adequate SRI trial (\u226512 weeks). Continuing their SRI, patients received 17 sessions of twice-weekly EX/RP (standard course). Patients who did not remit (Y-BOCS \u226412) received up to 8 additional sessions (extended course). Of 137 entrants, 123 completed treatment: 49 (35.8%) remitted with the standard course and another 46 (33.6%) with the extended course. Poorer patient homework adherence, more Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) traits, and the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) Val66MET genotype were associated with lower odds of standard course remission. Only homework adherence differentiated non-remitters from extended course remitters. Extending the EX/RP course from 17 to 25 sessions enabled many (69.3%) OCD patients on SRIs to achieve remission. Although behavioral (patient homework adherence), psychological (OCPD traits), and biological (BDNF genotype) factors influenced odds of EX/RP remission, homework adherence was the most potent patient factor overall.",

        "Abstract": "Assessing disease comorbidity patterns in families represents the first step in gene mapping for diseases and is central to the practice of precision medicine. One way to evaluate the relative contributions of genetic risk factor and environmental determinants of a complex trait (e.g., Alzheimer's disease [AD]) and its comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular diseases [CVD]) is through familial studies, where an initial cohort of subjects are recruited, genotyped for specific loci, and interviewed to provide extensive disease history in family members. Because of the retrospective nature of obtaining disease phenotypes in family members, the exact time of disease onset may not be available such that current status data or interval-censored data are observed. All existing methods for analyzing these family study data assume single event subject to right-censoring so are not applicable. In this article, we propose a semiparametric regression model for the family history data that assumes a family-specific random effect and individual random effects to account for the dependence due to shared environmental exposures and unobserved genetic relatedness, respectively. To incorporate multiple events, we jointly model the onset of the primary disease of interest and a secondary disease outcome that is subject to interval-censoring. We propose nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation and develop a stable Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for computation. We establish the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators and examine the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies. Our application to a real world study reveals that the main contribution of comorbidity between AD and CVD is due to genetic factors instead of environmental factors.",

        "Abstract": "Consumer wearables and sensors are a rich source of data about patients' daily disease and symptom burden, particularly in the case of movement disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD). However, interpreting these complex data into so-called digital biomarkers requires complicated analytical approaches, and validating these biomarkers requires sufficient data and unbiased evaluation methods. Here we describe the use of crowdsourcing to specifically evaluate and benchmark features derived from accelerometer and gyroscope data in two different datasets to predict the presence of PD and severity of three PD symptoms: tremor, dyskinesia, and bradykinesia. Forty teams from around the world submitted features, and achieved drastically improved predictive performance for PD status (best AUROC\u2009=\u20090.87), as well as tremor- (best AUPR\u2009=\u20090.75), dyskinesia- (best AUPR\u2009=\u20090.48) and bradykinesia-severity (best AUPR\u2009=\u20090.95).",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to extend support vector machine (SVM) for binary classification to multicategory classification. The proposed method is based on a sequential binary classification algorithm: we first classify a target class by excluding the possibility of labeling as any other classes using a forward step of sequential SVM; we then exclude the already classified classes and repeat the same procedure for the remaining classes in a backward step. The proposed algorithm relies on SVM for each binary classification and utilizes only feasible data in each step; therefore, the method guarantees convergence and entails light computational burden. We prove Fisher consistency of the proposed forward-backward-SVM (FB-SVM) and obtain a stochastic bound for the predicted misclassification rate. We conduct extensive simulations and analyze real-world data to demonstrate the superior performance of FB-SVM, for example, FB-SVM achieves a classification accuracy much higher than the current standard for predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) from type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients consist of longitudinally and sparsely measured health markers at clinical encounters. Our goal is to use such data to learn latent patterns that can inform patient's health status related to T2D while accounting for challenges in retrospectively collected EHRs. To handle challenges such as correlated longitudinal measurements, irregular and informative encounter times, and mixed marker types, we propose multivariate generalized linear models to learn latent patient subgroups. In our model, covariate effects were time-dependent and latent Gaussian processes were introduced to model between-marker correlations over time. Using inferred latent processes, we integrated the irregularly measured health markers of mixed types into composite scores and applied hierarchical clustering to learn latent subgroup structures among T2D patients. Application to an EHR dataset of T2D patients showed different trends of age, sex, and race effects on hypertension/high blood pressure, total cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, high-density lipoprotein, and medications. The associations among these markers varied over time during the study window. Clustering results revealed four subgroups, each with distinct health status. The same patterns were further confirmed using new EHR records of the same cohort. We developed a novel latent model to integrate longitudinal health markers in EHRs and characterize patient latent heterogeneities. Analysis indicated that there were distinct subgroups of T2D patients, suggesting that effective healthcare managements for these patients should be performed separately for each subgroup.",

        "Abstract": "Current guidelines for treatment decision making largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying average treatment effects. They may be inadequate to make individualized treatment decisions in real-world settings. Large-scale electronic health records (EHR) provide opportunities to fulfill the goals of personalized medicine and learn individualized treatment rules (ITRs) depending on patient-specific characteristics from real-world patient data. In this work, we tackle challenges with EHRs and propose a machine learning approach based on matching (M-learning) to estimate optimal ITRs from EHRs. This new learning method performs matching instead of inverse probability weighting as commonly used in many existing methods for estimating ITRs to more accurately assess individuals' treatment responses to alternative treatments and alleviate confounding. Matching-based value functions are proposed to compare matched pairs under a unified framework, where various types of outcomes for measuring treatment response (including continuous, ordinal, and discrete outcomes) can easily be accommodated. We establish the Fisher consistency and convergence rate of M-learning. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that M-learning outperforms existing methods when propensity scores are misspecified or when unmeasured confounders are present in certain scenarios. Lastly, we apply M-learning to estimate optimal personalized second-line treatments for type 2 diabetes patients to achieve better glycemic control or reduce major complications using EHRs from New York Presbyterian Hospital.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical studies with time-to-event outcomes often collect measurements of a large number of time-varying covariates over time (e.g., clinical assessments or neuroimaging biomarkers) to build time-sensitive prognostic model. An emerging challenge is that due to resource-intensive or invasive (e.g., lumbar puncture) data collection process, biomarkers may be measured infrequently and thus not available at every observed event time point. Lever-aging all available, infrequently measured time-varying biomarkers to improve prognostic model of event occurrence is an important and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a kernel-smoothing based approach to borrow information across subjects to remedy infrequent and unbalanced biomarker measurements under a time-varying hazards model. A penalized pseudo-likelihood function is proposed for estimation, and an efficient augmented penalization minimization algorithm related to the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is adopted for computation. Under some regularity conditions to carefully control approximation bias and stochastic variability, we show that even in the presence of ultra-high dimensionality, the proposed method selects important biomarkers with high probability. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate superior performance in terms of estimation and selection performance compared to alternative methods. Finally, we apply the proposed method to analyze a recently completed real world study to model time to disease conversion using longitudinal, whole brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers, and show a substantial improvement in performance over current standards including using baseline measures only.",

        "Abstract": "Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) adaptively prescribe treatments based on patients' intermediate responses and evolving health status over multiple treatment stages. Data from sequential multiple assignment randomization trials (SMARTs) are recommended to be used for learning DTRs. However, due to re-randomization of the same patients over multiple treatment stages and a prolonged follow-up period, SMARTs are often difficult to implement and costly to manage, and patient adherence is always a concern in practice. To lessen such practical challenges, we propose an alternative approach to learn optimal DTRs by synthesizing independent trials over different stages. Specifically, at each stage, data from a single randomized trial along with patients' natural medical history and health status in previous stages are used. We use a backward learning method to estimate optimal treatment decisions at a particular stage, where patients' future optimal outcome increments are estimated using data observed from independent trials with future stages' information. Under some conditions, we show that the proposed method yields consistent estimation of the optimal DTRs and we obtain the same learning rates as those from SMARTs. We conduct simulation studies to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method. Finally, we learn optimal DTRs for treating major depressive disorder (MDD) by stagewise synthesis of two randomized trials. We perform a validation study on independent subjects and show that the synthesized DTRs lead to the greatest MDD symptom reduction compared to alternative methods.",

        "Abstract": "Individualized treatment rules (ITRs) tailor medical treatments according to patient-specific characteristics in order to optimize patient outcomes. Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are used to infer valid ITRs using statistical and machine learning methods. However, RCTs are usually conducted under specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, thus limiting their generalizability to a broader patient population in real-world practice settings. Because electronic health records (EHRs) document treatment prescriptions in the real world, transferring information in EHRs to RCTs, if done appropriately, could potentially improve the performance of ITRs, in terms of precision and generalizability. In this work, we propose a new domain adaptation method to learn ITRs by incorporating information from EHRs. Unless we assume that there is no unmeasured confounding in EHRs, we cannot directly learn the optimal ITR from the combined EHR and RCT data. Instead, we first pretrain \"super\" features from EHRs that summarize physician treatment decisions and patient observed benefits in the real world, as these are likely to be informative of the optimal ITRs. We then augment the feature space of the RCT and learn the optimal ITRs by stratifying by super features using subjects enrolled in RCT. We adopt Q-learning and a modified matched-learning algorithm for estimation. We present heuristic justification of our method and conduct simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of super features. Finally, we apply our method to transfer information learned from EHRs of patients with type 2 diabetes to learn individualized insulin therapies from RCT\u00a0data.",

        "Abstract": "To address substantial heterogeneity in patient response to treatment of chronic disorders and achieve the promise of precision medicine, individualized treatment rules (ITRs) are estimated to tailor treatments according to patient-specific characteristics. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide gold standard data for learning ITRs not subject to confounding bias. However, RCTs are often conducted under stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria, and participants in RCTs may not reflect the general patient population. Thus, ITRs learned from RCTs lack generalizability to the broader real world patient population. Real world databases such as electronic health records (EHRs) provide new resources as complements to RCTs to facilitate evidence-based research for personalized medicine. However, to ensure the validity of ITRs learned from EHRs, a number of challenges including confounding bias and selection bias must be addressed. In this work, we propose a matching-based machine learning method to estimate optimal individualized treatment rules from EHRs using interpretable features extracted from EHR documentation of medications and ICD diagnoses codes. We use a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to extract latent topics and weights as features for learning ITRs. Our method achieves confounding reduction in observational studies through matching treated and untreated individuals and improves treatment optimization by augmenting feature space with clinically meaningful LDA-based features. We apply the method to EHR data collected at New York Presbyterian Hospital clinical data warehouse in studying optimal second-line treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. We use cross validation to show that ITRs outperforms uniform treatment strategies (i.e., assigning same treatment to all individuals), and including topic modeling features leads to more reduction of post-treatment complications.",

        "Abstract": "Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disease without clearly identified biomarkers for when motor-onset occurs. Current standards to determine motor-onset rely on a clinician's subjective judgment that a patient's extrapyramidal signs are unequivocally associated with Huntington disease. This subjectivity can lead to error which could be overcome using an objective, data-driven metric that determines motor-onset. Recent studies of motor-sign decline-the longitudinal degeneration of motor-ability in patients-have revealed that motor-onset is closely related to an inflection point in its longitudinal trajectory. We propose a nonlinear location-shift marker model that captures this motor-sign decline and assesses how its inflection point is linked to other markers of Huntington disease progression. We propose two estimating procedures to estimate this model and its inflection point: one is a parametric method using nonlinear mixed effects model and the other one is a multi-stage nonparametric approach, which we developed. In an empirical study, the parametric approach was sensitive to correct specification of the mean structure of the longitudinal data. In contrast, our multi-stage nonparametric procedure consistently produced unbiased estimates regardless of the true mean structure. Applying our multi-stage nonparametric estimator to Neurobiological Predictors of Huntington Disease, a large observational study of Huntington disease, leads to earlier prediction of motor-onset compared to the clinician's subjective judgment.",

        "Abstract": "With growing interest to use black-box machine learning for complex data with many feature variables, it is critical to obtain a prediction model that only depends on a small set of features to maximize generalizability. Therefore, feature selection remains to be an important and challenging problem in modern applications. Most of existing methods for feature selection are based on either parametric or semiparametric models, so the resulting performance can severely suffer from model misspecification when high-order nonlinear interactions among the features are present. A very limited number of approaches for nonparametric feature selection were proposed, but they are computationally intensive and may not even converge. In this paper, we propose a novel and computationally efficient approach for nonparametric feature selection in regression field based on a tensor-product kernel function over the feature space. The importance of each feature is governed by a parameter in the kernel function which can be efficiently computed iteratively from a modified alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. We prove the oracle selection property of the proposed method. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing methods via simulation studies and application to the prediction of Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Biomarkers are often organized into networks, in which the strengths of network connections vary across subjects depending on subject-specific covariates (eg, genetic variants). Variation of network connections, as subject-specific feature variables, has been found to predict disease clinical outcome. In this work, we develop a two-stage method to estimate biomarker networks that account for heterogeneity among subjects and evaluate network's association with disease clinical outcome. In the first stage, we propose a conditional Gaussian graphical model with mean and precision matrix depending on covariates to obtain covariate-dependent networks with connection strengths varying across subjects while assuming homogeneous network structure. In the second stage, we evaluate clinical utility of network measures (connection strengths) estimated from the first stage. The second-stage analysis provides the relative predictive power of between-region network measures on clinical impairment in the context of regional biomarkers and existing disease risk factors. We assess the performance of proposed method by extensive simulation studies and application to a Huntington's disease (HD) study to investigate the effect of HD causal gene on the rate of change in motor symptom through affecting brain subcortical and cortical gray matter atrophy connections. We show that cortical network connections and subcortical volumes, but not subcortical connections are identified to be predictive of clinical motor function deterioration. We validate these findings in an independent HD study. Lastly, highly similar patterns seen in the gray matter connections and a previous white matter connectivity study suggest a shared biological mechanism for HD and support the hypothesis that white matter loss is a direct result of neuronal loss as opposed to the loss of myelin or\u00a0dysmyelination.",

        "Abstract": "Neurological diseases are due to the loss of structure or function of neurons that eventually leads to cognitive deficit, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and impaired activities of daily living. Identifying sensitive and specific biological and clinical markers for early diagnosis allows recruiting patients into a clinical trial to test therapeutic intervention. However, many biomarker studies considered a single biomarker at one time that fails to provide precise prediction for disease age at onset. In this paper, we use longitudinally collected measurements from multiple biomarkers and measurement error-corrected clinical diagnosis ages to identify which biomarkers and what features of biomarker trajectories are useful for early diagnosis. Specifically, we assume that the subject-specific biomarker trajectories depend on unobserved states of underlying latent variables with the conditional mean follows a nonlinear sigmoid shape. We show that peak degeneration age of the biomarker trajectory is useful for early diagnosis. We propose an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of all parameters and conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the performance of the proposed methods. Finally, we apply our methods to studies of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease and identify a few important biomarkers that can be used for early diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "Large cohort studies are commonly launched to study risk of genetic variants or other risk factors on age at onset (AAO) of a chronic disorder. In these studies, family history data including AAO of disease in family members are collected to provide additional information and can be used to improve efficiency. Statistical analysis of these data is challenging due to missing genotypes in family members and the heterogeneous dependence attributed to both shared genetic back-ground and shared environmental factors (e.g., life style). In this paper, we propose a class of semiparametric transformation models with multilevel random effects to tackle these challenges. The proposed models include both proportional hazards model and proportional odds model as special cases. The multilevel random effects contain individual-specific random effects including kinship correlation structure dependent on the family pedigree, and a shared random effect to account for unobserved environment exposure. We use nonparametric maximum likelihood approach for inference and propose an expectation-maximization algorithm for computation in the presence of missing genotypes among family members. The obtained estimators are shown to be consistent, asymptotically normal, and semiparametrically efficient. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method performs well with finite sample sizes. Finally, the proposed method is applied to study genetic risks in an Alzheimer's disease study.",

        "Abstract": "Using biomarkers to model disease course effectively and make early prediction is a challenging but critical path to improving diagnostic accuracy and designing preventive trials for neurological disorders. Leveraging the domain knowledge that certain neuroimaging biomarkers may reflect the disease pathology, we propose a model inspired by the neural mass model from cognitive neuroscience to jointly model nonlinear dynamic trajectories of the biomarkers. Under a nonlinear mixed-effects model framework, we introduce subject- and biomarker-specific random inflection points to characterize the critical time of underlying disease progression as reflected in the biomarkers. A latent liability score is shared across biomarkers to pool information. Our model allows assessing how the underlying disease progression will affect the trajectories of the biomarkers, and, thus, is potentially useful for individual disease management or preventive therapeutics. We propose an EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation, where in the E step, a normal approximation is used to facilitate numerical integration. We perform extensive simulation studies and apply the method to analyze data from a large multisite natural history study of Huntington's Disease (HD). The results show that some neuroimaging biomarker inflection points are early signs of the HD onset. Finally, we develop an online tool to provide the individual prediction of the biomarker trajectories given the medical history and baseline measurements.",

        "Abstract": "In psychiatry, clinicians use criteria sets from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to diagnose mental disorders. Most criteria sets have several symptom domains, and in order to be diagnosed, an individual must meet the minimum number of symptoms required by each domain. Some efforts are now focused on adding biomarkers to these symptom domains to facilitate the detection of and highlight the neurobiological basis of psychiatric disorders. Thus, a new criteria set may consist of both clinical symptom counts in several domains and continuous biomarkers. In this paper, we propose a method to integrate classification rules from multiple data sources to estimate an optimal criteria set. Each domain-specific rule can be counts of symptoms, a linear function of symptoms, or even nonparametric. The overall classification rule is the intersection of these domain-specific rules. Based on examining the expected population loss function, we propose two iterative algorithms using either support vector machines or logistic regression to fit intersection rules consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. In simulation studies, these proposed methods are comparable with the true decision rule. The methods are applied to the motivating study to construct a criteria set for complicated grief. The developed criteria set shows a substantial improvement in sensitivity and specificity compared to the current standards on an independent validation study.",

        "Abstract": "To achieve personalized medicine, an individualized treatment strategy assigning treatment based on an individual's characteristics that leads to the largest benefit can be considered. Recently, a machine learning approach, O-learning, has been proposed to estimate an optimal individualized treatment rule (ITR), but it is developed to make binary decisions and thus limited to compare two treatments. When many treatment options are available, existing methods need to be adapted by transforming a multiple treatment selection problem into multiple binary treatment selections, for example, via one-vs-one or one-vs-all comparisons. However, combining multiple binary treatment selection rules into a single decision rule requires careful consideration, because it is known in the multicategory learning literature that some approaches may lead to ambiguous decision rules. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient method to generalize outcome-weighted learning for binary treatment to multi-treatment settings. We solve a multiple treatment selection problem via sequential weighted support vector machines. We prove that the resulting ITR is Fisher consistent and obtain the convergence rate of the estimated value function to the true optimal value, i.e., the estimated treatment rule leads to the maximal benefit when the data size goes to infinity. We conduct simulations to demonstrate that the proposed method has superior performance in terms of lower mis-allocation rates and improved expected values. An application to a three-arm randomized trial of major depressive disorder shows that an ITR tailored to individual patient's expectancy of treatment efficacy, their baseline depression severity and other characteristics reduces depressive symptoms more than non-personalized treatment strategies (e.g., treating all patients with combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy).",

        "Abstract": "Treatment response heterogeneity has long been observed in patients affected by chronic diseases. Administering an individualized treatment rule (ITR) offers an opportunity to tailor treatment strategies according to patient-specific characteristics. Overly complex machine learning methods for estimating ITRs may produce treatment rules that have higher benefit but lack transparency and interpretability. In clinical practices, it is desirable to derive a simple and interpretable ITR while maintaining certain optimality that leads to improved benefit in subgroups of patients, if not on the overall sample. In this work, we propose a tree-based robust learning method to estimate optimal piecewise linear ITRs and identify subgroups of patients with a large benefit. We achieve these goals by simultaneously identifying qualitative and quantitative interactions through a tree model, referred to as the composite interaction tree (CITree). We show that it has improved performance compared to existing methods on both overall sample and subgroups via extensive simulation studies. Lastly, we fit CITree to Research Evaluating the Value of Augmenting Medication with Psychotherapy trial for treating patients with major depressive disorders, where we identified both qualitative and quantitative interactions and subgroups of patients with a large benefit.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of causal relationships between random variables from large-scale observational data using directed acyclic graphs (DAG) is highly challenging. We propose a new mixed-effects structural equation model (mSEM) framework to estimate subject-specific DAGs, where we represent joint distribution of random variables in the DAG as a set of structural causal equations with mixed effects. The directed edges between nodes depend on observed exogenous covariates on each of the individual and unobserved latent variables. The strength of the connection is decomposed into a fixed-effect term representing the average causal effect given the covariates and a random effect term representing the latent causal effect due to unobserved pathways. The advantage of such decomposition is to capture essential asymmetric structural information and heterogeneity between DAGs in order to allow for the identification of causal structure with observational data. In addition, by pooling information across subject-specific DAGs, we can identify causal structure with a high probability and estimate subject-specific networks with a high precision. We propose a penalized likelihood-based approach to handle multi-dimensionality of the DAG model. We propose a fast, iterative computational algorithm, DAG-MM, to estimate parameters in mSEM and achieve desirable sparsity by hard-thresholding the edges. We theoretically prove the identifiability of mSEM. Using simulations and an application to protein signaling data, we show substantially improved performances when compared to existing methods and consistent results with a network estimated from interventional data. Lastly, we identify gray matter atrophy networks in regions of brain from patients with Huntington's disease and corroborate our findings using white matter connectivity data collected from an independent study.",

        "Title": "Nonlinear model with random inflection points for modeling neurodegenerative disease progression.",
        "Abstract": "Due to a lack of a gold standard objective marker, the current practice for diagnosing a neurological disorder is mostly based on clinical symptoms, which may occur in the late stage of the disease. Clinical diagnosis is also subject to high variance due to between- and within-subject variability of patient symptomatology and between-clinician variability. Effectively modeling disease course and making early prediction using biomarkers and subtle clinical signs are critical and challenging both for improving diagnostic accuracy and designing preventive clinical trials for neurological disorders. Leveraging the domain knowledge that certain biological characteristics (ie, causal genetic mutation) is part of the disease mechanism, and certain markers (eg, neuroimaging measures, motor and cognitive ability measures) reflect pathological process, we propose a nonlinear model with random inflection points depending on subject-specific characteristics to jointly estimate the changing trajectories of the markers in the same disease domain. The model scales different markers into comparable progression curves with a temporal order based on the mean inflection point and establishes the relationship between the progression of markers with the underlying disease mechanism. The model also assesses how subject-specific characteristics affect the dynamic trajectory of different markers, which offers information on designing preventive therapeutics and personalized disease management strategy. We perform extensive simulation studies and apply our method to markers in neuroimaging, cognitive, and motor domains of Huntington's disease using the data collected from a large multisite natural history study of Huntington's disease, where we assess the temporal ordering of disease impairment between domains. We show that atrophy from certain brain area occurs first, followed by motor and cognitive domain, and show that an average patient has already experienced substantial regional brain atrophy when reaching clinical diagnosis age.",

        "Title": "Constructing disease onset signatures using multi-dimensional network-structured biomarkers.",
        "Abstract": "Potential disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative disorders need to be introduced prior to the symptomatic stage in order to be effective. However, current diagnosis of neurological disorders mostly rely on measurements of clinical symptoms and thus only identify symptomatic subjects in their late disease course. Thus, it is of interest to select and integrate biomarkers that may reflect early disease-related pathological changes for earlier diagnosis and recruiting pre-sypmtomatic subjects in a prevention clinical trial. Two sources of biological information are relevant to the construction of biomarker signatures for time to disease onset that is subject to right censoring. First, biomarkers' effects on disease onset may vary with a subject's baseline disease stage indicated by a particular marker. Second, biomarkers may be connected through networks, and their effects on disease may be informed by this network structure. To leverage these information, we propose a varying-coefficient hazards model to induce double smoothness over the dimension of the disease stage and over the space of network-structured biomarkers. The distinctive feature of the model is a non-parametric effect that captures non-linear change according to the disease stage and similarity among the effects of linked biomarkers. For estimation and feature selection, we use kernel smoothing of a regularized local partial likelihood and derive an efficient algorithm. Numeric simulations demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods in performance and computational efficiency. Finally, the methods are applied to our motivating study, a recently completed study of Huntington's disease (HD), where structural brain imaging measures are used to inform age-at-onset of HD and assist clinical trial design. The analysis offers new insights on the structural network signatures for premanifest HD subjects.",

        "Abstract": "Individualized medical decision making is often complex due to patient treatment response heterogeneity. Pharmacotherapy may exhibit distinct efficacy and safety profiles for different patient populations. An \"optimal\" treatment that maximizes clinical benefit for a patient may also lead to concern of safety due to a high risk of adverse events. Thus, to guide individualized clinical decision making and deliver optimal tailored treatments, maximizing clinical benefit should be considered in the context of controlling for potential risk. In this work, we propose two approaches to identify personalized optimal treatment strategy that maximizes clinical benefit under a constraint on the average risk. We derive the theoretical optimal treatment rule under the risk constraint and draw an analogy to the Neyman-Pearson lemma to prove the theorem. We present algorithms that can be easily implemented by any off-the-shelf quadratic programming package. We conduct extensive simulation studies to show satisfactory risk control when maximizing the clinical benefit. Lastly, we apply our method to a randomized trial of type 2 diabetes patients to guide optimal utilization of the first line insulin treatments based on individual patient characteristics while controlling for the rate of hypoglycemia events. We identify baseline glycated hemoglobin level, body mass index, and fasting blood glucose as three key factors among 18 biomarkers to differentiate treatment assignments, and demonstrate a successful control of the risk of hypoglycemia in both the training and testing data set.",

        "Abstract": "Dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) are sequential treatment decisions tailored by patient's evolving features and intermediate outcomes at each treatment stage. Patient heterogeneity and the complexity and chronicity of many diseases call for learning optimal DTRs that can best tailor treatment according to each individual's time-varying characteristics (eg, intermediate response over time). In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient approach referred to as Augmented Outcome-weighted Learning (AOL) to identify optimal DTRs from sequential multiple assignment randomized trials. We improve previously proposed outcome-weighted learning to allow for negative weights. Furthermore, to reduce the variability of weights for numeric stability and improve estimation accuracy, in AOL, we propose a robust augmentation to the weights by making use of predicted pseudooutcomes from regression models for Q-functions. We show that AOL still yields Fisher-consistent DTRs even if the regression models are misspecified and that an appropriate choice of the augmentation guarantees smaller stochastic errors in value function estimation for AOL than the previous outcome-weighted learning. Finally, we establish the convergence rates for AOL. The comparative advantage of AOL over existing methods is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and an application to a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial for major depressive disorder.",

        "Abstract": "An important goal in clinical and statistical research is properly modeling the distribution for clustered failure times which have a natural intraclass dependency and are subject to censoring. We handle these challenges with a novel approach that does not impose restrictive modeling or distributional assumptions. Using a logit transformation, we relate the distribution for clustered failure times to covariates and a random, subject-specific effect. The covariates are modeled with unknown functional forms, and the random effect may depend on the covariates and have an unknown and unspecified distribution. We introduce pseudovalues to handle censoring and splines for functional covariate effects, and frame the problem into fitting an additive logistic mixed effects model. Unlike existing approaches for fitting such models, we develop semiparametric techniques that estimate the functional model parameters without specifying or estimating the random effect distribution. We show both theoretically and empirically that the resulting estimators are consistent for any choice of random effect distribution and any dependency structure between the random effect and covariates. Last, we illustrate the method's utility in an application to a Huntington's disease study where our method provides new insights into differences between motor and cognitive impairment event times in at-risk subjects.",

        "Abstract": "Aberrations in eating patterns constitute a substantial public health burden. Computer-based paradigms that measure responses to images of foods are potentially useful tools for assessing food attitudes and characteristics of eating behavior. In particular, food choice tasks attempt to directly probe aspects of individuals' decisions about what to eat. In the Food Choice Task participants rate the healthiness and tastiness of a variety of food items presented one at a time. Next, participants choose for each food item whether they prefer to eat the item vs. a neutrally rated reference food item. The goal of the current study was to assess the stability and reliability of this Food Choice Task over time and with repeated testing. Secondary analyses were conducted using data from healthy volunteers in two separate studies that administered the task at two time points, separated either by several days or about a month. The overall reliability of the Food Choice Task across multiple administrations was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficients and the reliability of ratings of individual food items was assessed using kappa coefficients. The results indicated that test-retest reliability of the Food Choice Task in healthy volunteers was high at both shorter and longer test-retest intervals. In addition, the reliability of individual food item ratings was good for a majority of items. The proportion of healthy volunteers' high-fat food choices did not change over time in either of the two studies. Thus, the Food Choice Task is suitable for measuring food choices in studies with multiple assessment points. In particular, the task may be well suited to assess restrictive eating, a construct which it has been difficult to assess in experimental settings.",

        "Abstract": "Mega-analysis, or the meta-analysis of individual data, enables pooling and comparing multiple studies to enhance estimation and power. A challenge in mega-analysis is estimating the distribution for clustered, potentially censored event times where the dependency structure can introduce bias if ignored. We propose a new proportional odds model with unknown, time-varying coefficients, and random effects. The model directly captures event dependencies, handles censoring using pseudo-values, and permits a simple estimation by transforming the model into an easily estimable additive logistic mixed effect model. Our method consistently estimates the distribution for clustered event times even under covariate-dependent censoring. Applied to three observational studies of Huntington's disease, our method provides, for the first time in the literature, evidence of similar conclusions about motor and cognitive impairments in all studies despite different recruitment criteria.",

        "Abstract": "Some biomedical studies lead to mixture data. When a discrete covariate defining subgroup membership is missing for some of the subjects in a study, the distribution of the outcome follows a mixture distribution of the subgroup-specific distributions. Taking into account the uncertain distribution of the group membership and the covariates, we model the relation between the disease onset time and the covariates through transformation models in each sub-population, and develop a nonparametric maximum likelihood based estimation implemented through EM algorithm along with its inference procedure. We further propose methods to identify the covariates that have different effects or common effects in distinct populations, which enables parsimonious modeling and better understanding of the difference across populations. The methods are illustrated through extensive simulation studies and a real data example.",

        "Abstract": "In clinical practice, an informative and practically useful treatment rule should be simple and transparent. However, because simple rules are likely to be far from optimal, effective methods to construct such rules must guarantee performance, in terms of yielding the best clinical outcome (highest reward) among the class of simple rules under consideration. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate the benefit of the derived rules on the whole sample and in pre-specified subgroups (e.g., vulnerable patients). To achieve both goals, we propose a robust machine learning method to estimate a linear treatment rule that is guaranteed to achieve optimal reward among the class of all linear rules. We then develop a diagnostic measure and inference procedure to evaluate the benefit of the obtained rule and compare it with the rules estimated by other methods. We provide theoretical justification for the proposed method and its inference procedure, and we demonstrate via simulations its superior performance when compared to existing methods. Lastly, we apply the method to the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial on major depressive disorder and show that the estimated optimal linear rule provides a large benefit for mildly depressed and severely depressed patients but manifests a lack-of-fit for moderately depressed patients.",

        "Abstract": "In many clinical studies, patients may be asked to report their medication adherence, presence of side effects, substance use, and hospitalization information during the study period. However, the exact occurrence time of these recurrent events may not be available due to privacy protection, recall difficulty, or incomplete medical records. Instead, the only available information is whether the events of interest have occurred during the past period. In this paper, we call these incomplete recurrent events as repeated current status data. Currently, there are no valid standard methods for this kind of data. We propose to use the Andersen-Gill proportional intensity assumption to analyze such data. Specifically, we propose a maximum sieve likelihood approach for inference and we show that the proposed estimators for regression coefficients are consistent, asymptotically normal and attain semiparametric efficiency bounds. Simulation studies show that the proposed approach performs well with small sample sizes. Finally, our method is applied to study medication adherence in a clinical trial on non-psychotic major depressive disorder.",

        "Abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a CAG trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin gene. We now have the power to predict age-at-onset from subject-specific features like motor and neuroimaging measures. In clinical trials, properly modeling onset age is important, because it improves power calculations and directs clinicians to recruit subjects with certain features. The history of modeling onset, from simple linear and logistic regression to advanced survival models, is discussed. We highlight their advantages and disadvantages, emphasizing the methodological challenges when genetic mutation status is unavailable. We also discuss the potential bias and higher variability incurred from the uncertainty associated with subjective definitions for onset. Methods to adjust for the uncertainty in survival models are still in their infancy, but would be beneficial for HD and neurodegenerative diseases with long prodromal periods like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Mismatch negativity (MMN) deficits in schizophrenia (SCZ) have been studied extensively since the early 1990s, with the vast majority of studies using simple auditory oddball task deviants that vary in a single acoustic dimension such as pitch or duration. There has been a growing interest in using more complex deviants that violate more abstract rules to probe higher order cognitive deficits. It is still unclear how sensory processing deficits compare to and contribute to higher order cognitive dysfunction, which can be investigated with later attention-dependent auditory event-related potential (ERP) components such as a subcomponent of P300, P3b. In this meta-analysis, we compared MMN deficits in SCZ using simple deviants to more complex deviants. We also pooled studies that measured MMN and P3b in the same study sample and examined the relationship between MMN and P3b deficits within study samples. Our analysis reveals that, to date, studies using simple deviants demonstrate larger deficits than those using complex deviants, with effect sizes in the range of moderate to large. The difference in effect sizes between deviant types was reduced significantly when accounting for magnitude of MMN measured in healthy controls. P3b deficits, while large, were only modestly greater than MMN deficits (d=0.21). Taken together, our findings suggest that MMN to simple deviants may still be optimal as a biomarker for SCZ and that sensory processing dysfunction contributes significantly to MMN deficit and disease pathophysiology.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge about the effect of a US service member's death on surviving family members is limited. In order to identify their grief-related health care needs, a first step is to identify the characteristics of persistent and elevated grief in a military family sample. The present study identified military family members (n\u00a0=\u00a0232) bereaved more than six months who endorsed an elevated level of grief. A confirmatory factor analysis and test of measurement invariance of factor structure were used to compare the factor structure of their Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) responses to that of a bereaved non-military-related clinical research sample with similar grief levels. Results confirmed an equivalent five-factor structure of the ICG in both the military family sample and the clinical research sample. The similarity in factor structure was present despite differences in demographic characteristics and bereavement experiences between samples. Thus, the ICG reliably measures persistent and elevated grief in military family samples and provides grief symptom profiles that facilitates better understanding of their grief-related needs.",

        "Title": "Estimation of genetic risk function with covariates in the presence of missing genotypes.",
        "Abstract": "In genetic epidemiological studies, family history data are collected on relatives of study participants and used to estimate the age-specific risk of disease for individuals who carry a causal mutation. However, a family member's genotype data may not be collected because of the high cost of in-person interview to obtain blood sample or death of a relative. Previously, efficient nonparametric genotype-specific risk estimation in censored mixture data has been proposed without considering covariates. With multiple predictive risk factors available, risk estimation requires a multivariate model to account for additional covariates that may affect disease risk simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to consider the role of covariates in genotype-specific distribution estimation using family history data. We propose an estimation method that permits more precise risk prediction by controlling for individual characteristics and incorporating interaction effects with missing genotypes in relatives, and thus, gene-gene interactions and gene-environment interactions can be handled within the framework of a single model. We examine performance of the proposed methods by simulations and apply them to estimate the age-specific cumulative risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in carriers of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation using first-degree relatives who are at genetic risk for PD. The utility of estimated carrier risk is demonstrated through designing a future clinical trial under various assumptions. Such sample size estimation is seen in the Huntington's disease literature using the length of abnormal expansion of a CAG repeat in the HTT gene but is less common in the PD literature.

        "Title": "Conversion Discriminative Analysis on Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Multiple Cortical Features from MR Images.",
        "Abstract": "Neuroimaging measurements derived from magnetic resonance imaging provide important information required for detecting changes related to the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cortical features and changes play a crucial role in revealing unique anatomical patterns of brain regions, and further differentiate MCI patients from normal states. Four cortical features, namely, gray matter volume, cortical thickness, surface area, and mean curvature, were explored for discriminative analysis among three groups including the stable MCI (sMCI), the converted MCI (cMCI), and the normal control (NC) groups. In this study, 158 subjects (72 NC, 46 sMCI, and 40 cMCI) were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. A sparse-constrained regression model based on the l2-1-norm was introduced to reduce the feature dimensionality and retrieve essential features for the discrimination of the three groups by using a support vector machine (SVM). An optimized strategy of feature addition based on the weight of each feature was adopted for the SVM classifier in order to achieve the best classification performance. The baseline cortical features combined with the longitudinal measurements for 2 years of follow-up data yielded prominent classification results. In particular, the cortical thickness produced a classification with 98.84% accuracy, 97.5% sensitivity, and 100% specificity for the sMCI-cMCI comparison; 92.37% accuracy, 84.78% sensitivity, and 97.22% specificity for the cMCI-NC comparison; and 93.75% accuracy, 92.5% sensitivity, and 94.44% specificity for the sMCI-NC comparison. The best performances obtained by the SVM classifier using the essential features were 5-40% more than those using all of the retained features. The feasibility of the cortical features for the recognition of anatomical patterns was certified; thus, the proposed method has the potential to improve the clinical diagnosis of sub-types of MCI and predict the risk of its conversion to Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Medical research is experiencing a paradigm shift from \"one-size-fits-all\" strategy to a precision medicine approach where the right therapy, for the right patient, and at the right time, will be prescribed. We propose a statistical method to estimate the optimal individualized treatment rules (ITRs) that are tailored according to subject-specific features using electronic health records (EHR) data. Our approach merges statistical modeling and medical domain knowledge with machine learning algorithms to assist personalized medical decision making using EHR. We transform the estimation of optimal ITR into a classification problem and account for the non-experimental features of the EHR data and confounding by clinical indication. We create a broad range of feature variables that reflect both patient health status and healthcare data collection process. Using EHR data collected at Columbia University clinical data warehouse, we construct a decision tree for choosing the best second line therapy for treating type 2 diabetes patients.",

        "Abstract": "Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the most effective treatment for severe depression, some patients report persistent memory problems following ECT that impact their quality of life and their willingness to consent to further ECT. While cognitive training has been shown to improve memory performance in various conditions, this approach has never been applied to help patients regain their memory after ECT. In a double-blind study, we tested the efficacy of a new cognitive training program called Memory Training for ECT (Mem-ECT), specifically designed to target anterograde and retrograde memory that can be compromised following ECT. Fifty-nine patients with treatment-resistant depression scheduled to undergo ultra-brief right unilateral ECT were randomly assigned to either: (a) Mem-ECT, (b) active control comprised of nonspecific mental stimulation, or (c) treatment as usual. Participants were evaluated within one week prior to the start of ECT and then again within 2 weeks following the last ECT session. All three groups improved in global function, quality of life, depression, and self-reported memory abilities without significant group differences. While there was a decline in verbal delayed recall and mental status, there was no decline in general retrograde memory or autobiographical memory in any of the groups, with no significant memory or clinical benefit for the Mem-ECT or active control conditions compared to treatment as usual. While we report negative findings, these results continue to promote the much needed discussion on developing effective strategies to minimize the adverse memory side effects of ECT, in hopes it will make ECT a better and more easily tolerated treatment for patients with severe depression who need this therapeutic option.",

        "Title": "Penalized nonlinear mixed effects model to identify biomarkers that predict disease progression.",
        "Abstract": "Precise modeling of disease progression in neurodegenerative disorders may enable early intervention before clinical manifestation of a disease, which is crucial since early intervention at the premanifest stage is expected to be more effective. Neuroimaging biomarkers are indicative of the underlying disease pathology and may be used to predict future disease occurrence at the premanifest stage. As observed in many pivotal studies, longitudinal measurements of clinical outcomes, such as motor or cognitive symptoms, often present nonlinear sigmoid shapes over time, where the inflection points of the trajectories mark a meaningful time in disease progression. Therefore, to identify neuroimaging biomarkers predicting disease progression, we propose a nonlinear mixed effects model based on a sigmoid function to predict longitudinal clinical outcomes, and associate a linear combination of neuroimaging biomarkers with subject-specific inflection points. Based on an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, we propose a method that can fit a nonlinear model with many potentially correlated biomarkers for random inflection points while achieving computational stability. Variable selection is introduced in the algorithm in order to identify important biomarkers of disease progression and to reduce prediction variability. We apply the proposed method to the data from the Predictors of Huntington's Disease study to select brain subcortical regional volumes predictive of the inflection points of the motor and cognitive function trajectories. Our results reveal that brain atrophy in the striatum and expansion of the ventricular system are highly predictive of the inflection points. Furthermore, these inflection points may precede clinically defined disease onset by as early as a decade and thus may be useful biomarkers as early signs of Huntington's Disease onset.",

        "Title": "Support Vector Hazards Machine: A Counting Process Framework for Learning Risk Scores for Censored Outcomes.",
        "Abstract": "Learning risk scores to predict dichotomous or continuous outcomes using machine learning approaches has been studied extensively. However, how to learn risk scores for time-to-event outcomes subject to right censoring has received little attention until recently. Existing approaches rely on inverse probability weighting or rank-based regression, which may be inefficient. In this paper, we develop a new support vector hazards machine (SVHM) approach to predict censored outcomes. Our method is based on predicting the counting process associated with the time-to-event outcomes among subjects at risk via a series of support vector machines. Introducing counting processes to represent time-to-event data leads to a connection between support vector machines in supervised learning and hazards regression in standard survival analysis. To account for different at risk populations at observed event times, a time-varying offset is used in estimating risk scores. The resulting optimization is a convex quadratic programming problem that can easily incorporate non-linearity using kernel trick. We demonstrate an interesting link from the profiled empirical risk function of SVHM to the Cox partial likelihood. We then formally show that SVHM is optimal in discriminating covariate-specific hazard function from population average hazard function, and establish the consistency and learning rate of the predicted risk using the estimated risk scores. Simulation studies show improved prediction accuracy of the event times using SVHM compared to existing machine learning methods and standard conventional approaches. Finally, we analyze two real world biomedical study data where we use clinical markers and neuroimaging biomarkers to predict age-at-onset of a disease, and demonstrate superiority of SVHM in distinguishing high risk versus low risk subjects.",

        "Abstract": "There is an increasing demand for personalization of disease screening based on assessment of patient risk and other characteristics. For example, in breast cancer screening, advanced imaging technologies have made it possible to move away from 'one-size-fits-all' screening guidelines to targeted risk-based screening for those who are in need. Because diagnostic performance of various imaging modalities may vary across subjects, applying the most accurate modality to the patients who would benefit the most requires personalized strategy. To address these needs, we propose novel machine learning methods to estimate personalized diagnostic rules for medical screening or diagnosis by maximizing a weighted combination of sensitivity and specificity across subgroups of subjects. We first develop methods that can be applied when competing modalities or screening strategies that are observed on the same subject (paired design). Next, we present methods for studies where not all subjects receive both modalities (unpaired design). We study theoretical properties including consistency and risk bound of the personalized diagnostic rules and conduct simulation studies to examine performance of the proposed methods. Lastly, we analyze data collected from a brain imaging study of Parkinson's disease using positron emission tomography and diffusion tensor imaging with paired and unpaired designs. Our results show that in some cases, a personalized modality assignment is estimated to improve empirical area under the receiver operating curve compared with a 'one-size-fits-all' assignment strategy.

After adjusting for baseline demographic features, time since death and relationship to the deceased, those with CG after suicide had the highest rates of lifetime depression, preloss passive suicidal ideation, self-blaming thoughts, and impaired work and social adjustment.

        "Abstract": "Sequential multiple assignment randomization trial (SMART) is a powerful design to study Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) and allows causal comparisons of DTRs. To handle practical challenges of SMART, we propose a SMART with Enrichment (SMARTER) design, which performs stage-wise enrichment for SMART. SMARTER can improve design efficiency, shorten the recruitment period, and partially reduce trial duration to make SMART more practical with limited time and resource. Specifically, at each subsequent stage of a SMART, we enrich the study sample with new patients who have received previous stages' treatments in a naturalistic fashion without randomization, and only randomize them among the current stage treatment options. One extreme case of the SMARTER is to synthesize separate independent single-stage randomized trials with patients who have received previous stage treatments. We show data from SMARTER allows for unbiased estimation of DTRs as SMART does under certain assumptions. Furthermore, we show analytically that the efficiency gain of the new design over SMART can be significant especially when the dropout rate is high. Lastly, extensive simulation studies are performed to demonstrate performance of SMARTER design, and sample size estimation in a scenario informed by real data from a SMART study is presented.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to examine the relative reinforcing effect of exercise compared to a non-monetary alternative reinforcer (leisure activity), and to money, before and after weight restoration in an inpatient population with anorexia nervosa (AN). Sixty-two inpatients with AN completed a progressive ratio (PR) task to earn exercise, leisure activities, or cash at low weight and after weight restoration. Measures of pathology and motivation to exercise were completed and post-treatment discharge weights were collected. Patients worked harder for exercise at low weight than after weight restoration (df\u00a0=\u00a046, t\u00a0=\u00a05.50, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). PR task performance was weakly associated with a measure of commitment to exercise (low weight: r\u00a0=\u00a00.31, weight restored: r\u00a0=\u00a00.36, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), but not with other clinical measures or follow-up weights. Contrary to prior suggestions, measurement of the reinforcing value of exercise among individuals with AN via a PR task does not appear valuable in assessing clinical severity or outcome. Other, simpler, self-report measures of commitment to exercise may have greater value in assessing these outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "We propose a Multiple Imputation Random Lasso (mirl) method to select important variables and to predict the outcome for an epidemiological study of Eating and Activity in Teens. In this study 80% of individuals have at least one variable missing. Therefore, using variable selection methods developed for complete data after listwise deletion substantially reduces prediction power. Recent work on prediction models in the presence of incomplete data cannot adequately account for large numbers of variables with arbitrary missing patterns. We propose MIRL to combine penalized regression techniques with multiple imputation and stability selection. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to compare MIRL with several alternatives. MIRL outperforms other methods in high-dimensional scenarios in terms of both reduced prediction error and improved variable selection performance, and it has greater advantage when the correlation among variables is high and missing proportion is high. MIRL is shown to have improved performance when comparing with other applicable methods when applied to the study of Eating and Activity in Teens for the boys and girls separately, and to a subgroup of low social economic status (ses) Asian boys who are at high risk of developing obesity.",

        "Abstract": "With an increasing number of causal genes discovered for complex human disorders, it is crucial to assess the genetic risk of disease onset for individuals who are carriers of these causal mutations and compare the distribution of age-at-onset with that in non-carriers. In many genetic epidemiological studies aiming at estimating causal gene effect on disease, the age-at-onset of disease is subject to censoring. In addition, some individuals' mutation carrier or non-carrier status can be unknown due to the high cost of in-person ascertainment to collect DNA samples or death in older individuals. Instead, the probability of these individuals' mutation status can be obtained from various sources. When mutation status is missing, the available data take the form of censored mixture data. Recently, various methods have been proposed for risk estimation from such data, but none is efficient for estimating a nonparametric distribution. We propose a fully efficient sieve maximum likelihood estimation method, in which we estimate the logarithm of the hazard ratio between genetic mutation groups using B-splines, while applying nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation for the reference baseline hazard function. Our estimator can be calculated via an expectation-maximization algorithm which is much faster than existing methods. We show that our estimator is consistent and semiparametrically efficient and establish its asymptotic distribution. Simulation studies demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method, which is applied to the estimation of the distribution of the age-at-onset of Parkinson's disease for carriers of mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene.",

        "Abstract": "We propose a generalized partially linear functional single index risk score model for repeatedly measured outcomes where the index itself is a function of time. We fuse the nonparametric kernel method and regression spline method, and modify the generalized estimating equation to facilitate estimation and inference. We use local smoothing kernel to estimate the unspecified coefficient functions of time, and use B-splines to estimate the unspecified function of the single index component. The covariance structure is taken into account via a working model, which provides valid estimation and inference procedure whether or not it captures the true covariance. The estimation method is applicable to both continuous and discrete outcomes. We derive large sample properties of the estimation procedure and show different convergence rate of each component of the model. The asymptotic properties when the kernel and regression spline methods are combined in a nested fashion has not been studied prior to this work even in the independent data case.",

        "Title": "Multiple kernel learning with random effects for predicting longitudinal outcomes and data integration.",
        "Abstract": "Predicting disease risk and progression is one of the main goals in many clinical research studies. Cohort studies on the natural history and etiology of chronic diseases span years and data are collected at multiple visits. Although, kernel-based statistical learning methods are proven to be powerful for a wide range of disease prediction problems, these methods are only well studied for independent data, but not for longitudinal data. It is thus important to develop time-sensitive prediction rules that make use of the longitudinal nature of the data. In this paper, we develop a novel statistical learning method for longitudinal data by introducing subject-specific short-term and long-term latent effects through a designed kernel to account for within-subject correlation of longitudinal measurements. Since the presence of multiple sources of data is increasingly common, we embed our method in a multiple kernel learning framework and propose a regularized multiple kernel statistical learning with random effects to construct effective nonparametric prediction rules. Our method allows easy integration of various heterogeneous data sources and takes advantage of correlation among longitudinal measures to increase prediction power. We use different kernels for each data source taking advantage of the distinctive feature of each data modality, and then optimally combine data across modalities. We apply the developed methods to two large epidemiological studies, one on Huntington's disease and the other on Alzheimer's Disease (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI) where we explore a unique opportunity to combine imaging and genetic data to study prediction of mild cognitive impairment, and show a substantial gain in performance while accounting for the longitudinal aspect of the data.",

Sixty-five individuals across two sites were enrolled and received services for up to 2 years. Trajectories for individuals' outcomes over time were examined using linear and quadratic mixed-effects models with repeated measures. In addition, baseline prognostic factors of participant improvement in social and occupational functioning were explored based on previous literature and expert opinion of the analytic team. Results demonstrate that the program was effective in improving quality of life and recovery over time. Furthermore, processing speed was identified as a significant moderator of improvement in occupational Global Assessment of Function, and treatment fidelity, engagement, and family involvement were identified as mediators of improvement in social and occupational functioning.",

We use a nonparametric function for the coefficient of the time-varying effect and handle censoring through self-consistency equations that redistribute the probability mass of censored outcomes to the right. The computational procedure is extremely convenient and can be implemented by standard software. We prove large sample properties of the proposed estimator and evaluate its finite sample performance through simulation studies. We apply the method to estimate the cumulative risk of developing Huntington's disease (HD) from subjects with huntingtin gene mutation using a large collaborative HD study data and illustrate an inverse relationship between the cumulative risk of HD and the length of cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats in the huntingtin gene.",

        "Abstract": "This paper analyses the food waste collection and transportation (C&T) system in a pilot project in Suzhou by using a novel performance evaluation method. The method employed to conduct this analysis involves a unified performance evaluation index containing qualitative and quantitative indicators applied to data from Suzhou City. Two major inefficiencies were identified: a) low system efficiency due to insufficient processing capacity of commercial food waste facilities; and b) low waste resource utilization due to low efficiency of manual sorting. The performance evaluation indicated that the pilot project collection system's strong points included strong economics, low environmental impact and low social impact. This study also shows that Suzhou's integrated system has developed a comprehensive body of laws and clarified regulatory responsibilities for each of the various government departments to solve the problems of commercial food waste management. Based on Suzhou's experience, perspectives and lessons can be drawn for other cities and areas where food waste management systems are in the planning stage, or are encountering operational problems.",

        "Abstract": "Dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) are sequential decision rules tailored at each point where a clinical decision is made based on each patient's time-varying characteristics and intermediate outcomes observed at earlier points in time. The complexity, patient heterogeneity, and chronicity of mental disorders call for learning optimal DTRs to dynamically adapt treatment to an individual's response over time. The Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMARTs) design allows for estimating causal effects of DTRs. Modern statistical tools have been developed to optimize DTRs based on personalized variables and intermediate outcomes using rich data collected from SMARTs; these statistical methods can also be used to recommend tailoring variables for designing future SMART studies. This paper introduces DTRs and SMARTs using two examples in mental health studies, discusses two machine learning methods for estimating optimal DTR from SMARTs data, and demonstrates the performance of the statistical methods using simulated data.",

        "Abstract": "In certain genetic studies, clinicians and genetic counselors are interested in estimating the cumulative risk of a disease for individuals with and without a rare deleterious mutation. Estimating the cumulative risk is difficult, however, when the estimates are based on family history data. Often, the genetic mutation status in many family members is unknown; instead, only estimated probabilities of a patient having a certain mutation status are available. Also, ages of disease-onset are subject to right censoring. Existing methods to estimate the cumulative risk using such family-based data only provide estimation at individual time points, and are not guaranteed to be monotonic, nor non-negative. In this paper, we develop a novel method that combines Expectation-Maximization and isotonic regression to estimate the cumulative risk across the entire support. Our estimator is monotonic, satisfies self-consistent estimating equations, and has high power in detecting differences between the cumulative risks of different populations. Application of our estimator to a Parkinson's disease (PD) study provides the age-at-onset distribution of PD in PARK2 mutation carriers and non-carriers, and reveals a significant difference between the distribution in compound heterozygous carriers compared to non-carriers, but not between heterozygous carriers and non-carriers.",

        "Abstract": "We develop methods to accurately predict whether pre-symptomatic individuals are at risk of a disease based on their various marker profiles, which offers an opportunity for early intervention well before definitive clinical diagnosis. For many diseases, existing clinical literature may suggest the risk of disease varies with some markers of biological and etiological importance, for example age. To identify effective prediction rules using nonparametric decision functions, standard statistical learning approaches treat markers with clear biological importance (e.g., age) and other markers without prior knowledge on disease etiology interchangeably as input variables. Therefore, these approaches may be inadequate in singling out and preserving the effects from the biologically important variables, especially in the presence of potential noise markers. Using age as an example of a salient marker to receive special care in the analysis, we propose a local smoothing large margin classifier implemented with support vector machine (SVM) to construct effective age-dependent classification rules. The method adaptively adjusts age effect and separately tunes age and other markers to achieve optimal performance. We derive the asymptotic risk bound of the local smoothing SVM, and perform extensive simulation studies to compare with standard approaches. We apply the proposed method to two studies of premanifest Huntington's disease (HD) subjects and controls to construct age-sensitive predictive scores for the risk of HD and risk of receiving HD diagnosis during the study period.",

More recently, efforts have been made to incorporate such technologies into outpatient treatments. However, few attempts have been made to date to employ such mobile devices among hospitalized psychiatric patients. In this article, we evaluate the potential use of such devices in inpatient psychiatric settings using 33 hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Employing an Experience Sampling Method approach, we provide support for the feasibility of using such devices, along with examples of potentially clinically-relevant information that can be obtained using such technologies, including assessment of fluctuations in the severity of psychotic symptoms and negative mood in relation to social context, unit location, and time of day. Following these examples, we discuss issues related to the potential use of mobile electronic devices by patients hospitalized at inpatient psychiatric settings including issues related to patients' compliance, assessment schedules, questionnaire development, confidentiality issues, as well as selection of appropriate software/hardware. Finally, we delineate some issues and areas of inquiry requiring additional research and development.",

        "Title": "A marginal approach to reduced-rank penalized spline smoothing with application to multilevel functional data.",
        "Abstract": "Multilevel functional data is collected in many biomedical studies. For example, in a study of the effect of Nimodipine on patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), patients underwent multiple 4-hour treatment cycles. Within each treatment cycle, subjects' vital signs were reported every 10 minutes. This data has a natural multilevel structure with treatment cycles nested within subjects and measurements nested within cycles. Most literature on nonparametric analysis of such multilevel functional data focus on conditional approaches using functional mixed effects models. However, parameters obtained from the conditional models do not have direct interpretations as population average effects. When population effects are of interest, we may employ marginal regression models. In this work, we propose marginal approaches to fit multilevel functional data through penalized spline generalized estimating equation (penalized spline GEE). The procedure is effective for modeling multilevel correlated generalized outcomes as well as continuous outcomes without suffering from numerical difficulties. We provide a variance estimator robust to misspecification of correlation structure. We investigate the large sample properties of the penalized spline GEE estimator with multilevel continuous data and show that the asymptotics falls into two categories. In the small knots scenario, the estimated mean function is asymptotically efficient when the true correlation function is used and the asymptotic bias does not depend on the working correlation matrix. In the large knots scenario, both the asymptotic bias and variance depend on the working correlation. We propose a new method to select the smoothing parameter for penalized spline GEE based on an estimate of the asymptotic mean squared error (MSE). We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine property of the proposed estimator under different correlation structures and sensitivity of the variance estimation to the choice of smoothing parameter. Finally, we apply the methods to the SAH study to evaluate a recent debate on discontinuing the use of Nimodipine in the clinical community.",

        "Title": "Auxiliary marker-assisted classification in the absence of class identifiers.",
        "Abstract": "Constructing classification rules for accurate diagnosis of a disorder is an important goal in medical practice. In many clinical applications, there is no clinically significant anatomical or physiological deviation exists to identify the gold standard disease status to inform development of classification algorithms. Despite absence of perfect disease class identifiers, there are usually one or more disease-informative auxiliary markers along with feature variables comprising known symptoms. Existing statistical learning approaches do not effectively draw information from auxiliary prognostic markers. We propose a large margin classification method, with particular emphasis on the support vector machine (SVM), assisted by available informative markers in order to classify disease without knowing a subject's true disease status. We view this task as statistical learning in the presence of missing data, and introduce a pseudo-EM algorithm to the classification. A major distinction with a regular EM algorithm is that we do not model the distribution of missing data given the observed feature variables either parametrically or semiparametrically. We also propose a sparse variable selection method embedded in the pseudo-EM algorithm. Theoretical examination shows that the proposed classification rule is Fisher consistent, and that under a linear rule, the proposed selection has an oracle variable selection property and the estimated coefficients are asymptotically normal. We apply the methods to build decision rules for including subjects in clinical trials of a new psychiatric disorder and present four applications to data available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.",

        "Abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a dominant genetic mode of inheritance caused by an expansion of CAG repeats on chromosome 4. Typically, a longer sequence of CAG repeat length is associated with increased risk of experiencing earlier onset of HD. Previous studies of the association between HD onset age and CAG length have favored a logistic model, where the CAG repeat length enters the mean and variance components of the logistic model in a complex exponential-linear form. To relax the parametric assumption of the exponential-linear association to the true HD onset distribution, we propose to leave both mean and variance functions of the CAG repeat length unspecified and perform semiparametric estimation in this context through a local kernel and backfitting procedure. Motivated by including family history of HD information available in the family members of participants in the Cooperative Huntington's Observational Research Trial (COHORT), we develop the methodology in the context of mixture data, where some subjects have a positive probability of being risk free. We also allow censoring on the age at onset of disease and accommodate covariates other than the CAG length. We study the theoretical properties of the proposed estimator and derive its asymptotic distribution. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to the COHORT data to estimate the HD onset distribution using a group of study participants and the disease family history information available on their family members.",

        "Abstract": "We examine a generalized F-test of a nonparametric function through penalized splines and a linear mixed effects model representation. With a mixed effects model representation of penalized splines, we imbed the test of an unspecified function into a test of some fixed effects and a variance component in a linear mixed effects model with nuisance variance components under the null. The procedure can be used to test a nonparametric function or varying-coefficient with clustered data, compare two spline functions, test the significance of an unspecified function in an additive model with multiple components, and test a row or a column effect in a two-way analysis of variance model. Through a spectral decomposition of the residual sum of squares, we provide a fast algorithm for computing the null distribution of the test, which significantly improves the computational efficiency over bootstrap. The spectral representation reveals a connection between the likelihood ratio test (LRT) in a multiple variance components model and a single component model. We examine our methods through simulations, where we show that the power of the generalized F-test may be higher than the LRT, depending on the hypothesis of interest and the true model under the alternative. We apply these methods to compute the genome-wide critical value and p-value of a genetic association test in a genome-wide association study (GWAS), where the usual bootstrap is computationally intensive (up to 10(8) simulations) and asymptotic approximation may be unreliable and conservative.",

        "Abstract": "Longitudinal genetic studies provide a valuable resource for exploring key genetic and environmental factors that affect complex traits over time. Genetic analysis of longitudinal data that incorporate temporal variations is important for understanding genetic architecture and biological variations of common complex diseases. Although they are important, there is a paucity of statistical methods to analyze longitudinal human genetic data. In this article, longitudinal methods are developed for temporal association mapping to analyze population longitudinal data. Both parametric and nonparametric models are proposed. The models can be applied to multiple diallelic genetic markers such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms and multiallelic markers such as microsatellites. By analytical formulae, we show that the models take both the linkage disequilibrium and temporal trends into account simultaneously. Variance-covariance structure is constructed to model the single measurement variation and multiple measurement correlations of an individual based on the theory of stochastic processes. Novel penalized spline models are used to estimate the time-dependent mean functions and regression coefficients. The methods were applied to analyze Framingham Heart Study data of Genetic Analysis Workshop (GAW) 13 and GAW 16. The temporal trends and genetic effects of the systolic blood pressure are successfully detected by the proposed approaches. Simulation studies were performed to find out that the nonparametric penalized linear model is the best choice in fitting real data. The research sheds light on the important area of longitudinal genetic analysis, and it provides a basis for future methodological investigations and practical applications.",

        "Abstract": "In family-based longitudinal genetic studies, investigators collect repeated measurements on a trait that changes with time along with genetic markers. Since repeated measurements are nested within subjects and subjects are nested within families, both the subject-level and measurement-level correlations must be taken into account in the statistical analysis to achieve more accurate estimation. In such studies, the primary interests include to test for quantitative trait locus (QTL) effect, and to estimate age-specific QTL effect and residual polygenic heritability function. We propose flexible semiparametric models along with their statistical estimation and hypothesis testing procedures for longitudinal genetic designs. We employ penalized splines to estimate nonparametric functions in the models. We find that misspecifying the baseline function or the genetic effect function in a parametric analysis may lead to substantially inflated or highly conservative type I error rate on testing and large mean squared error on estimation. We apply the proposed approaches to examine age-specific effects of genetic variants reported in a recent genome-wide association study of blood pressure collected in the Framingham Heart Study.",

Multivariate phenotypes are frequently encountered in genetic association studies. The purpose of analyzing multivariate phenotypes usually includes discovery of novel genetic variants of pleiotropy effects, that is, affecting multiple phenotypes, and the ultimate goal of uncovering the underlying genetic mechanism. In recent years, there have been new method development and application of existing statistical methods to such phenotypes. In this paper, we provide a review of the available methods for analyzing association between a single marker and a multivariate phenotype consisting of the same type of components (e.g., all continuous or all categorical) or different types of components (e.g., some are continuous and others are categorical). We also reviewed causal inference methods designed to test whether the detected association with the multivariate phenotype is truly pleiotropy or the genetic marker exerts its effects on some phenotypes through affecting the others.",

        "Abstract": "For many complex traits, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) only explain a small percentage of heritability. Next generation sequencing technology makes it possible to explore unexplained heritability by identifying rare variants (RVs). Existing tests designed for RVs look for optimal strategies to combine information across multiple variants. Many of the tests have good power when the true underlying associations are either in the same direction or in opposite directions. We propose three tests for examining the association between a phenotype and RVs, where two of them jointly consider the common association across RVs and the individual deviations from the common effect. On one hand, similar to some of the best existing methods, the individual deviations are modeled as random effects to borrow information across multiple RVs. On the other hand, unlike the existing methods which pool individual effects towards zero, we pool them towards a possibly non-zero common effect by adding a pooled variant into the model. The common effect and the individual effects are jointly tested. We show through extensive simulations that at least one of the three tests proposed here is the most powerful or very close to being the most powerful in various settings of true models. This is appealing in practice because the direction and size of the true effects of the associated RVs are unknown. Researchers can apply the developed tests to improve power under a wide range of true models.",

        "Abstract": "This work presents methods for estimating genotype-specific distributions from genetic epidemiology studies where the event times are subject to right censoring, the genotypes are not directly observed, and the data arise from a mixture of scientifically meaningful subpopulations. Examples of such studies include kin-cohort studies and quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies. Current methods for analyzing censored mixture data include two types of nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators (NPMLEs) which do not make parametric assumptions on the genotype-specific density functions. Although both NPMLEs are commonly used, we show that one is inefficient and the other inconsistent. To overcome these deficiencies, we propose three classes of consistent nonparametric estimators which do not assume parametric density models and are easy to implement. They are based on the inverse probability weighting (IPW), augmented IPW (AIPW), and nonparametric imputation (IMP). The AIPW achieves the efficiency bound without additional modeling assumptions. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate satisfactory performance of these estimators even when the data are heavily censored. We apply these estimators to the Cooperative Huntington's Observational Research Trial (COHORT), and provide age-specific estimates of the effect of mutation in the Huntington gene on mortality using a sample of family members. The close approximation of the estimated non-carrier survival rates to that of the U.S. population indicates small ascertainment bias in the COHORT family sample. Our analyses underscore an elevated risk of death in Huntington gene mutation carriers compared to non-carriers for a wide age range, and suggest that the mutation equally affects survival rates in both genders. The estimated survival rates are useful in genetic counseling for providing guidelines on interpreting the risk of death associated with a positive genetic testing, and in facilitating future subjects at risk to make informed decisions on whether to undergo genetic mutation testings.",

        "Abstract": "We study efficient nonparametric estimation of distribution functions of several scientifically meaningful sub-populations from data consisting of mixed samples where the sub-population identifiers are missing. Only probabilities of each observation belonging to a sub-population are available. The problem arises from several biomedical studies such as quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and genetic studies with ungenotyped relatives where the scientific interest lies in estimating the cumulative distribution function of a trait given a specific genotype. However, in these studies subjects' genotypes may not be directly observed. The distribution of the trait outcome is therefore a mixture of several genotype-specific distributions. We characterize the complete class of consistent estimators which includes members such as one type of nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) and least squares or weighted least squares estimators. We identify the efficient estimator in the class that reaches the semiparametric efficiency bound, and we implement it using a simple procedure that remains consistent even if several components of the estimator are mis-specified. In addition, our close inspections on two commonly used NPMLEs in these problems show the surprising results that the NPMLE in one form is highly inefficient, while in the other form is inconsistent. We provide simulation procedures to illustrate the theoretical results and demonstrate the proposed methods through two real data examples.",

        "Abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the IT15 gene. The age-at-onset (AAO) of HD is inversely related to the CAG repeat length and the minimum length thought to cause HD is 36. Accurate estimation of the AAO distribution based on CAG repeat length is important for genetic counseling and the design of clinical trials. In the Cooperative Huntington's Observational Research Trial (COHORT) study, the CAG repeat length is known for the proband participants. However, whether a family member shares the huntingtin gene status (CAG expanded or not) with the proband is unknown. In this work, we use the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to handle the missing huntingtin gene information in first-degree family members in COHORT, assuming that a family member has the same CAG length as the proband if the family member carries a huntingtin gene mutation. We perform simulation studies to examine performance of the proposed method and apply the methods to analyze COHORT proband and family combined data. Our analyses reveal that the estimated cumulative risk of HD symptom onset obtained from the combined data is slightly lower than the risk estimated from the proband data alone.",

Observations on subjects from the same family are correlated due to shared genetic composition or environmental factors such as diet. The data have a 3-level structure with measurements nested in subjects and subjects nested in families. We propose a semiparametric variance components model to describe phenotype observed at a time point as the sum of a nonparametric population mean function, a nonparametric random quantitative trait locus (QTL) effect, a shared environmental effect, a residual random polygenic effect and measurement error. One feature of the model is that we do not assume a parametric functional form of the age-dependent QTL effect, and we use penalized spline-based method to fit the model. We obtain nonparametric estimation of the QTL heritability defined as the ratio of the QTL variance to the total phenotypic variance. We use simulation studies to investigate performance of the proposed methods and apply these methods to the FHS systolic blood pressure data to estimate age-specific QTL effect at 62cM on chromosome 17.",

        "Abstract": "In many clinical settings, a commonly encountered problem is to assess the accuracy of a screening test for early detection of a disease. In this article, we develop hierarchical all-subset variable selection methods to assess and improve a psychosis screening test designed to detect psychotic patients in primary care clinics. We select items from an existing screener to achieve best prediction accuracy based on a gold standard psychosis status diagnosis. The existing screener has a hierarchical structure: the questions fall into five domains, and there is a root question followed by several stem questions in each domain. The statistical question lies in how to implement the hierarchical structure in the screening items when performing variable selection such that when a stem question is selected in the screener, its root question should also be selected. We develop an all-subset variable selection procedure that takes into account the hierarchical structure in a questionnaire. By enforcing a hierarchical rule, we reduce the dimensionality of the search space, thereby allowing for fast all-subset selection, which is usually computationally prohibitive. To focus on prediction performance of a selected model, we use area under the ROC curve as the criterion to rank all admissible models. We compare the procedure to a logistic regression-based approach and a stepwise regression that ignores the hierarchical structure. We use the procedure to construct a psychosis screening test to be used at a primary care clinic that will optimally screen low-income, Latino psychotic patients for further specialty referral.",

        "Abstract": "Longitudinal data are routinely collected in biomedical research studies. A natural model describing longitudinal data decomposes an individual's outcome as the sum of a population mean function and random subject-specific deviations. When parametric assumptions are too restrictive, methods modeling the population mean function and the random subject-specific functions nonparametrically are in demand. In some applications, it is desirable to estimate a covariance function of random subject-specific deviations. In this work, flexible yet computationally efficient methods are developed for a general class of semiparametric mixed effects models, where the functional forms of the population mean and the subject-specific curves are unspecified. We estimate nonparametric components of the model by penalized spline (P-spline, Biometrics 2001; 57:253-259), and reparameterize the random curve covariance function by a modified Cholesky decomposition (Biometrics 2002; 58:121-128) which allows for unconstrained estimation of a positive-semidefinite matrix. To provide smooth estimates, we penalize roughness of fitted curves and derive closed-form solutions in the maximization step of an EM algorithm. In addition, we present models and methods for longitudinal family data where subjects in a family are correlated and we decompose the covariance function into a subject-level source and observation-level source. We apply these methods to the multi-level Framingham Heart Study data to estimate age-specific heritability of systolic blood pressure nonparametrically.",

        "Title": "Prediction-based structured variable selection through the receiver operating characteristic curves.",
        "Abstract": "In many clinical settings, a commonly encountered problem is to assess accuracy of a screening test for early detection of a disease. In these applications, predictive performance of the test is of interest. Variable selection may be useful in designing a medical test. An example is a research study conducted to design a new screening test by selecting variables from an existing screener with a hierarchical structure among variables: there are several root questions followed by their stem questions. The stem questions will only be asked after a subject has answered the root question. It is therefore unreasonable to select a model that only contains stem variables but not its root variable. In this work, we propose methods to perform variable selection with structured variables when predictive accuracy of a diagnostic test is the main concern of the analysis. We take a linear combination of individual variables to form a combined test. We then maximize a direct summary measure of the predictive performance of the test, the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC of an ROC), subject to a penalty function to control for overfitting. Since maximizing empirical AUC of the ROC of a combined test is a complicated nonconvex problem (Pepe, Cai, and Longton, 2006, Biometrics62, 221-229), we explore the connection between the empirical AUC and a support vector machine (SVM). We cast the problem of maximizing predictive performance of a combined test as a penalized SVM problem and apply a reparametrization to impose the hierarchical structure among variables. We also describe a penalized logistic regression variable selection procedure for structured variables and compare it with the ROC-based approaches. We use simulation studies based on real data to examine performance of the proposed methods. Finally we apply developed methods to design a structured screener to be used in primary care clinics to refer potentially psychotic patients for further specialty diagnostics and treatment.",

        "Abstract": "In this article, we propose penalized spline (P-spline)-based methods for functional mixed effects models with varying coefficients. We decompose longitudinal outcomes as a sum of several terms: a population mean function, covariates with time-varying coefficients, functional subject-specific random effects, and residual measurement error processes. Using P-splines, we propose nonparametric estimation of the population mean function, varying coefficient, random subject-specific curves, and the associated covariance function that represents between-subject variation and the variance function of the residual measurement errors which represents within-subject variation. Proposed methods offer flexible estimation of both the population- and subject-level curves. In addition, decomposing variability of the outcomes as a between- and within-subject source is useful in identifying the dominant variance component therefore optimally model a covariance function. We use a likelihood-based method to select multiple smoothing parameters. Furthermore, we study the asymptotics of the baseline P-spline estimator with longitudinal data. We conduct simulation studies to investigate performance of the proposed methods. The benefit of the between- and within-subject covariance decomposition is illustrated through an analysis of Berkeley growth data, where we identified clearly distinct patterns of the between- and within-subject covariance functions of children's heights. We also apply the proposed methods to estimate the effect of antihypertensive treatment from the Framingham Heart Study data.",

        "Abstract": "Exposure and response prevention (EX/RP) is an efficacious treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, patients often do not adhere fully to EX/RP procedures. Motivational interviewing (MI) has been shown to improve treatment adherence in other disorders. This pilot study used a randomized controlled design to examine whether MI can be successfully added to EX/RP and whether this intervention (EX/RP+MI) could improve patient adherence to between-session EX/RP procedures relative to EX/RP alone. Thirty adults with OCD were randomized to 18 sessions of EX/RP or EX/RP+MI. Therapists rated patient adherence at each exposure session. Independent evaluators assessed change in OCD and depressive symptoms, and patients completed self-report measures of readiness for change and quality of life. The two treatment conditions differed in degree of congruence with MI but not in conduct of EX/RP procedures. Both groups experienced clinically significant improvement in OCD symptoms, without significant group differences in patient adherence. There are several possible reasons why EX/RP+MI had no effect on patient adherence compared to standard EX/RP, each of which has important implications for the design of future MI studies in OCD. We recommend that MI be further evaluated in OCD by exploring alternative modes of delivery and by focusing on patients less ready for change than the current sample.",

        "Abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious mental illness characterized by reduced caloric intake that often persists after acute weight restoration. This preliminary study assesses the relationship between pre-meal anxiety and food intake in recently weight-restored individuals with AN. We hypothesized that pre-meal anxiety is inversely related to caloric intake in AN. Caloric intake and pre-meal anxiety were measured in three laboratory-based assessments (yogurt snack, multi-item lunch, macaroni and cheese lunch). Anxiety was measured by Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) administered prior to the meal. Acutely weight-restored patients with AN were compared with healthy controls (HCs). Associations between anxiety and intake were analyzed first within each meal type separately and then using a model to combine the sample. In the multi-item lunch and the macaroni and cheese lunch, AN ate significantly less than HC (p=0.01, p<0.001). Pre-meal anxiety was significantly correlated with intake among AN, but not HC. In the yogurt snack, there was no significant association between anxiety and intake among patients or controls, and the groups did not differ in caloric intake. The association between pre-meal anxiety and intake among weight-restored individuals with AN suggests a potential target for relapse prevention treatment.",

        "Title": "Unbiased and locally efficient estimation of genetic effect on quantitative trait in the presence of population admixture.",
        "Abstract": "Population admixture can be a confounding factor in genetic association studies. Family-based methods (Rabinowitz and Larid, 2000, Human Heredity 50, 211-223) have been proposed in both testing and estimation settings to adjust for this confounding, especially in case-only association studies. The family-based methods rely on conditioning on the observed parental genotypes or on the minimal sufficient statistic for the genetic model under the null hypothesis. In some cases, these methods do not capture all the available information due to the conditioning strategy being too stringent. General efficient methods to adjust for population admixture that use all the available information have been proposed (Rabinowitz, 2002,\u2002Journal of the American Statistical Association 92, 742-758). However these approaches may not be easy to implement in some situations. A previously developed easy-to-compute approach adjusts for admixture by adding supplemental covariates to linear models (Yang et al., 2000, Human Heredity 50, 227-233). Here is shown that this augmenting linear model with appropriate covariates strategy can be combined with the general efficient methods in Rabinowitz (2002) to provide computationally tractable and locally efficient adjustment. After deriving the optimal covariates, the adjusted analysis can be carried out using standard statistical software packages such as SAS or R. The proposed methods enjoy a local efficiency in a neighborhood of the true model. The simulation studies show that nontrivial efficiency gains can be obtained by using information not accessible to the methods that rely on conditioning on the minimal sufficient statistics. The approaches are illustrated through an analysis of the influence of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype on plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration in children.",

        "Title": "Armitage's trend test for genome-wide association analysis: one-sided or two-sided?",
        "Abstract": "The importance of considering confounding due to population stratification in genome-wide association analysis using case-control designs has been a source of debate. Armitage's trend test, together with some other methods developed from it, can correct for population stratification to some extent. However, there is a question whether the one-sided or the two-sided alternative hypothesis is appropriate, or to put it another way, whether examining both the one-sided and the two-sided alternative hypotheses can give more information. The dataset for Problem 1 of Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 provides us with a chance to address this question. Because it is a part of a combined sample from the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) and the Swedish Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (EIRA), the results from the combined sample can be used as references. To test this aim, the last 10,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 9, which contain the common genetic variant at the TRAF1-C5 locus, were examined by conducting Armitage's trend tests. Examining the two-sided alternative hypothesis shows that SNPs rs12380341 (p = 9.7 x 10-11) and rs872863 (p = 1.7 x 10-15), along with six SNPs across the TRAF1-C5 locus, rs1953126, rs10985073, rs881375, rs3761847, rs10760130, and rs2900180 (p~1 x 10-7), are significantly associated with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide-positive rheumatoid arthritis. But examining the one-sided alternative hypothesis that the minor allele is positively associated with the disease shows that only those six SNPs across the TRAF1-C5 locus are significantly associated with the disease (p~1 x 10-8), which is consistent with the results from the combined sample of the NARAC and the EIRA.",

        "Abstract": "Single-locus analysis is often used to analyze genome-wide association (GWA) data, but such analysis is subject to severe multiple comparisons adjustment. Multivariate logistic regression is proposed to fit a multi-locus model for case-control data. However, when the sample size is much smaller than the number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or when correlation among SNPs is high, traditional multivariate logistic regression breaks down. To accommodate the scale of data from a GWA while controlling for collinearity and overfitting in a high dimensional predictor space, we propose a variable selection procedure using Bayesian logistic regression. We explored a connection between Bayesian regression with certain priors and L1 and L2 penalized logistic regression. After analyzing large number of SNPs simultaneously in a Bayesian regression, we selected important SNPs for further consideration. With much fewer SNPs of interest, problems of multiple comparisons and collinearity are less severe. We conducted simulation studies to examine probability of correctly selecting disease contributing SNPs and applied developed methods to analyze Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium data.",

        "Abstract": "In a genetic epidemiology study of a trait, prior to collecting genotype data the foremost task is to test for familial aggregation and examine heritability. Recently, functional traits have drawn attentions from investigators. Here, to test for familial aggregation of a functional trait in the family studies, a test constructed based on the leading functional principal component of heritability, which is a summary measure of temporal genetic variation in a functional trait, is proposed. The p-value of the test can be approximated by a permutation procedure given the family structure. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is derived. Simulations are carried out to examine the size and the power of the test. The proposed methods are applied to the total cholesterol data in the Framingham Heart Study.",

        "Abstract": "Longitudinal studies examining associations of the inflammatory markers fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (CRP) with lung function decline are sparse. The authors examined whether elevated fibrinogen and CRP levels were associated with greater longitudinal lung function decline in the elderly. The Cardiovascular Health Study measured fibrinogen and CRP in 5,790 Whites and African Americans from four US communities aged 65 years or older in 1989-1990 or 1992-1993. Spirometry was performed in 1989-1990 and 4, 7, and 16 years later. Fibrinogen and CRP were inversely associated with lung function at baseline after adjustment for multiple potential confounders. In mixed models, the rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1))/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio with increasing age was faster among those with higher baseline fibrinogen (-0.032%/year per standard deviation higher fibrinogen (95% confidence interval: -0.057, -0.0074)) but not among those with higher CRP (-0.0037%/year per standard deviation higher CRP (95% confidence interval: -0.013, 0.0056)). Longitudinal analyses for FEV(1) and FVC yielded results in the direction opposite of that hypothesized, possibly because of the high mortality rate and strong inverse association of FEV(1) and FVC but not FEV(1)/FVC with mortality. An alternative approach to missing data yielded similar results. In conclusion, higher levels of fibrinogen, but not CRP, independently predicted greater FEV(1)/FVC decline in the elderly.",

It has been common to consider the existence of hot spots as evidence for master regulation of gene expression. However, hot spots could also simply be due to highly correlated gene expressions or linkage disequilibrium and do not truly represent master regulators. A recent simulation study using real human gene expression data but simulated random single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypes showed patterns of clustering of expression quantitative trait loci that resemble those in actual studies [Perez-Enciso: Genetics 2004, 166: 547-554.].

        "Abstract": "When the number of phenotypes in a genetic study is on the scale of thousands, such as in studies concerning thousands of gene expression levels, the single-trait analysis is computationally intensive, and heavy adjustment of multiple comparisons is required. Traditional multivariate genetic linkage analysis for quantitative traits focuses on mapping only a few phenotypes and is not feasible for a large number of traits. To cope with high-dimensional phenotype data, clustering analysis and principal-component analysis (PCA) are proposed to reduce the data dimensionality and to map shared genetic contributions for multiple traits. However, standard clustering analysis and PCA are applicable for independent observations. In most genetic studies, where family data are collected, these standard analyses can only be applied to founders and can lead to the loss of information. Here, we proposed a clustering method that can exploit family structure information and applied the method to 29 gene expression levels mapped to a reported hot spot on chromosome 14. We then used a PCA approach based on heritability applicable to small number of traits to combine phenotypes in the clusters. Lastly, we used a penalized PCA approach based on heritability applicable to arbitrary number of traits to combine 150 gene expression levels with the highest heritability. Genome-wide multipoint linkage analysis was carried out on the individual traits and on the combined traits. Two previously reported peaks on chromosomes 14 and 20 were identified. Linkage evidence was stronger for traits derived from methods that incorporate family structure information.",

        "Abstract": "This paper summarizes contributions to group 12 of the 15th Genetic Analysis Workshop. The papers in this group focused on multivariate methods and applications for the analysis of molecular data including genotypic data as well as gene expression microarray measurements and clinical phenotypes. A range of multivariate techniques have been employed to extract signals from the multi-feature data sets that were provided by the workshop organizers. The methods included data reduction techniques such as principal component analysis and cluster analysis; latent variable models including structural equations and item response modeling; joint multivariate modeling techniques as well as multivariate visualization tools. This summary paper categorizes and discusses individual contributions with regard to multiple classifications of multivariate methods. Given the wide variety in the data considered, the objectives of the analysis and the methods applied, direct comparison of the results of the various papers is difficult. However, the group was able to make many interesting comparisons and parallels between the various approaches. In summary, there was a consensus among authors in group 12 that the genetic research community should continue to draw experiences from other fields such as statistics, econometrics, chemometrics, computer science and linear systems theory.",

        "Title": "No effect of cigarette smoking dose on oxidized plasma proteins.",
        "Abstract": "Cigarette smoking is a major source of oxidative stress. Protein carbonyls have been used as a biomarker of oxidative stress because of the relative stability of carbonylated proteins and the high protein concentration in blood. Increased levels of carbonyl groups have been found in serum proteins of smokers compared to nonsmokers. However, neither the dose effect of current cigarette smoke nor other predictors of oxidative stress have been studied. Hence, we used an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to evaluate plasma protein carbonyls in smokers recruited in the Early Lung Cancer Action Project (ELCAP) program. The lung cancer screening program enrolled current and former smokers age 60 years and over without a prior cancer diagnosis. A total of 542 participants (282 men and 260 women) completed a baseline questionnaire and provided blood samples for the biomarker study. Protein oxidation was measured by derivatization of the carbonyl groups with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) and ELISA quantitation of the DNPH group. Current smoking status was confirmed with urinary cotinine. The mean (+/-S.D.) protein carbonyl level was 17.9+/-2.9 nmol carbonyl/ml plasma. Protein carbonyls did not differ significantly by gender. Carbonyl levels were higher among current than former smokers, but these differences did not attain statistical significance, nor did differences by urine cotinine levels, pack-years, pack/day among current smokers, and smoking duration. In a multiple regression analysis, higher protein carbonyl levels were independently associated with increasing age (0.59 nmol/ml increase per 10 years, 95% CI 0.14, 1.05, p=0.01), African-American vs. white race/ethnicity, (1.30 nmol/ml, 95% CI 0.4, 2.19, p=0.008), and lower educational attainment (0.75 nmol/ml, 95% CI 0.12, 1.38, p=0.02). Although we found no significant difference between current vs. past cigarette smoking and protein carbonyls in this older group of smokers, associations were found for age, ethnicity, and educational attainment. Our results indicate that the measurement of plasma carbonyls by this ELISA technique is still an easy and suitable method for studies of diseases related to oxidative stress.",

        "Abstract": "We wished to determine whether a screening test battery for cognitive impairment can be given practicably in a busy multidisciplinary ALS clinic, and to assess initial test performance in a sequentially drawn ALS population. We administered a word generation task (letter fluency), the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to 49 ALS patients and their caregivers during a visit to our ALS clinic. We also computed Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale and ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) scores for patients. Pearson correlation coefficients and regression analyses assessed associations between outcome measures. The test battery took 30 min to administer. Word generation was associated with the FBI score (r = -0.36, p = 0.01), and time to ALS diagnosis (p = 0.01). Caregiver depressive symptoms (BDI) correlated with the FBI (r = 0.40, p = 0.005) and motor severity (r = -0.47, p<0.01) in patients. CDR scores were associated with behavioral abnormalities and lower ALSFRS-R scores. We concluded that a screen of cognition could be administered during multidisciplinary ALS clinics. Frontostriatal cognitive impairment may be associated with behavioral syndromes and more rapid forms of ALS. Behavioral and motor impairment is associated with depressive symptoms in caregivers. Studies with formal neuropsychological tests are needed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the screen in ALS.",

        "Abstract": "Although the molecular mechanisms underlying GH secreting pituitary tumor formation are not well understood, mutations in the alpha-subunit of the stimulatory G gene, GNAS, have been identified in up to 40%. As these mutations could play a role in tumor growth, we screened 60 GH secreting tumors for GNAS mutations and assessed whether mutation status correlated with their clinical and pathological characteristics. Tumor specimens obtained at surgery were snap frozen. Tumor DNA was extracted, and PCR was used to amplify regions containing 2 sites of recurrent activating somatic mutations in codons 201 and 227 in GNAS. Amplicons were bi-directionally sequenced and analyzed. GNAS mutations were present in 24/60 (40%) of tumors; these were arg201cys(n = 15), arg201ser(n = 2), arg201his(n = 2), gln227leu(n = 4), gln227arg(n = 1). Preoperative IGF-I levels (age-adjusted) were higher (p = 0.01), but GH levels were slightly higher (p = 0.18) in mutation positive vs. negative groups. Mutation positive tumors were somewhat smaller than negative tumors (p = 0.07). The proportion of tumors >2 cm was somewhat less among positive (8.3%) vs. negative tumors (25%) (p = 0.10). Neither mib proliferation index, the proportion of invasive tumors nor surgical remission rates differed in the groups. IGF-I normalization rate with somatostatin analog therapy was similar in positive (3 of 6) vs. negative (3 of 7) patients. GH secreting tumors harboring GNAS mutations had higher preoperative IGF-I levels, somewhat higher preoperative GH levels and tended to be smaller than tumors without mutations. Presence of a GNAS mutation did not predict a difference in a proliferation marker, surgical remission or response to somatostatin analog therapy.",

        "Abstract": "When a gene variant is discovered to segregate with a disease, it may be of interest to estimate the risk (or the age-specific risk) of the disease to carriers of the variant. The families that contributed to the discovery of the variant would typically contain multiple carriers, and so, especially if the variant is rare, might prove a valuable source of study subjects for estimation of the risk. These families, by virtue of having brought the gene in question to the attention of researchers, however, may not be representative of the relationship between carrier status and the risk of the disease in the population. Using these families for risk estimation could bias the observed association between the variant and the risk. The purpose here is to present an approach to adjusting for the potential bias while using the families from linkage analysis to estimate the risk.",
