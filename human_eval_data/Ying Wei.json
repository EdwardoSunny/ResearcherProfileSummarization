        "Title": "Exploring the value of multiple preprocessors and classifiers in constructing models for predicting microsatellite instability status in colorectal cancer.",
        "Abstract": "Approximately 15% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibit a distinct molecular phenotype known as microsatellite instability (MSI). Accurate and non-invasive prediction of MSI status is crucial for cost savings and guiding clinical treatment strategies. The retrospective study enrolled 307 CRC patients between January 2020 and October 2022. Preoperative images of computed tomography and postoperative status of MSI information were available for analysis. The stratified fivefold cross-validation was used to avoid sample bias in grouping. Feature extraction and model construction were performed as follows: first, inter-/intra-correlation coefficients and the least absolute shrinkage\u00a0and\u00a0selection operator algorithm were used to identify the most predictive feature subset. Subsequently, multiple discriminant models were constructed to explore and optimize the combination of six feature preprocessors (Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson, Max-Abs, Min-Max, Z-score, and Quantile) and three classifiers (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest). Selecting the one with the highest average value of the area under the curve (AUC) in the test set as the radiomics model, and the clinical screening model and combined model were also established using the same processing steps as the radiomics model. Finally, the performances of the three models were evaluated and analyzed using decision and correction curves.We observed that the logistic regression model based on the quantile preprocessor had the highest average AUC value in the discriminant models. Additionally, tumor location, the clinical of N stage, and hypertension were identified as independent clinical predictors of MSI status. In the test set, the clinical screening model demonstrated good predictive performance, with the average AUC of 0.762 (95% confidence interval, 0.635-0.890). Furthermore, the combined model showed excellent predictive\u00a0performance (AUC, 0.958; accuracy, 0.899; sensitivity, 0.929) and favorable clinical applicability and correction effects. The logistic regression model\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0the quantile preprocessor exhibited excellent performance and repeatability, which may further reduce the variability of input data and improve the model performance for predicting MSI status in CRC.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate and objective estimation of the postmortem interval (PMI) is crucial in forensic practice. This study aimed to infer PMI through equations based on the relationship between PMI and metabolomics biomarkers.Rats were subjected to models representing various temperatures and causes of death, with blood collected at different intervals. Untargeted gas chromatographymass spectrometry metabolomics detection methods were developed, and candidate biomarkers were chosen as co-differentially expressed metabolites in four models. A targeted method was then developed for quantitatively determining candidate biomarkers. Animal tests and human cadaver samples with clearly documented causes of death and time were used to verify the reliability of the regression equation.Results: Unique differential metabolites for CO poisoning deaths included 2,3-butanediol, hypoxanthine, and dehydrated hexanol, while those for mechanical asphyxia deaths comprised propylamine, 1,3-propylene glycol, phosphoric acid, and sorbitol. Pyruvate, glycerol and isoleucine were identified as candidate biomarkers. Human case results demonstrated the method's potential (error rate < 20\u202f%). The findings of this study may offer reference points for estimating PMI and causes of death in forensic practice.",

        "Abstract": "Manipulating orthogonally polarized waves independently in a single metasurface is pivotal. However, independently controlling the phase shifts of orthogonally polarized waves is difficult, especially in the same frequency bands. Here, we propose a receiver-phase shift-transmitter transmitarray with independent control of arbitrary polarization states in the same frequency bands, in which transmission rates reach more than 90% in the frequency bands 4.2~4.9 GHz and 5.3~5.5 GHz. By introducing a phase-regulation structure to each element, phases covering 360\u00b0 for different polarized incident waves can be independently controlled by different geometric parameters, and two-bit coding phases can be obtained. The design principle based on the two-port network's scattering matrix has been analyzed. To verify the independent tuning abilities of the proposed transmitarray for different polarization incidences in the same frequency bands, a multifunctional receive-phase shift-radiation coding transmitarray (RPRCT), which is composed of 16\u00d716 elements, with functions of anomalous refraction (for example, orbital angular momentum wave) and focusing transmission for different polarized incident waves was simulated and measured. The measured results agree reasonably well with the simulated ones. Our findings provide a simple method for obtaining a multifunctional metasurface with orthogonal polarization in the same frequency bands, which greatly improves the capacity and spectral efficiency of communication channels.",

        "Abstract": "Potential changes in patterns of dynamic functional network connections at the cerebellar-cerebral level in pontine infarction (PI) patients remain unclear. The study aimed to investigate the abnormal patterns of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) between the cerebellar subregions within networks and regions of the cerebral cortex in patients with PI. Forty-six chronic left pontine infarction (LPI), 32 chronic right pontine infarction (RPI), and 50 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited to undergo resting-state fMRI scans. Cerebellar-cerebral dFC was characterized using the sliding window method and seed-based connectivity analyses. Correlations between altered dFC values and clinical variables (The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test and Flanker task) in PI patients and healthy controls were investigated. Compared with HCs, the PI groups showed significantly aberrant cerebellar-cerebral dFC between cerebellar subregions within networks and supratentorial cerebral cortex, including executive, default-mode, and motor networks. Furthermore, Correlation analysis showed a decoupling between abnormal dFC and cognitive functions in PI patients. These findings indicate that PI patients are accompanied by damage to cerebellar subregions within networks and cerebellar-cerebral pathways, which may provide a potential target for treatment or an indication of therapeutic efficacy.",

        "Abstract": "Botanical pesticides are one of the most promising alternatives to synthetic insecticides for green pest management. However, their efficacies must be further improved to meet real needs. Here we designed a nanoscale camptothecin (CPT) encapsulated in a star polycation (SPc) and determined its bioactivity against a devastating agricultural pest, Spodoptera frugiperda. The self-assembly of CPT/SPc complex was mainly driven by hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals forces to decrease the particle size from 789 to 298\u202fnm. With the help of SPc, the contact angle of CPT decreased from 116\u00b0 to 92\u00b0 on maize leaves, and its retention was increased from 5.53 to 11.97\u202fmg/cm",

        "Abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is the main component of plant Cannabis (Cannabis sativa), which exhibits strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. With the legalization of CBD in the United States, it is an inevitable tendency for its global legalization in the future. Therefore, it has become an urgent task to conduct the toxicological evaluation of CBD before clinical application. In this study, the developmental toxicities of CBD on zebrafish embryos were systematically evaluated, and the mechanisms were revealed. The results showed that the phenotype of liver degeneration was observed in 96 hpf zebrafish embryos after 0.1-5\u00a0\u03bcmol/L CBD exposure, further RT-qPCR experiments indicated that the above result may attributed by the alterations of FABP10A, GCLC, and GSR. Besides, 1 and 5\u00a0\u03bcmol/L CBD contributed to the developmental toxicities of heart and eye in zebrafish embryos, characterizing by the decrease in heart rate, the phenotype of pericardial edema, and the reduce of eye area. Compared to other organs, the liver of zebrafish displayed the most sensitive characteristic to CBD exposure, as 0.1\u00a0\u03bcmol/L CBD already led to the phenotype of liver degeneration. In summary, this paper provided theoretical supports for CBD toxicology research, and laid the foundation for its future clinical application.",

        "Title": "Cell volume regulation modulates macrophage-related inflammatory responses via JAK/STAT signaling pathways.",
        "Abstract": "Cell volume as a characteristic of changes in response to external environmental cues has been shown to control the fate of stem cells. However, its influence on macrophage behavior and macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses have rarely been explored. Herein, through mediating the volume of macrophages by adding polyethylene glycol (PEG), we demonstrated the feasibility of fine-tuning cell volume to regulate macrophage polarization towards anti-inflammatory phenotypes, thereby enabling to reverse macrophage-mediated inflammation response. Specifically, lower the volume of primary macrophages can induce both resting macrophages (M0) and stimulated pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) to up-regulate the expression of anti-inflammatory factors and down-regulate pro-inflammatory factors. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that macrophage polarization resulting from changing cell volume might be mediated by JAK/STAT signaling pathway evidenced by the transcription sequencing analysis. We further propose to apply this strategy for the treatment of arthritis via direct introduction of PEG into the joint cavity to modulate synovial macrophage-related inflammation. Our preliminary results verified the credibility and effectiveness of this treatment evidenced by the significant inhibition of cartilage destruction and synovitis at early stage. In general, our results suggest that cell volume can be a biophysical regulatory factor to control macrophage polarization and potentially medicate inflammatory response, thereby providing a potential facile and effective therapy for modulating macrophage mediated inflammatory responses. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Cell volume has recently been recognized as a significantly important biophysical signal in regulating cellular functionalities and even steering cell fate. Herein, through mediating the volume of macrophages by adding polyethylene glycol (PEG), we demonstrated the feasibility of fine-tuning cell volume to induce M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages to polarize towards anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, and this immunomodulatory effect may be mediated by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. We also proposed the feasible applications of this PEG-induced volume regulation approach towards the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), wherein our preliminary results implied an effective alleviation of early synovitis. Our study on macrophage polarization mediated by cell volume may open up new pathways for immune regulation through microenvironmental biophysical clues.",

        "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for biomarkers important for clinical phenotypes can lead to clinically relevant discoveries. Conventional GWAS for quantitative traits are based on simplified regression models modeling the conditional mean of a phenotype as a linear function of genotype. We draw attention here to an alternative, lesser known approach, namely quantile regression that naturally extends linear regression to the analysis of the entire conditional distribution of a phenotype of interest. Quantile regression can be applied efficiently at biobank scale, while having some unique advantages such as (1) identifying variants with heterogeneous effects across quantiles of the phenotype distribution; (2) accommodating a wide range of phenotype distributions including non-normal distributions, with invariance of results to trait transformations; and (3) providing more detailed information about genotype-phenotype associations even for those associations identified by conventional GWAS. We show in simulations that quantile regression is powerful across both homogeneous and various heterogeneous models. Applications to 39 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank demonstrate that quantile regression can be a helpful complement to linear regression in GWAS and can identify variants with larger effects on high-risk subgroups of individuals but with lower or no contribution overall.",

        "Abstract": "Numerous tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, identified as E3 ubiquitin ligases, participate in various viral infections through ubiquitylation, ISGylation, and SUMOylation processes. Respiratory viruses, particularly influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory coronaviruses (CoVs), have severely threatened public health with high morbidity and mortality, causing incalculable losses. Research on the regulation of TRIM proteins in respiratory virus infections is crucial for disease prevention and control. This review introduces TRIM proteins, summarizes recent discoveries regarding their roles and molecular mechanisms in IAV and CoVs infections, discusses current research gaps, and explores potential future trends in this rapidly developing field. It aims to enhance understanding of virus-host interactions and inform the development of new molecularly targeted therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Acoustic emission (AE) technology has been widely utilized to monitor the SiC wafer lapping process. The root-mean-square (RMS) of the time-domain eigenvalues of the AE signal has a linear relationship with the material removal rate (MRR). However, the existence of background noise severely reduces signal monitoring accuracy. Noise interference often leads to increased RMS deviation and signal distortion. In the study presented in this manuscript, a frequency threshold noise reduction approach was developed by combining and improving wavelet packet noise reduction and spectral subtraction noise reduction techniques. Three groups of SiC lapping experiments were conducted on a fixed abrasive pad, and the lapping acoustic signals were processed using three different noise reduction approaches: frequency threshold, wavelet packet, and spectral subtraction. The results show that the noise reduction method using the frequency threshold is the most effective, with the best coefficient of determination (R",

        "Abstract": "The utilization of acid as a synthesis assistant provides an effective means to regulate the structure of hydrogels, thereby simplifying the design and preparation process of multifunctional hydrogels. However, there remains a dearth of discourse concerning the utilization of this convenient acid-mediated strategy, which possesses the potential to directly govern molecular interactions within gel networks for rational structure and property design. Herein, we describe the preparation of flexible dual-network conductive hydrogels using polyacrylamide (PAM) and sodium alginate (SA) as substrates, driven by the strategy of acid-mediated (HCI, H",

        "Abstract": "Reciprocal interactions between alveolar fibroblasts and epithelial cells are crucial for lung homeostasis, injury repair, and fibrogenesis, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate, we administered the fibroblast-selective TGF\u03b21 signaling inhibitor, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), to Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) patients undergoing diagnostic lung biopsy and conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on spare tissue. Biopsies from untreated patients showed higher fibroblast TGF\u03b21 signaling compared to non-disease donor or end-stage ILD tissues. In vivo, EGCG downregulated TGF\u03b21 signaling and several pro-inflammatory and stress pathways in biopsy samples. Notably, EGCG reduced fibroblast secreted frizzle-like receptor protein 2 (sFRP2), an unrecognized TGF\u03b21 fibroblast target gene induced near type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) in situ. Using AEC2-fibroblast coculture organoids and precision cut lung slices (PCLS) from non-diseased donors, we found TGF\u03b21 signaling promotes a spread AEC2 KRT17+ basaloid state, whereupon sFRP2 then activates a mature Krt5+ basal cell program. Wnt-receptor Frizzled 5 (Fzd5) expression and downstream calcineurin signaling were required for sFRP2-induced nuclear NFATc3 accumulation and KRT5 expression. These findings highlight stage-specific TGF\u03b21 signaling in ILD, the therapeutic potential of EGCG in reducing IPF-related transcriptional changes, and identify TGF\u03b21-non-canonical Wnt pathway crosstalk via sFRP2 as a novel mechanism for dysfunctional epithelial signaling in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis/ILD.",

        "Abstract": "Given the high prevalence of avian leukosis virus subgroup K (ALV-K) in chickens in China, the positive rate of ALV-K in local chickens in Henan province was investigated, and the genetic region encoding the glycoprotein gp85 of isolates from positive chickens was analyzed. The positive rate of ALV-K in local chickens in Henan was found to be 87.2% (41/47). Phylogenetic analysis of gp85 sequences revealed six clusters that differed in their host range regions (hr1 and hr2) and variable regions (vr1, vr2, and vr3). Evidence of recombination of hr1, hr2, vr1, vr2, and vr3 was observed between the different clusters. The isolate HN23LS02 appears to have obtained its hr1 and hr2 regions from separate lineages via recombination but without having a significant affect on the replication capacity of the virus.",

        "Abstract": "Environmental mapping and robot navigation are the basis for realizing robot automation in modern agricultural production. This study proposes a new autonomous mapping and navigation method for gardening scene robots. First, a new LiDAR slam-based semantic mapping algorithm is proposed to enable the robots to analyze structural information from point cloud images and generate roadmaps from them. Secondly, a general robot navigation framework is proposed to enable the robot to generate the shortest global path according to the road map, and consider the local terrain information to find the optimal local path to achieve safe and efficient trajectory tracking; this method is equipped in apple orchards. The LiDAR was evaluated on a differential drive robotic platform. Experimental results show that this method can effectively process orchard environmental information. Compared with vnf and pointnet++, the semantic information extraction efficiency and time are greatly improved. The map feature extraction time can be reduced to 0.1681 s, and its MIoU is 0.812. The resulting global path planning achieved a 100% success rate, with an average run time of 4ms. At the same time, the local path planning algorithm can effectively generate safe and smooth trajectories to execute the global path, with an average running time of 36 ms.",

        "Title": "Treatment of colorectal cancer by traditional Chinese medicine: prevention and treatment mechanisms.",
        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant global health burden, with high morbidity and mortality rates. It is often diagnosed at middle to advanced stage, affecting approximately 35% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Currently, chemotherapy has been used to improve patient prognosis and increase overall survival. However, chemotherapy can also have cytotoxic effects and lead to adverse reactions, such as inhibiting bone marrow hematopoiesis, causing digestive dysfunction, hand-foot syndrome, and even life-threatening conditions. In response to these adverse effects, researchers have proposed using Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as an option to treat cancer. TCM research focuses on prescriptions, herbs, and components, which form essential components of the current research in Chinese medicine. The study and implementation of TCM prescriptions and herbs demonstrate its distinctive holistic approach to therapy, characterized by applying multi-component and multi-target treatment. TMC components have advantages in developing new drugs as they consist of single ingredients, require smaller medication dosages, have a precise measure of pharmacodynamic effects, and have a clear mechanism of action compared to TCM prescriptions and herbs. However, further research is still needed to determine whether TMC components can fully substitute the therapeutic efficacy of TCM prescriptions. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the research advancements made in TCM prescriptions, herbs, and components. The findings of this study can serve as a theoretical basis for researchers who are interested in exploring the potential of TCM for the treatment of colorectal cancer.",

        "Abstract": "An experimental validation of a robotic system for radioactive iodine-125 seed implantation (RISI) in tumor treatment was conducted using customized phantom models and animal models simulating liver and lung lesions. The robotic system, consisting of planning, navigation, and implantation modules, was employed to implant dummy radioactive seeds into the models. Fiducial markers were used for target localization. In phantom experiments across 40 cases, the mean errors between planned and actual seed positions were 0.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.05\u00a0mm, 1.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.62\u00a0mm, and 0.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.05\u00a0mm in the x, y, and z directions, respectively. The x, y, and z directions correspond to the left-right, anterior-posterior, and superior-inferior anatomical planes. Silicone phantoms exhibiting significantly smaller x-axis errors compared to liver and lung phantoms (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Template assistance significantly reduced errors in all axes (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). No significant dosimetric deviations were observed in parameters such as D90, V100, and V150 between plans and post-implant doses (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). In animal experiments across 23 liver and lung cases, the mean implantation errors were 1.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77\u00a0mm, 1.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.69\u00a0mm, and 1.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.93\u00a0mm in the x, y, and z directions, slightly higher than in phantoms (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), with no significant differences between liver and lung models. The dosimetric results closely matched planned values, confirming the accuracy of the robotic system for RISI, offering new possibilities in clinical tumor treatment.",

Macrophages, particularly the alternatively activated macrophages (M2 subtype), have been acknowledged for their substantial involvement in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Hence, targeting macrophages emerges as a plausible therapeutic avenue for IPF. Icariside II (ISE II) is a natural flavonoid glycoside molecule known for its excellent anti-tumor and anti-fibrotic activities. Nevertheless, the impact of ISE II on pulmonary fibrosis and the intricate mechanisms through which it operates have yet to be elucidated.",

        "Abstract": "This study investigates abnormalities in cerebellar-cerebral static and dynamic functional connectivity among patients with acute pontine infarction, examining the relationship between these connectivity changes and behavioral dysfunction. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was utilized to collect data from 45 patients within seven days post-pontine infarction and 34 normal controls. Seed-based static and dynamic functional connectivity analyses identified divergences in cerebellar-cerebral connectivity features between pontine infarction patients and normal controls. Correlations between abnormal functional connectivity features and behavioral scores were explored. Compared to normal controls, left pontine infarction patients exhibited significantly increased static functional connectivity within the executive, affective-limbic, and motor networks. Conversely, right pontine infarction patients demonstrated decreased static functional connectivity in the executive, affective-limbic, and default mode networks, alongside an increase in the executive and motor networks. Decreased temporal variability of dynamic functional connectivity was observed in the executive and default mode networks among left pontine infarction patients. Furthermore, abnormalities in static and dynamic functional connectivity within the executive network correlated with motor and working memory performance in patients. These findings suggest that alterations in cerebellar-cerebral static and dynamic functional connectivity could underpin the behavioral dysfunctions observed in acute pontine infarction patients.",

        "Title": "Adipose tissue macrophages secrete small extracellular vesicles that mediate rosiglitazone-induced insulin sensitization.",
        "Abstract": "The obesity epidemic continues to worsen worldwide, driving metabolic and chronic inflammatory diseases. Thiazolidinediones, such as rosiglitazone (Rosi), are PPAR\u03b3 agonists that promote 'M2-like' adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) polarization and cause insulin sensitization. As ATM-derived small extracellular vesicles (ATM-sEVs) from lean mice are known to increase insulin sensitivity, we assessed the metabolic effects of ATM-sEVs from Rosi-treated obese male mice (Rosi-ATM-sEVs). Here we show that Rosi leads to improved glucose and insulin tolerance, transcriptional repolarization of ATMs and increased sEV secretion. Administration of Rosi-ATM-sEVs rescues obesity-induced glucose intolerance and insulin sensitivity in vivo without the known thiazolidinedione-induced adverse effects of weight gain or haemodilution. Rosi-ATM-sEVs directly increase insulin sensitivity in adipocytes, myotubes and primary mouse and human hepatocytes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the miRNAs within Rosi-ATM-sEVs, primarily miR-690, are responsible for these beneficial metabolic effects. Thus, using ATM-sEVs with specific miRNAs may provide a therapeutic path to induce insulin sensitization.",

        "Title": "Global distribution, cross-species transmission, and receptor binding of canine parvovirus-2: Risks and implications for humans.",
        "Abstract": "For canine parvovirus -2 (CPV-2), a zoonotic virus capable of cross-species transmission in animals, the amino acid changes of capsid protein VP2 are key factors when binding to other species' transferrin receptors (TfR). CPV-2 variants can spread from felines and canines, for example, to Carnivora, Artiodactyla, and Pholidota species, and CPV-2c variants are essential to spread from Carnivora to Artiodactyla and Pholidota species in particular. In our study, a CPV-2a variant maintained a relatively stable trend, and the proportion of CPV-2c gradually rose from 1980 to 2021. The VP2 amino acid sequence analysis showed that five amino acid mutations at 426E/D, 305H/D, and 297S may be necessary for the virus to bind to different host receptors. Meanwhile, receptor-binding loop regions and amino acid sites 87\u202fL, 93\u202fN, 232I, and 305Y were associated with CPV-2 cross-species transmission. The homology of TfRs in different hosts infected with CPV-2 ranged from 77.2\u202f% to 99.0\u202f%, and from pig to feline, canine, and humans was 80.7\u202f%, 80.4\u202f%, and 77.2\u202f%, respectively. The amino acid residues of TfRs involved in the viral binding in those hosts are highly conserved, which suggests that CPV-2 may be capable of pig-to-human transmission. Our analysis of the origin, evolutionary trend, cross-species transmission dynamics, and genetic characteristics of CPV-2 when binding to host receptors provides a theoretical basis for further research on CPV-2's mechanism of cross-species transmission and for establishing an early warning and monitoring mechanism for the possible threat of CPV-2 to animal-human public security.",

        "Abstract": "Background Microwave ablation (MWA) is currently under preliminary investigation for the treatment of multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and has shown promising treatment efficacy. Compared with surgical resection (SR), MWA is minimally invasive and could preserve thyroid function. However, a comparative analysis between MWA and SR is warranted to draw definitive conclusions. Purpose To compare MWA and SR for preoperative US-detected T1N0M0 multifocal PTC in terms of overall and 1-, 3-, and 5-year progression-free survival rates and complication rates. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 775 patients with preoperative US-detected T1N0M0 multifocal PTC treated with MWA or SR across 10 centers between May 2015 and December 2021 were included. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed for patients in the MWA and SR groups, followed by comparisons between the two groups. The primary outcomes were overall and 1-, 3-, and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates and complication rates. Results After PSM, 229 patients (median age, 44 years [IQR 36.5-50.5 years]; 179 female) in the MWA group and 453 patients (median age, 45 years [IQR 37-53 years]; 367 female) in the SR group were observed for a median of 20 months (range, 12-74 months) and 26 months (range, 12-64 months), respectively. MWA resulted in less blood loss, shorter incision length, and shorter procedure and hospitalization durations (all ",

Brassinosteroids are synthesized in the cell interior but bind receptors at the cell surface, necessitating a yet to be identified export mechanism. Here, we show that a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, ABCB19, functions as a brassinosteroid exporter. We present its structure in both the substrate-unbound and the brassinosteroid-bound states. Bioactive brassinosteroids are potent activators of ABCB19 ATP hydrolysis activity, and transport assays showed that ABCB19 transports brassinosteroids. In ",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, the ongoing electrical vehicles and energy storage devices give a great demand of high-energy-density lithium battery. The commercial graphite anode has been reached the limit of the theoretical capacity. Herein, we introduce lithium metal anode to demonstrate the promising anode which can replace graphite. Lithium metal has a high theoretical capacity and the lowest electrochemical potential. Hence, using lithium metal as the anode material of lithium batteries can reach the limit of energy and power density of lithium batteries. However, lithium metal has huge flaw such as unstable SEI layer, volume change and dendrites formation. Therefore, we give a review of the lithium metal anode on its issues and introduce the existing research to overcome these. Besides, we give the perspective that the engineering problems also restrict the commercial use of lithium metal. This review provides the reasonable method to enhance the lithium metal performance and give the development direction for the subsequent research.",

        "Abstract": "The escalating problem of compound arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) contamination in agricultural soils necessitates the urgency for effective remediation strategies. This is compounded by the opposing geochemical behaviors of As and Cd in soil, and the efficacy of biochar treatment remains unclear. This pioneering study integrated 3780 observation pairs referred from 92 peer-reviewed articles to investigate the impact of iron-modified biochar on As and Cd responses across diverse soil environments. Regarding the treatments, 1) biochar significantly decreased the exchangeable and acid-soluble fraction of As (AsF1, 20.9%) and Cd (CdF1, 24.0%) in paddy fields; 2) iron-modified biochar significantly decreased AsF1 (32.0%) and CdF1 (27.4%); 3) iron-modified biochar in paddy fields contributed to the morphological changes in As and Cd, mainly characterized by a decrease in AsF1 (36.5%) and CdF1 (36.3%) and an increase in the reducible fraction of As (19.7%) and Cd (39.2%); and 4) iron-modified biochar in paddy fields increased As (43.1%) and Cd (53.7%) concentrations in the iron plaque on root surfaces. We conclude that iron-modified biochar treatment of paddy fields is promising in remediating As and Cd contamination by promoting the formation of iron plaque.",

Biodegradation pathways are currently considered the most efficient solution to remove ZEN contamination from foods. However, low degradation rates and vulnerability to environmental impacts limit the application of biodegradation pathways. Therefore, the main research objective of this article was to screen strains that can efficiently degrade ZEN and survive under harsh conditions. This study successfully isolated a new strain L9 which can efficiently degrade ZEN from 108 food ingredients. The results of sequence alignment showed that L9 is ",

        "Abstract": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that carry lipids, proteins, and microRNAs (miRNAs). They are released by all cell types and can be found not only in circulation but in many biological fluids. Exosomes are essential for interorgan communication because they can transfer their contents from donor to recipient cells, modulating cellular functions. The miRNA content of exosomes is responsible for most of their biological effects, and changes in exosomal miRNA levels can contribute to the progression or regression of metabolic diseases. As exosomal miRNAs are selectively sorted and packaged into exosomes, they can be useful as biomarkers for diagnosing diseases. The field of exosomes and metabolism is expanding rapidly, and researchers are consistently making new discoveries in this area. As a result, exosomes have great potential for a next-generation drug delivery platform for metabolic diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola secretes effectors into rice tissues to modulate host immunity. Here, we characterised MgCRT1, a calreticulin protein of M. graminicola, and identified its target in the plant. In situ hybridisation showed MgCRT1 mRNA accumulating in the subventral oesophageal gland in J2 nematodes. Immunolocalization indicated MgCRT1 localises in the giant cells during parasitism. Host-induced gene silencing of MgCRT1 reduced the infection ability of M. graminicola, while over-expressing MgCRT1 enhanced rice susceptibility to M. graminicola. A yeast two-hybrid approach identified the calmodulin-like protein OsCML31 as an interactor of MgCRT1. OsCML31 interacts with the high mobility group protein OsHMGB1 which is a conserved DNA binding protein. Knockout of OsCML31 or overexpression of OsHMGB1 in rice results in enhanced susceptibility to M. graminicola. In contrast, overexpression of OsCML31 or knockout of OsHMGB1 in rice decreases susceptibility to M. graminicola. The GST-pulldown and luciferase complementation imaging assay showed that MgCRT1 decreases the interaction of OsCML31 and OsHMGB1 in a competitive manner. In conclusion, when M. graminicola infects rice and secretes MgCRT1 into rice, MgCRT1 interacts with OsCML31 and decreases the association of OsCML31 with OsHMGB1, resulting in the release of OsHMGB1 to enhance rice susceptibility.",

        "Title": "Proteomic Characteristics of the Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus in Mice with Chronic Ketamine-Induced Anxiety and Cognitive Impairment.",
        "Abstract": "Schizophrenia, a complex psychiatric disorder with diverse symptoms, has been linked to ketamine, known for its N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonistic properties. Understanding the distinct roles and mechanisms of ketamine is crucial, especially regarding its induction of schizophrenia-like symptoms. Recent research highlights the impact of ketamine on key brain regions associated with schizophrenia, specifically the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (Hip). This study focused on these regions to explore proteomic changes related to anxiety and cognitive impairment in a chronic ketamine-induced mouse model of schizophrenia. After twelve consecutive days of ketamine administration, brain tissues from these regions were dissected and analyzed. Using tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling quantitative proteomics techniques, 34,797 and 46,740 peptides were identified in PFC and Hip, corresponding to 5,668 and 6,463 proteins, respectively. In the PFC, a total of 113 proteins showed differential expression, primarily associated with the immuno-inflammatory process, calmodulin, postsynaptic density protein, and mitochondrial function. In the Hip, 129 differentially expressed proteins were screened, mainly related to synaptic plasticity proteins and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex-associated proteins. Additionally, we investigated key proteins within the glutamatergic synapse pathway and observed decreased expression levels of phosphorylated CaMKII and CREB. Overall, the study unveiled a significant proteomic signature in the chronic ketamine-induced schizophrenia mouse model, characterized by anxiety and cognitive impairment in both the PFC and Hip, and this comprehensive proteomic dataset may not only enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine-related mental disorders but also offer valuable insights for future disease treatments.",

        "Abstract": "The difficulty of wound healing due to skin defects has been a great challenge due to the complex inflammatory microenvironment. Delayed wound healing severely affects the quality of life of patients and represents a significant economic burden for public health systems worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of novel wound dressings that can efficiently resist drug-resistant bacteria and have superior wound repair capabilities in clinical applications. In this study, we designed an adhesive antimicrobial hydrogel dressing (GMH) based on methacrylic-anhydride-modified gelatin and oxidized hyaluronic acid formed by Schiff base and UV-induced double cross-linking for infected wound repair. By inserting PDA nanoparticles into the hydrogel (GMH/PDA), the hydrogel has the capability of photothermal conversion and exhibits good photothermal antimicrobial properties under near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation, which helps to reduce the inflammatory response and avoid bacterial infections during the wound healing process. In addition, GMH/PDA hydrogel exhibits excellent injectability, allowing the hydrogel dressings to be adapted to complex wound surfaces, making them promising candidates for wound therapy. In conclusion, the multifunctional injectable GMH/PDA hydrogel possesses high antimicrobial efficiency, antioxidant properties and good biocompatibility, making them promising candidates for the treatment of infected skin wounds.",

Nanotechnology is expected to enhance the effectiveness of conventional biostimulants. Herein, the current study constructed an efficient proline (Pro) nanodelivery system based on a star polyamine (SPc). The hydroxyl groups of Pro could assemble with carbonyl groups of SPc, and the self-assembly of Pro with SPc formed the nanoscale particles of the Pro/SPc complex. Compared to Pro alone, the contact angle of SPc-loaded Pro decreased, and its retentivity and plant uptake increased. Importantly, the tobacco (",

        "Abstract": "BCL-2 family members are known to be implicated in survival in numerous biological settings. Here, we provide evidence that in injury and repair processes in lungs, BCL-2 mainly acts to attenuate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and limit extracellular matrix accumulation. Days after an intratracheal bleomycin challenge, mice lose a fraction of their alveolar type II epithelium from terminal ER stress driven by activation of the critical ER sensor and stress effector IRE1\u03b1. This fraction is dramatically increased by BCL-2 inhibition, because IRE1\u03b1 activation is dependent on its physical association with the BCL-2-proapoptotic family member BAX, and we found BCL-2 to disrupt this association ",

        "Abstract": "East and Southern Africa have the highest HIV incidence and prevalence in the world, with adolescents and young adults being at the greatest risk. Despite effective combination prevention tools, including the recently available pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), HIV incidence among adolescents and young adults in Uganda remains high, and PrEP use remains low. Mental health and substance use (behavioral health) play a role in sexual behavior and decision-making, contributing to an increase in the risk for acquiring HIV. Interventions that target multiple HIV risk factors, including sexual and mental health and problematic substance use, are crucial to ending the HIV epidemic. Yet few interventions addressing HIV related health disparities and comorbidities among adolescents and young adults in East and Southern Africa currently exist.",

        "Abstract": "Sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus displays the typical circadian rhythms. This present study investigated the molecular regulation of clock genes, as well as monoamines and melatonin, in multiple tissues of A. japonicus, responding to the photoperiod. In order to determine their pivotal role in circadian rhythms, the crucial clock genes, namely AjClock, AjArnt1, AjCry1, and AjTimeless, were identified and a comprehensive analysis of their expressions across various tissues in adult A. japonicus was conducted, revealing the potential existence of central and peripheral oscillators. Results demonstrated that the tissues of polian vesicle and nerve ring exhibited significant clock gene expression associated with the orchestration of circadian regulation, and that environmental light fluctuations exerted influence on the expression of these clock genes. However, a number of genes, such as AjArnt1 and AjCry1, maintained their circadian rhythmicity even under continuous light conditions. Moreover, we further investigated the circadian patterns of melatonin (MT), serotonin (5-HT), and dopamine (DA) secretion in A. japonicus, data that underscored the tissue-specific regulatory differences and the inherent adaptability to dynamic light environments. Collectively, these findings will provide the molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm in echinoderms and the candidate tissues playing the role of central oscillators in sea cucumbers.",

        "Title": "Pyroptosis in glioma: Current management and future application.",
        "Abstract": "Glioma, the predominant form of central nervous system (CNS) malignancies, presents a significant challenge due to its high prevalence and low 5-year survival rate. The efficacy of current treatment methods is limited by the presence of the blood-brain barrier, the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and other factors. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach, as it can overcome the blood-brain barrier. A tumor's immune privilege, which is induced by an immunosuppressive environment, constricts immunotherapy's clinical impact in glioma. Pyroptosis, a programmed cell death mechanism facilitated by gasdermins, plays a significant role in the management of glioma. Its ability to initiate and regulate tumor occurrence, progression, and metastasis is well-established. However, it is crucial to note that uncontrolled or excessive cell death can result in tissue damage, acute inflammation, and cytokine release syndrome, thereby potentially promoting tumor advancement or recurrence. This paper aims to elucidate the molecular pathways involved in pyroptosis and subsequently discuss its induction in cancer therapy. In addition, the current treatment methods of glioma and the use of pyroptosis in these treatments are introduced. It is hoped to provide more ideas for the treatment of glioma.",

However, the safety and selective toxicity of nanocarrier-loaded pesticides should be clarified toward natural predators. In this context, an efficient spirotetramat nanodelivery system was successfully constructed based on a star polymer (SPc). Spirotetramat could complex with SPc through hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces spontaneously. The self-assembly of the spirotetramat/SPc complex decreased the particle size of spirotetramat from 1292 to 710 nm. After the complexation with SPc, the lethal concentration 50 (LC",

        "Abstract": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI), as an important problem in computer vision, requires locating the human-object pair and identifying the interactive relationships between them. The HOI instance has a greater span in spatial, scale, and task than the individual object instance, making its detection more susceptible to noisy backgrounds. To alleviate the disturbance of noisy backgrounds on HOI detection, it is necessary to consider the input image information to generate fine-grained anchors which are then leveraged to guide the detection of HOI instances. However, it has the following challenges. i) how to extract pivotal features from the images with complex background information is still an open question. ii) how to semantically align the extracted features and query embeddings is also a difficult issue. In this paper, a novel end-to-end transformer-based framework (FGAHOI) is proposed to alleviate the above problems. FGAHOI comprises three dedicated components namely, multi-scale sampling (MSS), hierarchical spatial-aware merging (HSAM) and task-aware merging mechanism (TAM). MSS extracts features of humans, objects and interaction areas from noisy backgrounds for HOI instances of various scales. HSAM and TAM semantically align and merge the extracted features and query embeddings in the hierarchical spatial and task perspectives in turn. In the meanwhile, a novel training strategy Stage-wise Training Strategy is designed to reduce the training pressure caused by overly complex tasks done by FGAHOI. In addition, we propose two ways to measure the difficulty of HOI detection and a novel dataset, i.e., HOI-SDC for the two challenges (Uneven Distributed Area in Human-Object Pairs and Long Distance Visual Modeling of Human-Object Pairs) of HOI instances detection. Experiments are conducted on three benchmarks: HICO-DET, HOI-SDC and V-COCO. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art HOI detection methods, and the extensive ablations reveal the merits of our proposed contribution.",

        "Abstract": "To meet the increasing needs of point-of-care testing in clinical diagnosis and daily health monitoring, numerous cutting-edge techniques have emerged to upgrade current portable biosensors with higher sensitivity, smaller size, and better intelligence. In particular, due to the controlled locomotion characteristics in the micro/nano scale, microrobots can effectively enhance the sensitivity of biosensors by disrupting conventional passive diffusion into an active enrichment during the test. In addition, microrobots are ideal to create biosensors with functions of on-demand delivery, transportation, and multi-objective detections with the capability of actively controlled motion. In this review, five types of portable biosensors and their integration with microrobots are critically introduced. Microrobots can enhance the detection signal in fluorescence intensity and surface-enhanced Raman scattering detection via the active enrichment. The existence and quantity of detection substances also affect the motion state of microrobots for the locomotion-based detection. In addition, microrobots realize the indirect detection of the bio-molecules by functionalizing their surfaces in the electrochemical current and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy detections. We pay a special focus on the roles of microrobots with active locomotion to enhance the detection performance of portable sensors. At last, perspectives and future trends of microrobots in biosensing are also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R) injury is a clinical conundrum during the treatment of ischemic stroke. Cell-derived exosomes (CDE) were proved to be therapeutically effective for CI/R injury. However, production of CDE is time and effort consuming. Increasing studies reported that plants can also generate exosome-like nanoparticles (ELN) which are therapeutically effective and have higher yield compared with CDE. In this study, a commonly used Chinese herb Panax notoginseng (PN), whose active ingredients were well-documented in the treatment of CI/R injury, was chosen as a source of ELNs. It was found that Panax notoginseng derived exosome like nanoparticles (PDN) could enter the brain without modification and ameliorate cerebral infarct volume, improve behavior outcome and maintained the integrity of BBB. PDNs attenuated CI/R injury by altering the phenotype of microglia from \"pro-inflammation\" M1 type to \"anti-inflammation\" M2 type. Also, we found that lipids from PDNs were the major therapeutic effective component. As a mechanism of action, PDN was proved to exert therapeutic effect via activating pI3k/Akt pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Short peptides have gained widespread utilization as functional constituents in the development of functional foods due to their remarkable biological activity. Previous investigations have established the positive influence of oysters on testosterone biosynthesis, although the underlying mechanism remains elusive. This study aims to assess the impact of three dipeptides derived from oysters on the oxidative stress state of TM3 cells induced by AAPH while concurrently examining alterations in cellular testosterone biosynthesis capacity. The investigation encompasses an analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, antioxidant enzyme activity, apoptotic status, and expression levels of crucial enzymes involved in the testosterone synthesis pathway within TM3 cells, thus evaluating the physiological activity of the three dipeptides. Additionally, molecular docking was employed to investigate the inhibitory activity of the three dipeptides against ACE. The outcomes of this study imply that the oxidative stress state of cells impedes the synthesis of testosterone by inhibiting the expression of essential proteins in the testosterone synthesis pathway. These three dipeptides derived from oysters ameliorate cellular oxidative stress by directly scavenging excess ROS or reducing ROS production rather than enhancing cellular antioxidant capacity through modulation of antioxidant enzyme activity. These findings introduce a novel avenue for developing and utilizing antioxidant peptides derived from food sources.",

        "Abstract": "The sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus is an economically important marine species in China, and understanding the mechanisms underlying its gonad development is crucial for successful reproduction and breeding. In this study, we performed transcriptome comparisons and analyses of A. japonicus gonadal and non-gonadal tissues to identify genes and molecular pathways associated with gonadal development. We also supplemented the annotation of the A. japonicus genome. Collectively, results revealed a total of 941 ovary-specific genes and 2499 testis-specific genes through different expression analysis and WGCNA analysis. The most enriched pathways in ovary and testis were \"DNA replication\" and \"purine metabolism\", respectively. Additionally, we identified key candidate gene modules that control gonad development and germ cell maturation, with CDT1 and DYNC2LI1 serving as hub genes. Our findings provide important insights into the gonadal development system of A. japonicus and offer valuable references for further research on reproductive biology in this marine invertebrate species.",

        "Abstract": "High-performance zeolite-supported noble metal catalysts with low loading and high dispersion of active components are the most promising materials for achieving the complete oxidation of formaldehyde (HCHO) at room temperature. In this work, palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) with different sizes were successfully encapsulated inside the silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite framework by using diverse stabling ligands via the one-pot method. Thereafter, the rule on selecting the coordinative ligands for palladium was clarified: more N atoms, a short carbon chain, a smaller branch chain, and bidentate coordination are characteristics of an ideal ligand. Accordingly, the best-performing 0.2Pd@S-1(Ethylenediamine) catalyst exhibited outstanding performance for HCHO oxidation, achieving 100% conversion even at room temperature. High-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR HAADF-STEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the chelate is formed by complexation of Pd",

        "Title": "Mild sleep restriction increases endothelial oxidative stress in female persons.",
        "Abstract": "Sleep restriction is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, which is more pronounced in female than male persons. We reported recently first causal evidence that mild, prolonged sleep restriction mimicking \"real-life\" conditions impairs endothelial function, a key step in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, in healthy female persons. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In model organisms, sleep restriction increases oxidative stress and upregulates antioxidant response via induction of the antioxidant regulator nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). Here, we assessed directly endothelial cell oxidative stress and antioxidant responses in healthy female persons (n\u2009=\u200935) after 6\u00a0weeks of mild sleep restriction (1.5\u00a0h less than habitual sleep) using randomized crossover design. Sleep restriction markedly increased endothelial oxidative stress without upregulating antioxidant response. Using RNA-seq and a predicted protein-protein interaction database, we identified reduced expression of endothelial Defective in Cullin Neddylation-1 Domain Containing 3 (DCUN1D3), a protein that licenses Nrf2 antioxidant responses, as a mediator of impaired endothelial antioxidant response in sleep restriction. Thus, sleep restriction impairs clearance of endothelial oxidative stress that over time increases cardiovascular risk.Trial Registration: NCT02835261\u2003.",

        "Abstract": "Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone essential to the regulation of numerous aspects of plant growth and development. The cellular level of ABA is critical to its signalling and is determined by its rate of biosynthesis, catabolism and the rates of ABA transport. ABCG25 in Arabidopsis thaliana has been identified to be an ABA exporter and play roles in regulating stomatal closure and seed germination. However, its ABA transport mechanism remains unknown. Here we report the structures of ABCG25 under different states using cryo-electron microscopy single particle analysis: the apo state and ABA-bound state of the wild-type ABCG25 and the ATP-bound state of the ATPase catalytic mutant. ABCG25 forms a homodimer. ABA binds to a cone-shaped, cytosolic-facing cavity formed in the middle of the transmembrane domains. Key residues in ABA binding are identified and verified by a cell-based ABA transport assay. ATP binding leads to closing of the nucleotide-binding domains of opposing monomers and conformational transitions of the transmembrane domains. Together, these results provide insights into the substrate recognition and transport mechanisms of ABCG25 in Arabidopsis, and facilitate our understanding of the ABA transport and signalling pathway in plants.",

Transcription factor (TF) regulates a large number of downstream target genes and is a key determinant of all physiological activities, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell cycle. The transcription factor E2F1 shows prominent roles in EC. BMI1 is a member of Polycomb suppressor Complex 1 (PRC1) and has been shown to be associated with EC invasiveness. It is currently unclear whether E2F1 can participate in the proliferation, migration, and invasion processes of EC cells by regulating BMI1 transcription.",

        "Title": "Chinese giant salamander Bcl-w: An inhibitory role in iridovirus-induced mitochondrial apoptosis and virus replication.",
        "Abstract": "B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) superfamily molecules play crucial roles in mitochondrial apoptosis induced by Chinese giant salamander iridovirus (GSIV). As an anti-apoptotic molecule in the BCL-2 family, the molecular mechanism of Bcl-w during GSIV infection remains unknown. In this study, we characterized for the first time an amphibian Bcl-w from Chinese giant salamander Andrias davidianus (AdBcl-w), and its function and regulatory mechanism during GSIV infection were investigated. AdBcl-w possesses the conserved structural features of Bcl-w and shares 35-54% sequence identities with other Bcl-w. mRNA expression of AdBcl-w was most abundant in liver and muscle. The AdBcl-w mRNA expression was regulated during GSIV infection. Western blotting assays revealed that the level of Bcl-w protein was downregulated markedly as the infection progresses. Confocal microscopy showed that overexpressed AdBcl-w was translocated to the mitochondria after infection with GSIV. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that compared with control, the apoptotic progress in cells transfected with AdBcl-w was reduced while that in cells transfected with AdBcl-w siRNA was enhanced. The number of virus major capsid protein gene copies was lower and protein synthesis was reduced in AdBcl-w overexpressing cells. In addition, AdBcl-w could bind directly to the pro-apoptotic molecule AdBak, while this interaction was weakened with GSIV infection. Moreover, p53 level was reduced and the mRNA expression levels of crucial regulatory molecules in the p53 pathway were regulated in AdBcl-w overexpressing cells during GSIV infection. These results suggested that AdBcl-w inhibit GSIV replication by regulating the virus induced mitochondrial apoptosis.",

        "Abstract": "Reciprocal interactions between alveolar fibroblasts and epithelial cells are crucial for lung homeostasis, injury repair, and fibrogenesis, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this, we administered the fibroblast-selective TGF\u03b21 signaling inhibitor, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), to Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) patients undergoing diagnostic lung biopsy and conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on spare tissue. Unexposed biopsy samples showed higher fibroblast TGF\u03b21 signaling compared to non-disease donor or end-stage ILD tissues. In vivo, EGCG significantly downregulated TGF\u03b21 signaling and several pro-inflammatory and stress pathways in biopsy samples. Notably, EGCG reduced fibroblast secreted Frizzle-like Receptor Protein 2 (sFRP2), an unrecognized TGF\u03b21 fibroblast target gene induced near type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s). In human AEC2-fibroblast coculture organoids, sFRP2 was essential for AEC2 trans-differentiation to basal cells. Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) from normal donors demonstrated that TGF\u03b21 promoted KRT17 expression and AEC2 morphological change, while sFRP2 was necessary for KRT5 expression in AEC2-derived basaloid cells. Wnt-receptor Frizzled 5 (Fzd5) expression and downstream calcineurin-related signaling in AEC2s were required for sFRP2-induced KRT5 expression. These findings highlight stage-specific TGF\u03b21 signaling in ILD, the therapeutic potential of EGCG in reducing IPF-related transcriptional changes, and identify the TGF\u03b21-non-canonical Wnt pathway crosstalk via sFRP2 as a novel mechanism for dysfunctional epithelial signaling in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis/ILD.",

        "Abstract": "Chinese giant salamander iridovirus (GSIV) is the first known and causative viral pathogen in Andrias davidianus. Developing a sensitive, accurate and specific assay to detect GSIV in samples is essential to prevent the further spread of the pathogen. In this study, we established a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay that targeted the mcp gene of GSIV, enabling rapid and quantitative detection of the virus. We determined that the optimal annealing temperature, primer concentration and probe concentration were 57.1\u00b0C, 50\u2009nM and 500\u2009nM, respectively. We analysed the specificity and sensitivity of the ddPCR assay and found that five common aquatic animal viruses, including Cyprinid herpesvirus 2 (CyHV-2), infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), Koi herpesvirus (KHV) and Carp Edema Virus (CEV) displayed negative results based on this GSIV ddPCR assay. The assay can detect GSIV with the lowest detection limit of 3.7 copies per reaction. To evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of the ddPCR assay, we tested different infected tissue samples with both the ddPCR and TaqMan real-time PCR assays. Our results showed that the ddPCR assay detected GSIV in all samples with 100% positivity, while the TaqMan real-time PCR assay detected GSIV in only 82.1% of samples. The established ddPCR method provided several advantages in detecting GISV, including high sensitivity, high precision and absolute quantification, making it a powerful tool for detection of possible and potential GSIV infection, even in samples with low viral load.",

        "Abstract": "Fast and low-dose reconstructions of medical images are highly desired in clinical routines. We propose a hybrid deep-learning and iterative reconstruction (hybrid DL-IR) framework and apply it for fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fast positron emission tomography (PET), and low-dose computed tomography (CT) image generation tasks. First, in a retrospective MRI study (6,066 cases), we demonstrate its capability of handling 3- to 10-fold under-sampled MR data, enabling organ-level coverage with only 10- to 100-s scan time; second, a low-dose CT study (142 cases) shows that our framework can successfully alleviate the noise and streak artifacts in scans performed with only 10% radiation dose (0.61 mGy); and last, a fast whole-body PET study (131 cases) allows us to faithfully reconstruct tumor-induced lesions, including small ones (<4\u00a0mm), from 2- to 4-fold-accelerated PET acquisition (30-60 s/bp). This study offers a promising avenue for accurate and high-quality image reconstruction with broad clinical value.",

        "Title": "Supervised structural learning of semiparametric regression on high-dimensional correlated covariates with applications to eQTL studies.",
        "Abstract": "Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies utilize regression models to explain the variance of gene expressions with genetic loci or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, regression models for eQTL are challenged by the presence of high dimensional non-sparse and correlated SNPs with small effects, and nonlinear relationships between responses and SNPs. Principal component analyses are commonly conducted for dimension reduction without considering responses. Because of that, this non-supervised learning method often does not work well when the focus is on discovery of the response-covariate relationship. We propose a new supervised structural dimensional reduction method for semiparametric regression models with high dimensional and correlated covariates; we extract low-dimensional latent features from a vast number of correlated SNPs while accounting for their relationships, possibly nonlinear, with gene expressions. Our model identifies important SNPs associated with gene expressions and estimates the association parameters via a likelihood-based algorithm. A GTEx data application on a cancer related gene is presented with 18 novel eQTLs detected by our method. In addition, extensive simulations show that our method outperforms the other competing methods in bias, efficiency, and computational cost.",

        "Abstract": "Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), which are a critical component of viperid and crotalid venoms, play various important roles in the pathogenesis of snakebite envenomation. The SVMPs from elapid venoms are not well elucidated, as compared with those from viperid and crotalid venoms. Atrase A is a nonhemorrhagic P-III SVMP purified from Naja atra venom that possesses only weak fibrinogenolytic activity. In our prior study, we found that atrase A detached adherent cells from the substrate. In this work, we investigated further the effect and mechanism of atrase A on endothelial cells. Oxidative damage, inflammatory mediators, apoptosis, and activation of the NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways were measured after HMEC-1\u00a0cells were exposed to atrase A. The results showed that HMEC-1\u00a0cells released inflammatory mediators, exihibited oxidative damage and apoptosis after exposure to atrase A. The Western blot analysis results revealed that atrase A increased Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-3 levels and activated the NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways in endothelial cells. The effects on endothelial cells were nearly completely abolished after atrase A was treated with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. These results showed that atrase A led to an inflammatory response, cellular injury and apoptosis in endothelial cells, and this effect was due to its metalloproteinase domain. The study contributes to a better understanding of the structures and functions of cobra venom P-III class metalloproteinases.",

        "Abstract": "Allergies have become an emerging public health problem worldwide. The most effective way to prevent allergies is to find the causative allergen at the source and avoid re-exposure. However, most of the current computational methods used to identify allergens were based on homology or conventional machine learning methods, which were inefficient and still had room to be improved for the detection of allergens with low homology. In addition, few methods based on deep learning were reported, although deep learning has been successfully applied to several tasks in protein sequence analysis. In the present work, a deep neural network-based model, called DeepAlgPro, was proposed to identify allergens. We showed its great accuracy and applicability to large-scale forecasts by comparing it to other available tools. Additionally, we used ablation experiments to demonstrate the critical importance of the convolutional module in our model. Moreover, further analyses showed that epitope features contributed to model decision-making, thus improving the model's interpretability. Finally, we found that DeepAlgPro was capable of detecting potential new allergens. Overall, DeepAlgPro can serve as powerful software for identifying allergens.",

        "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for biomarkers important for clinical phenotypes can lead to clinically relevant discoveries. GWAS for quantitative traits are based on simplified regression models modeling the conditional mean of a phenotype as a linear function of genotype. An alternative and easy to apply approach is quantile regression that naturally extends linear regression to the analysis of the entire conditional distribution of a phenotype of interest by modeling conditional quantiles within a regression framework. Quantile regression can be applied efficiently at biobank scale using standard statistical packages in much the same way as linear regression, while having some unique advantages such as identifying variants with heterogeneous effects across different quantiles, including non-additive effects and variants involved in gene-environment interactions; accommodating a wide range of phenotype distributions with invariance to trait transformation; and overall providing more detailed information about the underlying genotype-phenotype associations. Here, we demonstrate the value of quantile regression in the context of GWAS by applying it to 39 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank (",

        "Abstract": "The risk for motor and cognitive impairment is increased in patients with chronic pontine infarction (PI). In this study, we attempted to explore the alterations of neurovascular coupling (NVC) in order to understand the neural basis of behavioral impairment after PI. Three-dimensional pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (3D-pcASL) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) were applied in 49 patients with unilateral PI (left-sided, n\u00a0=\u00a026; right-sided, n\u00a0=\u00a023) and 30 matched normal subjects to assess whole-brain cerebral blood flow (CBF) and functional connectivity strength (FCS). We evaluated NVC in each subject by calculating the correlation coefficient between the whole-brain CBF and FCS (CBF-FCS coupling) and the ratio between voxel-wise CBF and FCS (CBF/FCS ratio). The FCS maps were then divided into long-range and short-range FCS to identify the influence of connection distance. The results indicated that the CBF-FCS coupling in the whole-brain level was significantly interrupted in PI patients, and the CBF/FCS ratio in cognition-related brain regions was abnormal. Distance-dependent results demonstrated that PI had a more serious effect on long-range neurovascular coupling. Correlation analysis revealed that the changes in neurovascular coupling were correlated with working memory scores. These findings imply that disruption of neurovascular coupling in the remote-infarction brain regions may underlie the impaired cognitive functions in chronic PI.",

        "Abstract": "Macrocycles have attracted significant attention from academia due to their various applications in organic field-effect transistors, organic light-emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics, and dye-sensitized solar cells. Despite the existence of reports on the application of macrocycles in organic optoelectronic devices, these reports are mainly limited to analyzing the structure-property relationship of a particular type of macrocyclic structure, and a systematic discussion on the structure-property is still lacking. Herein, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of a series of macrocycle structures to identify the key factors that affect the structure-property relationship between macrocycles and their optoelectronic device properties, including energy level structure, structural stability, film-forming property, skeleton rigidity, inherent pore structure, spatial hindrance, exclusion of perturbing end-effects, macrocycle size-dependent effects, and fullerene-like charge transport characteristics. These macrocycles exhibit thin-film and single-crystal hole mobility up to 10 and 26.8 cm",

        "Abstract": "Aminoglycoside antibiotics (AGAs) are widely used in life-threatening infections, but they accumulate in cochlear hair cells (HCs) and result in hearing loss. Increases in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations and P2X7 receptor expression were observed after neomycin treatment. Here, we demonstrated that P2X7 receptor, which is a non-selective cation channel that is activated by high ATP concentrations, may participate in the process through which AGAs enter hair cells. Using transgenic knockout mice, we found that P2X7 receptor deficiency protects HCs against neomycin-induced injury in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently, we used fluorescent gentamicin-Fluor 594 to study the uptake of AGAs and found fluorescence labeling in wild-type mice but not in P2rx7-/- mice in vitro. In addition, knocking-out P2rx7 did not significantly alter the HC count and auditory signal transduction, but it did inhibit mitochondria-dependent oxidative stress and apoptosis in the cochlea after neomycin exposure. We thus conclude that the P2X7 receptor may be linked to the entry of AGAs into HCs and is likely to be a therapeutic target for auditory HC protection.",

        "Abstract": "The phytohormone auxin plays central roles in many growth and developmental processes in plants. Development of chemical tools targeting the auxin pathway is useful for both plant biology and agriculture. Here we reveal that naproxen, a synthetic compound with anti-inflammatory activity in humans, acts as an auxin transport inhibitor targeting PIN-FORMED (PIN) transporters in plants. Physiological experiments indicate that exogenous naproxen treatment affects pleiotropic auxin-regulated developmental processes. Additional cellular and biochemical evidence indicates that naproxen suppresses auxin transport, specifically PIN-mediated auxin efflux. Moreover, biochemical and structural analyses confirm\u00a0that naproxen binds directly to PIN1 protein\u00a0via the same binding cavity as the indole-3-acetic acid substrate. Thus, by combining cellular, biochemical, and structural approaches, this study clearly establishes that naproxen is a PIN inhibitor and elucidates the underlying mechanisms. Further use of this compound may advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PIN-mediated auxin transport\u00a0and expand our toolkit in auxin biology and agriculture.",

        "Abstract": "Pulmonary fibrosis that occurs following lung injury is a progressive and fatal disease since continual damage to lung tissue triggers the dysregulated inflammation response and accompanying abnormal healing process. Pyroptosis of alveolar macrophages has been found to play an essential role in the deterioration of lung injury and fibrosis. However, the lack of inhibitors against this inflammatory cell death in macrophages and the dense stroma pose major barriers to lung injury and fibrosis treatment. Herein, we developed an albumin-based nanoformulation to realize active delivery of formononetin (FMN) to improve the treatment of lung injury and fibrosis. The obtained nanoparticle, FMN@BSA NPs, could efficiently accumulate at the impaired lesion benefiting from the leaky vasculatures and the affinity between albumin and the overexpressed SPARC protein. Through blocking the NLRP3 inflammasome-involved pyroptosis process of macrophages, FMN@BSA NPs remarkably improved lung function and prolonged animal survival in the bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury and fibrosis model without noticeable side effects. Meanwhile, we proved FMN as a pyroptosis inhibitor and the corresponding lipid metabolism-related mechanisms through multi-omics analysis. This study first employed an albumin-based nanoparticle to deliver the pyroptosis inhibitor to the impaired lung tissue actively, providing a promising strategy for lung injury and fibrosis treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis and stimulates glucose conversion to glycogen and lipids. How these activities are coordinated to prevent hypoglycemia and hepatosteatosis is unclear. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) is rate controlling for gluconeogenesis. However, inborn human FBP1 deficiency does not cause hypoglycemia unless accompanied by fasting or starvation, which also trigger paradoxical hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis, and hyperlipidemia. Hepatocyte FBP1-ablated mice exhibit identical fasting-conditional pathologies along with AKT hyperactivation, whose inhibition reversed hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis, and hyperlipidemia but not hypoglycemia. Surprisingly, fasting-mediated AKT hyperactivation is insulin dependent. Independently of its catalytic activity, FBP1 prevents insulin hyperresponsiveness by forming a stable complex with AKT, PP2A-C, and aldolase B (ALDOB), which specifically accelerates AKT dephosphorylation. Enhanced by fasting and weakened by elevated insulin, FBP1:PP2A-C:ALDOB:AKT complex formation, which is disrupted by human FBP1 deficiency mutations or a C-terminal FBP1 truncation, prevents insulin-triggered liver pathologies and maintains lipid and glucose homeostasis. Conversely, an FBP1-derived complex disrupting peptide reverses diet-induced insulin resistance.",

        "Abstract": "Aromatic ring fusion on BODIPY core can effectively tune its electronic property, and red-shift its absorption and emission wavelength. In this work, we report that a one-pot Pd(II) catalyzed multiple C-H activation to access acenaphtho[b]-fused BODIPYs though the reaction of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsubstituted-BODIPYs and 1,8-dibromonaphthalenes. These newly synthesized acenaphtho[b]-fused BODIPYs revealed intensified deep red absorptions (639-669\u2005nm) and emissions (643-683\u2005nm), with high fluorescence quantum yields (0.53-0.84) in dichloromethane. Notably, these acenaphtho[b]-fused BODIPYs exhibited well-defined self-aggregation behavior in water/THF mixture, and for instance, the absorption of 3\u2009a was red-shifted by 53\u2005nm to 693\u2005nm after forming aggregates.",

In this study, a star polycation (SPc)-based nanodelivery system was used for the first time to develop a thiophanate-methyl (TM) nanoagent for the management of V. dahliae. SPc spontaneously assembled with TM through hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals forces to decrease the particle size of TM from 834 to 86\u00a0nm. Compared to TM alone, the SPc-loaded TM further reduced the colony diameter of V. dahliae to 1.12 and 0.64\u00a0cm, and the spore number to 1.13\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010",

        "Title": "Irrigating degradation properties of silk fibroin-collagen type II composite cartilage scaffold in vitro and in vivo.",
        "Abstract": "Silk fibroin-collagen type II scaffolds are promising in cartilage tissue engineering due to their suitable biological functionality to promote proliferation of chondrocytes in vitro. However, their degradation properties, which are of crucial importance as scaffold degradation should consistent with the new tissue formation process, are still unknown. In this study, degradability of silk fibroin-collagen type II cartilage scaffolds was probed both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro degradation experiments show that the scaffolds decreased 32.25\u00a0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.62\u00a0%, 34.27\u00a0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.96\u00a0%, 36.27\u00a0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.39\u00a0% in weight after 8\u00a0weeks of degradation at the irrigation velocity of 0\u00a0mL/min, 7.89\u00a0mL/min and 15.79\u00a0mL/min. The degradation ratio, which increases with time and increasing irrigation velocity, is described by combining the built mathematic model and finite element modeling method. The scaffolds after 8\u00a0weeks of degradation in vitro keep their mechanical structural integrity to support new tissues. In vivo degradation experiments conducted in rabbits further show that the scaffolds degrade gradually, be absorbed with time and finally collapse in structure. The degradation process is accompanied by the growth of fibrous tissues and the scaffold is filled by fibrous tissues after 12\u00a0weeks of implantation. Immunohistology analysis shows that the inflammation caused by scaffolds is controllable and gradually alleviates with time. To sum up, silk fibroin-collagen type II cartilage scaffolds, which show suitable mechanical properties and biocompatibility during degradation in vitro and in vivo, have great potential in cartilage repair. The novelty of the study is that it not only introduces a mathematical model to predict the irrigation degradation ratio, but also provides experimental degradation data support for clinical application of silk fibroin-collagen type II cartilage scaffolds.",

        "Abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have long been sought as therapeutic targets for EOC, as they are frequently hyperactivated in primary tumors and drive disease relapse, progression, and metastasis. More recently, these oncogenic drivers have been implicated in EOC response to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and epigenome-interfering agents. This evidence revives RTKs as promising targets for therapeutic intervention of EOC. This review summarizes recent studies on the role of RTKs in EOC malignancy and the use of their inhibitors for clinical treatment. Our focus is on the ERBB family, c-Met, and VEGFR, as they are linked to drug resistance and targetable using commercially available drugs. The importance of these RTKs and their inhibitors is highlighted by their impact on signal transduction and intratumoral heterogeneity in EOC and successful use as maintenance therapy in the clinic through suppression of the VEGF/VEGFR axis. Finally, the therapeutic potential of RTK inhibitors is discussed in the context of combinatorial targeting via co-inhibiting proliferative and anti-apoptotic pathways, epigenomic/transcriptional programs, and harnessing the efficacy of PARP inhibitors and programmed cell death 1/ligand 1 immune checkpoint therapies.",

        "Title": "A multiple controlled-release hydrophilicity minocycline hydrochloride delivery system for the efficient treatment of periodontitis.",
        "Abstract": "The complexity of periodontitis, including the complex formation mechanisms and the complex periodontium physiological environment, as well as the complex association with multiple complications, often results in poor therapy effects. Herein, we aimed to design a nanosystem with a controlled release of minocycline hydrochloride (MH) and good retention to effectively treat periodontitis by inhibiting inflammation and repairing the alveolar bone. Firstly, insoluble ion-pairing (IIP) complexes were constructed to improve the encapsulation efficiency of hydrophilic MH in PLGA nanoparticles. Then, a nanogenerator was constructed and combined with a double emulsion method to encapsulate the complexes into PLGA nanoparticles (MH-NPs). The average particle size of MH-NPs was about 100\u00a0nm as observed by AFM and TEM, and the drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were 9.59% and 95.58%, respectively. Finally, a multifunctional system (MH-NPs-in-gels) was prepared by dispersing MH-NPs into thermosensitive gels, which could continue to release drug for 21\u00a0days in vitro. And the release mechanism showed that this controlled release behavior for MH was influenced by the insoluble ion-pairing complex, PLGA nanoparticles, and gels. In addition, the periodontitis rat model was established to investigate the pharmacodynamic effects. After 4\u00a0weeks of treatment, changes in the alveolar bone were assessed by Micro-CT (BV/TV: 70.88%; BMD: 0.97\u00a0g/cm",

        "Title": "Antibacterial-Anti-Inflammatory-Bone Restoration Procedure Achieved by MIN-Loaded PLGA Microsphere for Efficient Treatment of Periodontitis.",
        "Abstract": "The main development process of periodontitis involves periodontal pathogenic bacteria as the initiating factor causing the onset of destructive inflammation, which in turn stimulates the destruction of periodontal tissue. It is difficult to achieve the eradication of periodontitis due to the complex interaction among antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and bone restoration. Herein, we propose an antibacterial-anti-inflammatory-bone restoration procedural treatment strategy with minocycline (MIN) for the efficient treatment of periodontitis. In brief, MIN was prepared into PLGA microspheres with tunable release behavior using different species of PLGA, respectively. The optimally selected PLGA microspheres (LA:GA with 50:50, 10\u00a0kDa, and carboxyl group) had a drug loading of 16.91%, an in vitro release of approximately 30\u00a0days, which also had a particle size of approximately 11.8\u00a0\u00b5m with a smooth appearance and a rounded morphology. The DSC and XRD results showed that the MIN was completely encapsulated in the microspheres as an amorphous state. Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated the safety and biocompatibility of the microspheres (cell viabilities at a concentration of 1-200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL were greater than 97%), and in vitro bacterial inhibition tests showed that the selected microspheres could achieve effective bacterial inhibition at the initial stage after administration. The favorable anti-inflammatory (low TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 levels) and bone restoration effects (BV/TV: 71.8869%; BMD: 0.9782\u00a0g/cm",

        "Abstract": "Identifying a patient's disease/health status from electronic medical records is a frequently encountered task in electronic health records (EHR) related research, and estimation of a classification model often requires a benchmark training data with patients' known phenotype statuses. However, assessing a patient's phenotype is costly and labor intensive, hence a proper selection of EHR records as a training set is desired. We propose a procedure to tailor the best training subsample with limited sample size for a classification model, minimizing its mean-squared phenotyping/classification error (MSE). Our approach incorporates \"positive only\" information, an approximation of the true disease status without false alarm, when it is available. In addition, our sampling procedure is applicable for training a chosen classification model which can be misspecified. We provide theoretical justification on its optimality in terms of MSE. The performance gain from our method is illustrated through simulation and a real-data example, and is found often satisfactory under criteria beyond\u00a0MSE.",

        "Abstract": "As an essential structural, metabolic and signaling element, calcium shows low remobilization from old to young tissues in plants, restricting the nutrient-use efficiency and control efficacy against mosaic virus disease. Nanotechnology has been applied to prevent/minimize nutrient losses and improve the accessibility of poorly-available nutrients. Herein, the current study applied a star polycation (SPc) to prepare a calcium nutrition nanoagent. The SPc could assemble with calcium glycinate through hydrogen bond and Van der Waals force, forming stable spherical particles with nanoscale size (17.72 nm). Transcriptomic results revealed that the calcium glycinate/SPc complex could activate the expression of many transport-related genes and disease resistance genes in tomatoes, suggesting the enhanced transport and antiviral immunity of SPc-loaded calcium glycinate. Reasonably, the calcium transport was accelerated by 3.17 times into tomato leaves with the help of SPc, and the protective effect of calcium glycinate was remarkably improved to 77.40% and 67.31% toward tomato mosaic virus with the help of SPc after the third and fifth applications. Furthermore, SPc-loaded calcium glycinate could be applied to increase the leaf photosynthetic rate and control the unusual fast growth of tomatoes. The current study is the first success to apply nano-delivery system for enhanced calcium transport and antiviral immunity, which is beneficial for increasing nutrient-use efficiency and shows good prospects for field application.",

        "Abstract": "Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are highly specialized neural cells with several functions essential for vision. Progressive deterioration of RPE cells in elderly individuals can result in visual impairment and, ultimately, blinding disease. While human embryonic stem cell-derived RPE cell (hESC-RPE) growth conditions are generally harsher than those of cell lines, the subretinal transplantation of hESC-RPE is being clinically explored as a strategy to recover the damaged retina and improve vision. The cell-adhesion ability of the support is required for RPE transplantation, where pre-polarized cells can maintain specific functions on the scaffold. This work examined four typical biodegradable hydrogels as supports for hESC-RPE growth.",

Capturing post-surgical changes necessitates a well-established cortical shape correspondence between pre- and post-surgical surfaces. Yet, most cortical surface registration methods are designed for normal neuroanatomy. Surgical changes can introduce wide ranging artifacts in correspondence, for which conventional surface registration methods may not work as intended.",

        "Abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes severe gastroenteritis. The 5'-nucleotidases of pathogens can dephosphorylate adenosine phosphates, boost adenosine levels and suppress the pro-inflammatory immune response. In our previous study, an extracellular nuclease, 5'-nucleotidase, was identified in the extracellular proteins of S. Typhimurium. However, the nuclease activity and the function of the 5'-nucleotidase of S. Typhimurium have not been explored. In the present study, deletion of the 5'-nucleotidase gene is dispensable for S. Typhimurium growth, even under environmental stress. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that the 5'-nucleotidase mutant induced more macrophage extracellular traps (METs) than the wild type did. Furthermore, recombinant 5'-nucleotidase protein (r5Nuc) could degrade \u03bbDNA, and the nuclease activity of r5Nuc was optimum at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 6.0-7.0. The Mg",

        "Abstract": "With rapid worldwide spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), jointly identifying severe COVID-19 cases from mild ones and predicting the conversion time (from mild to severe) is essential to optimize the workflow and reduce the clinician's workload. In this study, we propose a novel framework for COVID-19 diagnosis, termed as Structural Attention Graph Neural Network (SAGNN), which can combine the multi-source information including features extracted from chest CT, latent lung structural distribution, and non-imaging patient information to conduct diagnosis of COVID-19 severity and predict the conversion time from mild to severe. Specifically, we first construct a graph to incorporate structural information of the lung and adopt graph attention network to iteratively update representations of lung segments. To distinguish different infection degrees of left and right lungs, we further introduce a structural attention mechanism. Finally, we introduce demographic information and develop a multi-task learning framework to jointly perform both tasks of classification and regression. Experiments are conducted on a real dataset with 1687 chest CT scans, which includes 1328 mild cases and 359 severe cases. Experimental results show that our method achieves the best classification (e.g., 86.86% in terms of Area Under Curve) and regression (e.g., 0.58 in terms of Correlation Coefficient) performance, compared with other comparison methods.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate segmentation of subcortical structures is an important task in quantitative brain image analysis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable results in medical image segmentation. However, due to the difficulty of acquiring high-quality annotations of brain subcortical structures, learning segmentation networks using noisy annotations is an inevitable topic. A common practice is to select images or pixels with reliable annotations for training, which usually may not make full use of the information from the training samples, thus affecting the performance of the learned segmentation model. To address the above problem, in this work, we propose a novel robust learning method and denote it as uncertainty-reliability awareness learning (URAL), which can make sufficient use of all training pixels. At each training iteration, the proposed method first selects training pixels with reliable annotations from the set of pixels with uncertain network prediction, by utilizing a small clean validation set following a meta-learning paradigm. Meanwhile, we propose the online prototypical soft label correction (PSLC) method to estimate the pseudo-labels of label-unreliable pixels. Then, the segmentation loss of label-reliable pixels and the semi-supervised segmentation loss of label-unreliable pixels are used to calibrate the total segmentation loss. Finally, we propose a category-wise contrastive regularization to learn compact feature representations of all uncertain training pixels. Comprehensive experiments are performed on two publicly available brain MRI datasets. The proposed method achieves the best Dice scores and MHD values on both datasets compared to several recent state-of-the-art methods under all label noise settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/neulxlx/URAL.",

In this work, conductive silver pastes with excellent comprehensive performances were developed by using water-borne polyurethane (WPU) as the bonding phase and using the ternary mixture of Ag microflakes (Ag MFs), Ag nanowires (Ag NWs), and Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as the conductive phase. WPU endowed conductive silver pastes with the adhesion along with releasing a few VOCs during the curing. Results showed that a small amount of Ag NPs or Ag NWs dramatically enhanced the electrical conductivity of silver paste paint film filled only with Ag MFs. The electrical resistivity for optimal ternary mixture conductive silver paste was 0.2 \u00d7 10",

        "Abstract": "The microstructure of materials importantly affects their performance. As electrocatalyst materials, the performance of hollow-structure materials is usually better than that of solid materials because of the larger specific surface area, lower density, and more exposed active sites of hollow structure. Bimetallic catalysts usually exhibit better catalytic activity than monometallic catalysts because of the synergistic effects between different metal elements. Prussian blue and its analogues (PB/PBAs) are ideal precursors for preparing hollow-structure bimetallic catalysts due to their structure and composition characteristics. In this study, ZIF-67 hollow sphere (HS) was used as the template to prepare hierarchical hollow CoFePBA (H-SCP) through anion-exchange method. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance of H-SCP was further improved by low-temperature heat treatment in N",

Instead of designing prototype filters separately, we propose to model the filter bank design problem as a nonlinear programming problem and jointly design the prototype filters in the FRM structure. Moreover, in this work, all the filters are designed directly in the finite wordlength space, such that they can be directly implemented using efficient fixed-point arithmetic without any quantization. By simultaneously considering all the subband constraints during optimization, the proposed method is able to guarantee the desirable stopband attenuation for all subbands and achieve optimal effective wordlength (EWL) for the coefficients, reducing the hardware complexity for very large-scale integration (VLSI) implementation. Experimental results show that the hardware complexity of filter banks can be reduced without sacrificing the audiogram compensation performance for hearing aid applications.",

The method is flexible enough to depict complex and nonlinear associations between the covariates and the quantiles of the outcome. We establish the theoretical properties of the estimated quantiles, and develop inference tools to assess the quantile effects. Extensive simulation studies indicate that the novel method generally outperforms existing zero-inflated approaches and the direct quantile regression in terms of the estimation and inference of the heterogeneous effect of the covariates. The approach is applied to data from the Northern Manhattan Study to identify risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis, measured by the ultrasound carotid plaque burden.",

        "Abstract": "In radiotherapy for cancer patients, an indispensable process is to delineate organs-at-risk (OARs) and tumors. However, it is the most time-consuming step as manual delineation is always required from radiation oncologists. Herein, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for radiotherapy treatment planning (RTP), named RTP-Net, to promote an automatic, rapid, and precise initialization of whole-body OARs and tumors. Briefly, the framework implements a cascade coarse-to-fine segmentation, with adaptive module for both small and large organs, and attention mechanisms for organs and boundaries. Our experiments show three merits: 1) Extensively evaluates on 67 delineation tasks on a large-scale dataset of 28,581 cases; 2) Demonstrates comparable or superior accuracy with an average Dice of 0.95; 3) Achieves near real-time delineation in most tasks with <2\u2009s. This framework could be utilized to accelerate the contouring process in the All-in-One radiotherapy scheme, and thus greatly shorten the turnaround time of patients.",

        "Title": "A nano-delivery system expands the insecticidal target of thiamethoxam to include a devastating pest, the fall armyworm.",
        "Abstract": "Nano-delivery systems have been applied to deliver various synthetic/botanical pesticides to increase the efficiency of pesticide use and reduce the volumes of pesticides applied. Previous studies have supported the hypothesis that the nanocarriers can help expand the insecticidal target of pesticides to include non-target pests. However, the potential mechanism underlying this interesting phenomenon remains unclear. Herein, a widely applied star polycation (SPc) nanocarrier was synthesized to construct a thiamethoxam (TMX) nano-delivery system. The SPc-based delivery system could promote the translocation of exogenous substances across the membrane of Sf9 cells, increase the cytotoxicity of TMX against Sf9 cells by nearly 20%, and expand the insecticidal target of TMX to include Spodoptera frugiperda (the fall armyworm), with a 27.5% mortality increase at a concentration of 0.25\u00a0mg/mL. Moreover, the RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that the SPc could upregulate various transport-related genes, such as Rab, SORT1, CYTH, and PIKfyve, for the enhanced cellular uptake of TMX. Furthermore, enhanced cell death in larvae treated with the TMX-SPc complex was observed through changes in the expression levels of death-related genes, such as Casp7, BIRC5, MSK1, and PGAM5. The SPc-based nano-delivery system improved the cellular uptake of TMX and expanded its insecticidal target by adjusting the expression levels of death-related genes. The current study mainly identified the transport and cell death genes related to nanocarrier-based insecticidal target expansion, which is beneficial for understanding the bioactivity enhancement of the nano-delivery system.",

        "Abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on individuals' mental health. This study aimed to investigate how negative emotions toward the COVID-19 pandemic, including feeling anxious, depressed, upset, and stressed, were associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Sweden. The study is a cross-sectional online survey conducted between 21-28 May 2021, using three nested hierarchical logistic regression models to assess the association. The study included 965 unvaccinated individuals, 51.2% (n = 494) of whom reported their intention to get vaccinated. We observed graded positive associations between reported negative emotions and vaccine acceptance. Individuals who experienced economic stress had lower odds of vaccine acceptance while having a positive opinion of the government's response to COVID-19 was associated with higher odds of being vaccine-acceptant. In conclusion, unvaccinated individuals experiencing negative emotions about the pandemic were more willing to get the vaccine. On the contrary, those with a negative opinion about the government's response, and those that had experienced economic stress were less likely to accept the immunization.",

        "Abstract": "Whole-organ transcriptomic analyses have emerged as a common method for characterizing developmental transitions in mammalian organs. However, it is unclear if all cell types in an organ follow the whole-organ defined developmental trajectory. Recently, a postnatal two-stage developmental process was described for the mouse stomach. Here, using laser capture microdissection to\u00a0obtain in\u2009situ transcriptomic data, we show that mouse gastric pit cells exhibit four postnatal developmental stages. Interestingly, early stages are\u00a0characterized by the up-regulation of genes associated with metabolism, a functionality not typically associated with pit cells. Hence, beyond revealing that not all constituent cells develop according to the whole-organ determined pathway, these results broaden our understanding of the pit cell phenotypic landscape during stomach development.",

        "Abstract": "Estrogen substances in the environment are increasing dramatically, which interfere with the normal hormone level of human body, lead to the disorder of endocrine system and even cancer. It is difficult to screen a large number of environmental estrogen substances by existing estrogen effect detection methods, and the results are often affected by many factors, thus the development of new method has become an urgent task. Electrochemical method is promising to reflect cell proliferation by tracking intracellular purine bases directly. In this study, the estrogen level in MCF-7\u00a0cells on multiwall carbon nanotubes modified glassy carbon electrode (MWCNTs/GCE) could be tracked simply and conveniently, and the estrogen effect of estradiol could be reflected by electrochemistry in time and dose-dependent manners. Electrochemical method displayed the best tolerance to culture factors, such as different cell densities, serum types, culture medium types and serum estrogen-free methods, which responsed to estrogen effect higher than MTT (about 40%) and cell counting methods (about 50%). Further Western blotting analysis showed that the estrogen effect of estradiol promoted purine catabolism and up-regulated guanine deaminase (GDA) and adenine deaminase (ADA) expression, the key enzymes of purine catabolism pathway, in a dose-dependent manner. The up-regulation of GDA and ADA led to the increase of intracellular guanine and xanthine, which enhanced the electrochemical signal derived from guanine and xanthine.",

        "Abstract": "Some heavy metals in the environment may have estrogen-like activity, which probably lead to major diseases such as breast cancer. It is of great importance to establish new methods to evaluate the estrogen effect of heavy metals from multiple angles due to the complex mechanism of estrogen effect. In this paper, using MCF-7\u00a0cells as model, the electrochemical detection mechanism of the estrogen effect of heavy metal cadmium (Cd) was studied. The two electrochemical signals of MCF-7\u00a0cells derived from uric acid (0.30\u00a0V) and the mixture of guanine and xanthine (0.68\u00a0V) increased in a time and dose-dependent manner when MCF-7\u00a0cells induced by Cd, reaching the maximum at 96\u00a0h and 10",

Generally, templates constructed from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a group of subjects can provide a standard reference space for analyzing the structural and functional characteristics of the group. With recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, it is desirable to explore AI registration methods for quantifying age-specific brain variations and tendencies across different ages. In this article, we present an AI-based age-specific template construction (called ASTC) framework for longitudinal structural brain analysis using T1-weighted MRIs of 646 subjects from 18 to 82\u2009years old collected from four medical centers. Altogether, 13 longitudinal templates were constructed at a 5-year age interval using ASTC, and tissue segmentation and substructure parcellation were performed for analysis across different age groups. The results indicated consistent changes in brain structures along with aging and demonstrated the capability of ASTC for longitudinal neuroimaging study.",

        "Abstract": "Alcohol can cause injury and lead to an inflammatory response in the liver. The NF-\u03baB/AMPK signaling pathway plays a vital role in regulating intracellular inflammatory cytokine levels. In this study, corn oligopeptides (CPs), as the research objects, were obtained from corn gluten meal, and their regulation of the activation of the Kupffer cell NF-\u03baB/AMPK signal pathway induced by LPS was investigated. Results showed that ALT, AST, and inflammatory cytokines in mice serum after the administration of CPs at 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g/kg of body weight displayed a distinct (p < 0.05) reduction. On the other hand, the CPs also inhibited the expression of recognized receptor CD14 and TLR4, down-regulated P-JNK, P-ERK, and P-p-38, and thus inhibited inflammatory cytokine levels in Kupffer cells (KCs). Furthermore, four kinds of dipeptides with a leucine residue at the C-terminus that might exhibit down-regulated inflammatory cytokines in the NF-\u03baB/AMPK signaling pathway functions were detected using HPLC-MS/MS. These results indicated that CPs have a potential application value in acute alcoholic liver disease.",

        "Abstract": "Ketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). We have shown that ketamine can induce cognitive impairments and schizophrenia-like symptoms in mice. However, the detailed metabolic profile changes in the progression of ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like symptoms are still not fully elucidated. In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry-based untargeted hippocampus high-throughput metabolomics method was first performed to screen for potential biomarkers in a schizophrenia-like state in a chronically administered ketamine-induced mouse model. Our results identified that the amino acid and energy metabolism pathways were significantly affected in mouse models of ketamine-induced schizophrenia. The detailed amino acid profiles were subsequently quantified in the hippocampus. The results showed that ketamine dramatically decreased the Lys, Gly, and Ser levels while significantly increasing the Gln level and relative Glu-to-GABA ratio. Our study suggested that Gln, Gly and Ser metabolism disturbances might be involved in ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like phenotypes. This research offers a fresh viewpoint for creating new neuroleptic medications and contributes to understanding the mechanisms underlying ketamine-induced schizophrenia.",

        "Abstract": "Automatic brain structure segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) plays an important role in the diagnosis of various neuropsychiatric diseases. However, most existing methods yield unsatisfactory results due to blurred boundaries and complex structures. Improving the segmentation ability requires the model to be explicit about the spatial localization and shape appearance of targets, which correspond to the low-frequency content features and the high-frequency edge features, respectively. Therefore, in this paper, to extract rich edge and content feature representations, we focus on the composition of the feature and utilize a frequency decoupling (FD) block to separate the low-frequency and high-frequency parts of the feature. Further, a novel edge-aware network (EA-Net) is proposed for jointly learning to segment brain structures and detect object edges. First, an encoder-decoder sub-network is utilized to obtain multi-level information from the input MRI, which is then sent to the FD block to complete the frequency separation. Further, we use different mechanisms to optimize both the low-frequency and high-frequency features. Finally, these two parts are fused to generate the final prediction. In particular, we extract the content mask and the edge mask from the optimization feature with different supervisions, which forces the network to learn the boundary features of the object. Extensive experiments are performed on two public brain MRI T1 scan datasets (the IBSR dataset and the MALC dataset) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experiments show that the EA-Net achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, and improves the segmentation DSC score by 1.31% at most compared with the U-Net model and its variants. Moreover, we evaluate the EA-Net under different noise disturbances, and the results demonstrate the robustness and superiority of our method under low-quality noisy MRI. Code is available at https://github.com/huqian999/EA-Net.",

        "Abstract": "Amomum villosum, serving as an important medicinal material, is complex in the genetic background of germplasm resources. Exploring the genetic diversity and genetic relationship of germplasm resources is conducive to clarifying the germplasm source and genetic background of A. villosum, so as to improve the efficiency of parent selection and variety breeding of A. villosum. Seventy-one pairs of SSR primers were used for PCR amplification of 84 A. villosum samples by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fifty-four pairs of SSR primers with high polymorphism were screened out for the analysis of genetic diversity. The results showed that 293 alleles were detected from 84 germplasm resources by 54 pairs of SSR primers, with an average of 5.32 alleles for each pair of primers, and a variation range of 3-8, and the primer AVL12 marked the highest number of alleles. The PIC value of each locus varied from 0.068 7 to 0.828 9, with an average of 0.529 9, and the highest was marked by AVL24. The genetic diversity of A. villosum was the highest in Yunnan, followed by Guangxi, and the lowest was found in Guangdong. The population structure analysis and cluster analysis showed that the samples were classified into two groups. In terms of origin, samples from Yunnan and Guangxi had a close genetic relationship, and there was no obvious differentiation of A, villosum resources from different origins. In this study, 54 pairs of SSR markers were used to analyze the genetic diversity and population structure of 84 germplasm resources, which can reflect the genetic relationship between A. villosum samples from different germplasm sources and different populations, thus providing a theoretical basis for the collection, research, and breeding of A. villosum resources.",

        "Abstract": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, was recently demonstrated to be closely associated with the immune system. Regulators of ferroptosis may be the cells and secretions of the immune system. Ferroptosis has contributed to the progression of various diseases, namely, cancer, ischemia, and degenerative diseases. However, research on the relationship between ferroptosis and asthma remains fragmented. Non-immune cells associated with asthma are also closely associated with ferroptosis. Further studies on cross-linking asthma inflammation with ferroptosis signaling pathways could help identify several key molecules, known as ferroptosis regulators, that regulate asthma. Ferroptosis provides a new perspective to interpret and understand the manifestations of asthma, potential drug discovery targets, and new therapeutic options to effectively intervene in the imbalance caused by abnormal inflammation in asthma. Thus, the pathogenesis of ferroptosis and its contribution to the pathogenesis of asthma is essential in deepening the understanding and improving the prognosis and cure rate of the patients. Herein, we introduce the main molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis and asthma, describe the relationship between ferroptosis and asthma based on their common regulatory cells or molecules, and discuss potential drug discovery targets and therapeutic applications of ferroptosis in the context of immunomodulation and symptom alleviation.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatocytes have important roles in liver iron homeostasis, abnormalities in which are tightly associated with liver steatosis and fibrosis. Here, we show that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) are characterized by iron-deficient hepatocytes and iron overload in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Iron deficiency enhances hepatocyte lipogenesis and insulin resistance through HIF2\u03b1-ATF4 signaling. Elevated secretion of iron-containing hepatocyte extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are normally cleared by Kupffer cells, accounts for hepatocyte iron deficiency and HSC iron overload in NAFLD/NASH livers. Iron accumulation results in overproduction of reactive oxygen species that promote HSC fibrogenic activation. Conversely, blocking hepatocyte EV secretion or depleting EV iron cargo restores liver iron homeostasis, concomitant with mitigation of NAFLD/NASH-associated liver steatosis and fibrosis. Taken together, these studies show that iron distribution disorders contribute to the development of liver metabolic diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most commonly inherited metabolic disease and has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Patients with FH usually present with high levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, xanthomas and early coronary artery disease. Children with FH are subject to developing early and enhanced atherosclerosis, leading to an increased risk of coronary events. We report here an 8-year-old patient with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who was diagnosed with homozygous FH (HoFH) due to mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene and subsequently treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) after filtration plasma. To the best of our knowledge, this patient is the youngest case of HoFH treated with filtration plasma followed by PTCA reported to date.",

        "Abstract": "Uncontrolled growth, distant metastasis and chemoresistance are critical characteristics of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and they result in high mortality; however, the mechanisms triggering these effects have not been fully investigated. In this study, we analysed a dataset in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified PCDH1, a rarely studied transmembrane protein, as a novel prognostic marker in PDAC patients. We demonstrated that PCDH1 expression was upregulated in PDAC tissues, and its expression levels were associated with the depth of tumour invasion and lymph node metastasis. Patients with high PCDH1 levels showed poor overall survival (OS). We also investigated the biological significance of PCDH1 in PDAC cell growth, metastasis, and side population (SP) phenotype acquisition and explored the internal molecular mechanisms of PCDH1 action. Our results demonstrated that PCDH1 enhanced p65 nuclear localization by interacting with KPNB1, a well-characterized nuclear transporter, thereby activating the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway and increasing its functional effects during PDAC progression. Hence, our results indicate that PCDH1 can be used as a negative prognostic marker and may be a potential therapeutic target for PDAC patients.",

        "Abstract": "Over the past decade, there has been growing enthusiasm for using electronic medical records (EMRs) for biomedical research. Quantile regression estimates distributional associations, providing unique insights into the intricacies and heterogeneity of the EMR data. However, the widespread nonignorable missing observations in EMR often obscure the true associations and challenge its potential for robust biomedical discoveries. We propose a novel method to estimate the covariate effects in the presence of nonignorable missing responses under quantile regression. This method imposes no parametric specifications on response distributions, which subtly uses implicit distributions induced by the corresponding quantile regression models. We show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. We also provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the proposed estimate and a randomly weighted bootstrap approach for statistical inferences. Numerical studies, including an empirical analysis of real-world EMR data, are used to assess the proposed method's finite-sample performance compared to existing\u00a0literature.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) escaping stressed mitochondria provokes inflammation via cGAS-STING pathway activation and, when oxidized (Ox-mtDNA), it binds cytosolic NLRP3, thereby triggering inflammasome activation. However, it is unknown how and in which form Ox-mtDNA exits stressed mitochondria in non-apoptotic macrophages. We found that diverse NLRP3 inflammasome activators rapidly stimulated uniporter-mediated calcium uptake to open mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTP) and trigger VDAC oligomerization. This occurred independently of mtDNA or reactive oxygen species, which induce Ox-mtDNA generation. Within mitochondria, Ox-mtDNA was either repaired by DNA glycosylase OGG1 or cleaved by the endonuclease FEN1 to 500-650\u00a0bp fragments that exited mitochondria via mPTP- and VDAC-dependent channels to initiate cytosolic NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Ox-mtDNA fragments also activated cGAS-STING signaling and gave rise to pro-inflammatory extracellular DNA. Understanding this process will advance the development of potential treatments for chronic inflammatory diseases, exemplified by FEN1 inhibitors that suppressed interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) production and mtDNA release in mice.",

        "Title": "Astrocyte Activation, but not Microglia, Is Associated with the Experimental Mouse Model of Schizophrenia Induced by Chronic Ketamine.",
        "Abstract": "Ketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Many experimental studies have shown that ketamine can induce cognitive impairments and schizophrenia-like symptoms. While much data have demonstrated that glial cells are associated with the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, the response of glial cells to ketamine and its significance to schizophrenia are not clear. The present study was intended to explore whether chronic ketamine treatment would induce behavioral and glial changes in mice. First, ketamine was used to stimulate behavioral abnormalities similar to schizophrenia evaluated by the open field test, elevated plus-maze test, Y maze test, novel object recognition test, and tail suspension test. Secondly, histopathology and Nissl staining were performed. Meanwhile, immunofluorescence was used to evaluate the expression levels of IBA-1 (a microglial marker) and GFAP (an astrocyte marker) in the mouse hippocampus for any change. Then, ELISA was used to analyze proinflammatory cytokine levels for any change. Our results showed that ketamine (25\u00a0mg/kg, i.p., qid, 12\u00a0days) induced anxiety, recognition deficits, and neuronal injury in the hippocampus. Moreover, chronic ketamine treatment enhanced GFAP expression in CA1 and DG regions of the hippocampus but did not influence the expression of IBA-1. Ketamine also increased the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in the mouse hippocampus. Our study created a new procedure for ketamine administration, which successfully induce negative symptoms and cognitive-behavioral defects in schizophrenia by chronic ketamine. This study further\u00a0revealed that an increase in astrocytosis, but not microglia, is associated with the mouse model of schizophrenia caused by ketamine. In summary, hippocampal astrocytes may be involved in the pathophysiology of ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like phenotypes through reactive transformation and regulation of neuroinflammation.",

Aimed at the cysteine (Cys) receptor on the surface of the Golgi apparatus, ligand-directed carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were synthesized for Golgi apparatus-targeting imaging. In order to reduce the interference of tissue self-fluorescence and enhance the tissue penetration depth, orange-emissive levorotatory CQDs (L-CQDs) with Golgi apparatus-targeting ability were synthesized using the strategy of inheriting Cys residues and the inherent conjugated electronic structure of neutral red. They exhibit excitation-dependent, fluorescence stability, rich surface Cys residues, excellent biocompatibility, and low toxicity.

        "Abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction in patients with infratentorial stroke has been paid little attention. Brainstem stroke may disrupt network connectivity across the whole brain and affect multidomain cognition, but the details of this process remain unclear. The study aimed to investigate the effects of stroke-induced pontine injury on whole-brain network connectivity and cognitive function. We included 47 patients with pontine stroke and 56 healthy comparisons (HC), who underwent cognitive tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Seven meaningful brain networks were identified using independent component analysis (ICA). Patients with pontine stroke had decreased intra-network functional connectivities (FCs) in the primary perceptual and higher cognitive control networks, including sensorimotor network (SMN), visual network (VIS), default mode network (DMN), and salience network (SAN), as well as decreased inter-network FCs in the primary perceptual (VIS-SMN) and higher cognitive control networks (bilateral frontoparietal networks, rFPN-lFPN). While the FCs between the primary perceptual and higher cognitive control networks (VIS-DMN, VIS-rFPN, VIS-lFPN) were increased. Furthermore, the alterations in these FCs correlated with patients' cognitive measurements. These findings suggested that the infratentorial stroke can induce dysfunctional connectivity in both primary perceptual and higher cognitive control networks at the whole-brain level, which may be attributable to the neural substrates of multidomain cognitive deficits in these patients.",

        "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a liver disease associated with significant morbidity. Kupffer cells (KCs) produce endogenous miR-690 and, via exosome secretion, shuttle this miRNA to other liver cells, such as hepatocytes, recruited hepatic macrophages (RHMs), and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). miR-690 directly inhibits fibrogenesis in HSCs, inflammation in RHMs, and de novo lipogenesis in hepatocytes. When an miR-690 mimic is administered to NASH mice in\u00a0vivo, all the features of the NASH phenotype are robustly inhibited. During the development of NASH, KCs become miR-690 deficient, and miR-690 levels are markedly lower in mouse and human NASH livers than in controls. KC-specific KO of miR-690 promotes NASH pathogenesis. A primary target of miR-690 is NADK mRNA, and NADK levels are inversely proportional to the cellular miR-690 content. These studies show that KCs play a central role in the etiology of NASH and raise the possibility that miR-690 could emerge as a therapeutic for this condition.",

        "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies demonstrate an association between breast cancer (BC) and systemic dysregulation of glucose metabolism. However, how BC influences glucose homeostasis remains unknown. We show that BC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) suppress pancreatic insulin secretion to impair glucose homeostasis. EV-encapsulated miR-122 targets PKM in \u03b2-cells to suppress glycolysis and ATP-dependent insulin exocytosis. Mice receiving high-miR-122 EVs or bearing BC tumours exhibit suppressed insulin secretion, enhanced endogenous glucose production, impaired glucose tolerance and fasting hyperglycaemia. These effects contribute to tumour growth and are abolished by inhibiting EV secretion or miR-122, restoring PKM in \u03b2-cells or supplementing insulin. Compared with non-cancer controls, patients with BC have higher levels of circulating EV-encapsulated miR-122 and fasting glucose concentrations but lower fasting insulin; miR-122 levels are positively associated with glucose and negatively associated with insulin. Therefore, EV-mediated impairment of whole-body glycaemic control may contribute to tumour progression and incidence of type 2 diabetes in some patients with BC.",

        "Abstract": "A microRNA (miRNA) often regulates the expression of hundreds of target genes. A fundamental question in the field of miRNA research is whether a miRNA exerts its biological function through regulating a small number of key targets or through small changes in the expression of hundreds of target genes. We addressed this issue by performing functional analysis of target genes regulated by miR-148a. We previously identified miR-148a as a critical regulator of B cell central tolerance and found 119 target genes that may mediate its function. We selected 4 of them for validation and demonstrated a regulatory role for ",

        "Abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis is a process characterized by extracellular matrix accumulation leading to myocardial dysfunction. Angiotensin II (Ang II) has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well established. Dysfunction of adipose tissue has been shown to promote remote organ injury, but its role in Ang II-induced cardiac remodeling is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) promoted Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis and subsequent cardiac dysfunction in an exosome-dependent manner. Both eWAT removal and administration of an inhibitor of exosome biogenesis strongly attenuated Ang II-induced abnormalities. Moreover, exosomes isolated from Ang II-stimulated adipocytes promoted cardiac\u00a0fibroblasts (CFs) activity. A mechanistic study identified that the miR-23a-3p level was significantly increased in exosomes derived from Ang II-challenged adipocytes and serum exosomes from Ang II-infused mice. Importantly, tail vein injection of ago-miR-23a-3p caused cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction, while antago-miR-23a-3p inhibited Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis. Bioinformatics analysis and further validation experiments revealed that RAP1 is a direct downstream target of miR-23a-3p, and overexpression of RAP1 reversed the profibrotic effect of miR-23a-3p. Taken together, these findings elucidated the role of eWAT in Ang II-induced myocardial fibrosis and indicated that adipocyte-derived exosomes mediate pathologic communication between dysfunctional adipose tissue and the heart by transporting miR-23a-3p into CFs, transforming fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and promoting excessive collagen deposition by targeting RAP1. Prevention of abnormal adipocyte exosome production, inhibition of miR-23a-3p biogenesis, and treatment with a miR-23a-3p antagonist are novel strategies for treating cardiac fibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "Millions of patients are suffering from ischemic stroke, it is urgent to figure out the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in order to find an effective cure. After I/R injury, pro-inflammatory cytokines especially interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) upregulates in ischemic brain cells, such as microglia and neuron. To ameliorate the inflammation after cerebral I/R injury, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD), leucine-rich repeat (LRR), and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is well-investigated. NLRP3 inflammasomes are complicated protein complexes that are activated by endogenous and exogenous danger signals to participate in the inflammatory response. The assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome lead to the caspase-1-dependent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Furthermore, pyroptosis is a pro-inflammatory cell death that occurs in a dependent manner on NLRP3 inflammasomes after cerebral I/R injury. In this review, we summarized the assembly and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome; moreover, we also concluded the pivotal role of NLRP3 inflammasome and inhibitors, targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in cerebral I/R injury.",

The perceived self-discrepancy has a significant impact on people's online behavior. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the research on self-discrepancy in the Internet era through a literature review. A total of 37 papers were included in this review. First, this study presents the basic characteristic of the reviewed articles (such as research contexts, samples, and data collection methods). Second, it summarized how the Internet affected people's self-discrepancy. Third, this review identified how self-discrepancy was associated with different kinds of online behavior (such as impression management, knowledge contribution, and gaming addiction). Finally, this study outlined several possible directions for future research.",

        "Abstract": "Background Microwave ablation (MWA) has attracted interest as a minimally invasive treatment for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). However, comparisons between MWA and surgical resection (SR) in the management of T1N0M0 PTC are rare. Purpose To compare the technical effectiveness, disease progression, and complications of MWA and SR for solitary T1N0M0 PTC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was conducted in a single center. A total of 1029 patients with T1N0M0 PTC treated with either MWA or SR from January 2015 to May 2021 were studied and divided into two groups according to treatment modality. Propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting were used to control for confounding factors. Disease progression was analyzed in T1N0M0 PTCs as well as T1a and T1b subgroups by using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results A total of 404 patients (mean age, 43 years \u00b1 12 [SD]; 289 women; 337 with T1a PTC) underwent MWA, and 625 (mean age, 46 years \u00b1 12; 495 women; 521 with T1a PTC) underwent SR. During the follow-up (median, 25 months; IQR, 7-61 months), there was no evidence of differences regarding disease progression in T1N0M0 (4.0% vs 4.0%; ",

        "Abstract": "Several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated abnormalities in static intra- and interhemispheric functional connectivity among diverse brain regions in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the dynamic changes in intra- and interhemispheric functional connectivity patterns in patients with MDD remain unclear. Fifty-eight first-episode, drug-naive patients with MDD and 48 age-, sex-, and education level-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state fMRI. Whole-brain functional connectivity, analyzed using the functional connectivity density (FCD) approach, was decomposed into ipsilateral and contralateral functional connectivity. We computed the intra- and interhemispheric dynamic FCD (dFCD) using a sliding window analysis to capture the dynamic patterns of functional connectivity. The temporal variability in functional connectivity was quantified as the variance of the dFCD over time. In addition, intra- and interhemispheric static FCD (sFCD) patterns were calculated. Associations between the dFCD variance and sFCD in abnormal brain regions and the severity of depressive symptoms were analyzed. Compared to HCs, patients with MDD showed lower interhemispheric dFCD variability in the inferior/middle frontal gyrus and decreased sFCD in the medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus in both intra- and interhemispheric comparisons. No significant correlations were found between any abnormal dFCD variance or sFCD at the intra- and interhemispheric levels and the severity of depressive symptoms. Our results suggest intra- and interhemispheric functional connectivity alterations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and default mode network regions involved in cognition, execution and emotion. Furthermore, our study emphasizes the essential role of altered interhemispheric communication dynamics in the DLPFC in patients with MDD. These findings contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD.",

        "Abstract": "Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke, ranked as the second leading cause of death worldwide. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is considered as a systematic method of assessing ischemic change on non-contrast CT scans (NCCT) of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients, while still suffering from the requirement of experts' experience and also the inconsistent results between readers. In this study, we proposed an automated ASPECTS method to utilize the powerful learning ability of neural networks for objectively scoring CT scans of AIS patients. First, we proposed to use the CT perfusion (CTP) from one-stop stroke imaging to provide the golden standard of ischemic regions for ASPECTS scoring. Second, we designed an asymmetry network to capture features when comparing the left and right sides for each ASPECTS region to estimate its ischemic status. Third, we performed experiments in a large main dataset of 870 patients, as well as an independent testing dataset consisting of 207 patients with radiologists' scorings. Experimental results show that our network achieved remarkable performance, as sensitivity and accuracy of 93.7 and 92.4% in the main dataset, and 95.5 and 91.3% in the independent testing dataset, respectively. In the latter dataset, our analysis revealed a high positive correlation between the ASPECTS score and the prognosis of patients in 90DmRs. Also, we found ASPECTS score is a good indicator of the size of CTP core volume of an infraction. The proposed method shows its potential for automated ASPECTS scoring on NCCT images.",

        "Abstract": "The use of Ge as framework atom to direct the formation of double-four-ring (d4r) unit is an effective way to prepare zeolite with extra-large pores, which however also brings about serious problems with regard to production cost and structure stability for their practical application. A new solvent-free thermal synthesis strategy is presented here for facile preparation and molecular-level mechanism study of extra-large-pore aluminophosphate zeotype DNL-1 with -CLO structure. For the first time, the formation of intermediate d4r in the induction period was successfully confirmed, and was correlated with the synthesis condition of low water content and quaternary ammonium template with suitable alkyl chain length. The self-assembly pathway via d4r to form lta, afterwards clo and super cages was further revealed. This work shed light on the rational synthesis of Ge-free extra-large-pore zeotypes based on d4r route.",

        "Abstract": "Leaf angle is an important trait in plants. Here, we demonstrate that the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase OsSLA1 plays an important role in leaf angle regulation in rice (Oryza sativa). OsSLA1 mutant plants exhibited a small leaf angle phenotype due to changes of adaxial cells in the lamina joint. GUS staining revealed that OsSLA1 was highly expressed in adaxial cells of the lamina joint. The OsSLA1 mutant plants were insensitive to exogenous epibrassinolide (eBL) and showed upregulated expression of DWARF and CPD, but downregulated expression of BU1, BUL1, and ILI1, indicating that brassinosteroid (BR) signal transduction was blocked. Fluorescence microscopy showed that OsSLA1 was localized to the plasma membrane and nearby periplasmic vesicles. Further study showed that OsSLA1 interacts with OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 via its intracellular domain and promotes the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1. In addition, phosphorylation experiments revealed that OsSLA1 does not possess kinase activity, but that it can be phosphorylated by OsBRI1 in\u2009vitro. Knockout of OsSLA1 in the context of d61 caused exacerbation of the mutant phenotype. These results demonstrate that OsSLA1 regulates leaf angle formation via positive regulation of BR signaling by enhancing the interaction of OsBRI1 with OsBAK1.",

        "Title": "Screening and Verification of Differentially Expressed Long Non-coding RNAs in the Peripheral Blood of Patients With asthma.",
        "Abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a key role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Although some differentially expressed lncRNAs have been identified in asthmatic patients, many asthma-related lncRNAs have not been annotated. In the present study, six patients and three healthy subjects were randomly selected from 34 asthmatic patients and 17 healthy subjects. Second-generation high-throughput sequencing was performed on their peripheral blood samples. There were 1,137 differentially expressed lncRNAs in the asthma patients compared to in the healthy controls, of which 485 were upregulated and 652 were downregulated. The top 30 enriched GO and KEGG terms were identified, and the cytosolic ribosome (GO:0022626) and ribosome (hsa03010) were associated with the most differentially expressed lncRNAs. The top 10 differentially expressed lncRNAs associated with asthma were verified by an lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network and RT-qPCR. Seven of the these (NONHSAT015495.2, MSTRG.71212.2, NONHSAT163272.1, NONHSAT181891.1, NONHSAT190964.1, ENST00000564809, and NONHSAT076890.2) were down-regulated in the peripheral blood of asthmatic patients, which was consistent with the sequencing results. Three patients and three healthy subjects were randomly selected from the remaining subjects to verify these seven lncRNAs by RT-qPCR, which further confirmed the sequencing results. Public database GSE106230 was also in agreement with the FPKM (Fragments Per kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads) trends of ENST00000564809, NONHSAT015495.2, NONHSAT181891.1, and NONHSAT190964.1. In conclusion, the present study identified seven lncRNAs that may serve as potential biological markers for asthma.",

        "Abstract": "Biomacromolecules are used to encapsulate carotenoids, but their poor absorption-enhancing ability restricts their application. This study integrated dietary fatty acids (FAs) into the protein-based encapsulation of fucoxanthin (FUCO) due to its positive role in carotenoid absorption. The results showed that of the 14 tested FAs, only myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and docosahexaenoic acid obviously promoted FUCO absorption. FAs were employed for FUCO encapsulation using bovine serum albumin (BSA) to fabricate FUCO-FA-BSA systems, with an encapsulation efficiency of\u00a0>\u00a098%, a particle size ranging from 113.1\u00a0nm to 193.5\u00a0nm, and a Zeta-potential between -32.8\u00a0mV and -38.3\u00a0mV. Electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed complete FUCO encapsulation, while the FUCO-loading particles exhibited a \"core-shell\" structure. The retention rate of the encapsulated FUCO increased 2.16-4.06 times when heated at 80.0\u00a0\u00b0C for 200\u00a0min. These results suggested that FA-BSA complexes might provide a promising strategy for embedding carotenoids.",

        "Title": "Role of Exosomes in Immune Microenvironment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.",
        "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer. Since most patients with HCC are diagnosed at the intermediate or advanced stage and because HCC has a high incidence of metastasis and recurrence, it is one of the leading causes of cancer death. Exosomes are a subtype of extracellular vesicles and are typically 30-150\u2009nm in diameter. Originating from endosomes, they can be secreted by almost all living cells. They are widely present in various body fluids and serve as an important medium for the interactions between cells. A series of studies have revealed that exosomes-mediated intercellular transfer of proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites plays a crucial role in the initiation and progression of HCC, hypoxia and angiogenesis, chemotherapy sensitivity, and cell death mode and regulates the immune microenvironment. In this paper, we reviewed the recent researches on the multiple roles of tumor-associated exosomes in the progression of HCC. We laid particular focus on those researches that reveal how exosomes regulate the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and how exosomal cargos affect the progression of HCC. Besides, we emphasize some prospective directions to achieve a more accurate and complete analysis of the HCC immune microenvironment.",

        "Abstract": "Differential gene expression analysis based on scRNA-seq data is challenging due to two unique characteristics of scRNA-seq data. First, multimodality and other heterogeneity of the gene expression among different cell conditions lead to divergences in the tail events or crossings of the expression distributions. Second, scRNA-seq data generally have a considerable fraction of dropout events, causing zero inflation in the expression. To account for the first characteristic, existing parametric approaches targeting the mean difference in gene expression are limited, while quantile regression that examines various locations in the distribution will improve the power. However, the second characteristic, zero inflation, makes the traditional quantile regression invalid and underpowered. We propose a quantile-based test that handles the two characteristics, multimodality and zero inflation, simultaneously. The proposed quantile rank-score based test for differential distribution detection (ZIQRank) is derived under a two-part quantile regression model for zero-inflated outcomes. It comprises a test in logistic modeling for the zero counts and a collection of rank-score tests adjusting for zero inflation at multiple prespecified quantiles of the positive part. The testing decision is based on an aggregate result by combining the marginal ",

We seek to explore the impacts of microbial DNA enrichment on inducing obesity-related adrenomedullary abnormalities and hypertension. Methods and Results Obesity was accompanied by remarkable bacterial DNA accumulation and elevated inflammation in the adrenal glands. Gut microbial DNA containing extracellular vesicles (mEVs) were readily leaked into the bloodstream and infiltrated into the adrenal glands in obese mice, causing microbial DNA enrichment. In lean wild-type mice, adrenal macrophages expressed CRIg (complement receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily) that efficiently blocks the infiltration of gut mEVs. In contrast, the adrenal CRIg+ cell population was greatly decreased in obese mice. In lean CRIg",

        "Abstract": "Fatty liver disease (FLD) is a growing health issue with burdening unmet clinical needs. FLD has a genetic component but, despite the common variants already identified, there is still a missing heritability component. Using a candidate gene approach, we identify a locus (rs71519934) at the Pleckstrin and Sec7 domain-containing 3 (PSD3) gene resulting in a leucine to threonine substitution at position 186 of the protein (L186T) that reduces susceptibility to the entire spectrum of FLD in individuals at risk. PSD3 downregulation by short interfering RNA reduces intracellular lipid content in primary human hepatocytes cultured in two and three dimensions, and in human and rodent hepatoma cells. Consistent with this, Psd3 downregulation by antisense oligonucleotides in vivo protects against FLD in mice fed a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-inducing diet. Thus, translating these results to humans, PSD3 downregulation might be a future therapeutic option for treating FLD.",

        "Abstract": "Various microbial products leaked from gut lumen exacerbate tissue inflammation and metabolic disorders in obesity. Vsig4+ macrophages are key players preventing infiltration of bacteria and their products into host tissues. However, roles of islet Vsig4+ macrophages in the communication between microbiota and \u03b2 cells in pathogenesis of obesity-associated islet abnormalities are unknown. Here, we find that bacterial DNAs are enriched in \u03b2 cells of individuals with obesity. Intestinal microbial DNA-containing extracellular vesicles (mEVs) readily pass through obese gut barrier and deliver microbial DNAs into \u03b2 cells, resulting in elevated inflammation and impaired insulin secretion by triggering cGAS/STING activation. Vsig4+ macrophages prevent mEV infiltration into \u03b2 cells through a C3-dependent opsonization, whereas loss of Vsig4 leads to microbial DNA enrichment in \u03b2 cells after mEV treatment. Removal of microbial DNAs blunts mEV effects. Loss of Vsig4+ macrophages leads to microbial DNA accumulation in \u03b2 cells and subsequently obesity-associated islet abnormalities.",

        "Abstract": "Fucoxanthin, a special xanthophyll derived from marine algae, has increasingly attracted attention due to its diverse biological functions. However, reports on its ocular benefits are still limited. In this work, the ameliorative effect of fucoxanthin on visible light and lipid peroxidation-induced phagocytosis disruption in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells was investigated in vitro. Marked oxidative stress, inflammation, and phagocytosis disruption were evident in differentiated RPE cells following their exposure to visible light under a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-rich environment. Following pretreatment with fucoxanthin, however, the activated nuclear factor erythroid-derived-2-like 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway was observed and, furthermore, when the fucoxanthin -pretreated RPE cells were irradiated with visible light, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and inflammation were obviously suppressed, while phagocytosis was significantly improved. However, following the addition of Nrf2 inhibitor ML385, the fucoxanthin exhibited no ameliorative effects on the oxidative stress, inflammation, and phagocytosis disruption in the RPE cells, thus indicating that the ameliorative effect of fucoxanthin on the phagocytosis of RPE cells is closely related to the Nrf2 signaling pathway. In conclusion, these results suggest that fucoxanthin supplementation might be beneficial to the prevention of visible light-induced retinal injury.",

        "Abstract": "Cervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM) is common in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), which is responsible for tumor staging and surgical strategy. The accurate preoperative identification of CLNM is essential. In this study, twenty consecutive patients with PTC received a parenchyma injection of Sonazoid followed by contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to identify CLNM. The specific lymphatic CEUS (LCEUS) signs for diagnosing CLNM were summarized, which were further compared with the resected specimens to get the pathological basis. After the injection of contrast agent, lymphatic vessel and lymph node (LN) could be exclusively displayed as hyperperfusion on LCEUS. The dynamic perfusion process of contrast agent in CLNM over time can be clearly visualized. Perfusion defect and interruption of bright ring were the two characteristic LCEUS signs in diagnosing CLNM. After comparing with pathology, perfusion defect was correlated to the metastatic foci in medulla and interruption of bright ring was correlated to the tumor seeding in marginal sinus (all p values\u2009<\u20090.001). The diagnostic efficacies of these two signs were high (perfusion defect vs. interruption of bright ring: AUC, 0.899, 95% CI 0.752-1.000 vs. 0.904, 0.803-1.000). LCEUS has advantages in identifying CLNM from PTC. The typical LCEUS signs of CLNM correlated with pathology.",

        "Abstract": "Total intracranial volume (TICV) and posterior fossa volume (PFV) are essential covariates for brain volumetric analyses with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Detailed whole brain segmentation provides a non-invasive way to measure brain regions. Furthermore, increasing neuroimaging data are distributed in a skull-stripped manner for privacy protection. Therefore, generalizing deep learning brain segmentation for skull removal and intracranial measurements is an appealing task. However, data availability is challenging due to a limited set of manually traced atlases with whole brain and TICV/PFV labels. In this paper, we employ U-Net tiles to achieve automatic TICV estimation and whole brain segmentation simultaneously on brains w/and w/o the skull. To overcome the scarcity of manually traced whole brain volumes, a transfer learning method is introduced to estimate additional TICV and PFV labels during whole brain segmentation in T1-weighted MRI. Specifically, U-Net tiles are first pre-trained using large-scale BrainCOLOR atlases without TICV and PFV labels, which are created by multi-atlas segmentation. Then the pre-trained models are refined by training the additional TICV and PFV labels using limited BrainCOLOR atlases. We also extend our method to handle skull-stripped brain MR images. From the results, our method provides promising whole brain segmentation and volume estimation results for both brains w/and w/o skull in terms of mean Dice similarity coefficients and mean surface distance and absolute volume similarity. This method has been made available in open source (https://github.com/MASILab/SLANTbrainSeg_skullstripped).",

        "Abstract": "Neurological deficits after stroke are closely related to white matter microstructure damage. However, secondary changes in white matter microstructure after pontine infarction (PI) in the whole brain remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the correlation of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI)-derived diffusion and kurtosis parameters of abnormal white matter tracts with behavioral function in patients with chronic PI. Overall, 60 patients with unilateral chronic PI (33 patients with left PI and 27 patients with right PI) and 30 normal subjects were recruited and underwent DKI scans. Diffusion parameters derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and DKI and kurtosis parameters derived from DKI were obtained. Between-group differences in multiple parameters were analyzed to assess the changes in abnormal white matter microstructure. Moreover, we also calculated the sensitivities of different diffusion and kurtosis parameters of DTI and DKI for identifying abnormal white matter tracts. Correlations between the DKI-derived parameters in secondary microstructure changes and behavioral scores in the PI were analyzed. Compared with the NC group, both left PI and right PI groups showed more extensive perilesional and remote white matter microstructure changes. The DKI-derived diffusion parameters showed higher sensitivities than did the DTI-derived parameters. Further, DKI-derived diffusion and kurtosis parameters in abnormal white matter regions were correlated with impaired motor and cognitive function in patients with PI. In conclusion, PI could lead to extensive white matter tracts impairment in perilesional and remote regions. Further, the diffusion and kurtosis parameters could be complementary for identifying comprehensive tissue microstructural damage after PI.",

Little is known about the contribution of HIV interventions, such as antiretroviral therapy (ART) and male medical circumcision, to more recent trends in orphanhood. In this study, we examined trends over time in maternal-only, paternal-only, and double orphanhood among adolescents before and after ART and male medical circumcision became widely available in the Rakai region of south-central Uganda. We sought to understand the association between adolescent orphanhood and HIV combination prevention (community-level ART use and prevalence of male medical circumcision). We hypothesised that increasing combination prevention, including greater use of ART and higher prevalence of male medical circumcision, would be associated with a lower probability of orphanhood.",

        "Abstract": "The inflammatory response of macrophages is an orderly and complex process under strict regulation accompanied by drastic changes in morphology and functions. It is predicted that proteins will undergo structural changes during these finely regulated processes. However, changes in structural proteome in macrophages during the inflammatory response remain poorly characterized. In the present study, we applied limited proteolysis coupled mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) to identify proteome-wide structural changes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages. We identified 386 structure-specific proteolytic fingerprints from 230 proteins. Using the Gene Ontology (GO) biological process enrichment, we discovered that proteins with altered structures were enriched into protein folding-related terms, in which HSP60 was ranked as the most changed protein. We verified the structural changes in HSP60 by using cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and native CETSA. Our results showed that the thermal stability of HSP60 was enhanced in activated macrophages and formed an HSP10-less complex. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in situ structural systems biology is an effective method to characterize proteomic structural changes and reveal that the structures of chaperone proteins vary significantly during macrophage activation.",

Organic nanogrids are an expanding family of macrocycle-like closed structures at the nanoscale, but with a series of well-defined extension edges and vertices. Cyclic nanogrids can be used as nanoscale building blocks for the fabrication of not only rotaxanes, catenanes, knots, 3D cages, but also nanopolymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and complex molecular cross-scale architectures. In this review, the history of fluorene-based macrocycles has first been explored, followed by the development of the synthetic methodologies; in particular, fluorene-based nanogrids are highlighted owing to their features and applications. Typically, fluorenes are fused arenes with a hybrid entity between tetrahedral Csp",

        "Abstract": "Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process has been acknowledged as an environmentally friendly and time-saving technique capable of achieving efficient nitrogen removal. However, the community of nitrification process in anammox-inoculated wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has not been elucidated. In this study, ammonia oxidation (AO) and nitrite oxidation (NO) rates were analyzed with the incubation of activated sludge from Xinfeng WWTPs (Taiwan, China), and the community composition of nitrification communities were investigated by high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that both AO and NO had strong activity in the activated sludge. The average rates of AO and NO in sample A were 6.51\u00a0\u00b5mol L",

        "Title": "Environmental allergens house dust mite-induced asthma is associated with ferroptosis in the lungs.",
        "Abstract": "Previous studies have indicated that allergens such as house dust mites (HDM) in the environment can induce allergic asthma. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of regulatory cell death characterized by aberrant lipid peroxidation and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells. However, whether ferroptosis participates in the pathological process of asthma remains to be elucidated. The present study used a HDM-induced mouse asthma model to determine the effect of HDM exposure on allergic asthma and its underlying mechanisms. Female BALB/c mice were intranasally exposed to HDM to induce allergic asthma. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), lung inflammation, mucus secretion, IgE levels, cytokine levels and inflammatory cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were investigated. In addition, the morphological changes of mitochondria, ROS levels, glutathione (GSH) levels and changes in ferroptosis pathway proteins were also determined in murine lungs. As a result, HDM exposure significantly increased AHR, inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus secretion around the airways. Furthermore, elevated IgE levels in the BALF, lung eosinophilia and a concomitant increase in IL-13 and IL-5 levels in BALF were observed. HDM inhalation increased ROS and decreased GSH levels in the lungs. HDM inhalation induced dysmorphic small mitochondria with decreased crista, as well as condensed, ruptured outer membranes. Western blotting demonstrated that the activities of glutathione peroxidase 4 and catalytic subunit solute carrier family 7 member 11 were significantly decreased, and that protein expression levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 and 15 lipoxygenase 1 were upregulated compared with mice in the normal control group. Overall, these results indicated that the AHR, airway inflammation, lipid peroxidation and ROS levels increased in HDM-induced asthma, and that HDM inhalation induced ferroptosis in the lungs, which helped to form an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of allergic asthma.",

        "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Accurately diagnosing the malignancy of suspected lung nodules is of paramount clinical importance. However, to date, the pathologically-proven lung nodule dataset is largely limited and is highly imbalanced in benign and malignant distributions. In this study, we proposed a Semi-supervised Deep Transfer Learning (SDTL) framework for benign-malignant pulmonary nodule diagnosis. First, we utilize a transfer learning strategy by adopting a pre-trained classification network that is used to differentiate pulmonary nodules from nodule-like tissues. Second, since the size of samples with pathological-proven is small, an iterated feature-matching-based semi-supervised method is proposed to take advantage of a large available dataset with no pathological results. Specifically, a similarity metric function is adopted in the network semantic representation space for gradually including a small subset of samples with no pathological results to iteratively optimize the classification network. In this study, a total of 3,038 pulmonary nodules (from 2,853 subjects) with pathologically-proven benign or malignant labels and 14,735 unlabeled nodules (from 4,391 subjects) were retrospectively collected. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SDTL framework achieves superior diagnosis performance, with accuracy = 88.3%, AUC = 91.0% in the main dataset, and accuracy = 74.5%, AUC = 79.5% in the independent testing dataset. Furthermore, ablation study shows that the use of transfer learning provides 2% accuracy improvement, and the use of semi-supervised learning further contributes 2.9% accuracy improvement. Results implicate that our proposed classification network could provide an effective diagnostic tool for suspected lung nodules, and might have a promising application in clinical practice.",

        "Title": "Intervention of WeChat Group Guidance in Rapid Rehabilitation after Gynecological Laparoscopic Surgery.",
        "Abstract": "Gynecological laparoscopic surgery is the current routine treatment. Although the injury is relatively small, it is still a traumatic operation and also increases the recovery speed of patients. This paper mainly explores the intervention effect of rapid rehabilitation after gynecological laparoscopic surgery by means of WeChat group guidance based on the information adoption model and UTAUT model. Gynecological patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery and met the inclusion and exclusion conditions in a provincial maternal and child health hospital were selected as the research objects. The WeChat intervention group was compared with the nonintervention group, and the oral description score (VRS), comfort score (BCS), and 40-item recovery quality rating scale (QoR-40) were used as the scoring criteria. The results showed that the postoperative VRS and BCS scores in the WeChat intervention group were significantly lower than those in the nonintervention group. The total score of QoR-40 in both groups decreased compared with that before operation, reached the lowest on the first day after operation, and began to rise from the second day. This result is consistent with the patient's postoperative recovery process. After operation, the total score of the WeChat intervention group on days 1 and 2 was higher than that of the non-WeChat intervention group. By comparing the results of the patient's postoperative oral description score (VRS), comfort score (BCS), 40-item recovery quality score scale (QoR-40), etc., it can be shown that the overall recovery quality of the WeChat intervention group was better during these two days. In each section, the oral description score (VRS) and the 40-item recovery quality score scale (QoR-40) indicated that the pain sensation and emotional state scores of patients in the WeChat intervention group were higher than those in the nonintervention group, while the comfort score (BCS) was lower, indicating better comfort in the WeChat intervention group.",

        "Abstract": "Enabled by active motion of microrobots, conventional biological detection and chemical analyses limited by passive diffusion can be significantly enhanced with fast testing speed and unique sensitiveness. However, controlled release and precise enrichment of microrobot swarms are still difficult to accomplish and thus prohibit them away from practical applications. Here, an efficient and versatile strategy utilizing a needle-shaped hybrid sonoelectrode to disperse and aggregate distinct micromotors is presented, remarkably accelerating mass transfer and enhancing the signal intensity. Hydrogen bubbles generated at the tip of charged electrode can oscillate as actuated by the acoustic field, creating intensified vortexes to disperse micromotors spontaneously. Via removing the attached bubble, the sonoelectrode serving as solid needle isolator is capable of collecting micromotors in a large scale with acoustic streaming in the working reservoir at higher ultrasound frequency. Numerical calculation reveals the streaming profiles with/without microbubbles, and manipulations on classic spherical and tubular micromotor models confirm that the acoustic-powered prototype device is effective for controlling different swarming behaviors in microfluidic channels. Overall, the proposed hybrid sonoelectrode offers a universal and rapid strategy to tailor micromotor swarm behaviors, advancing intelligent microrobots to be featured with active enrichment and compatible for next-generation sensitive portable detection microsystems.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity induces an adaptive expansion of \u03b2 cell mass and insulin secretion abnormality. Expansion of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) is a hallmark of obesity. Here, we assessed a novel role of ATMs in mediating obesity-induced \u03b2 cell adaptation through the release of miRNA-containing extracellular vesicles (EVs). In both in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that ATM EVs derived from obese mice notably suppress insulin secretion and enhance \u03b2 cell proliferation. We also observed similar phenotypes from human islets after obese ATM EV treatment. Importantly, depletion of miRNAs blunts the effects of obese ATM EVs, as evidenced by minimal effects of obese DicerKO ATM EVs on \u03b2 cell responses. miR-155 is a highly enriched miRNA within obese ATM EVs and miR-155 overexpressed in \u03b2 cells impairs insulin secretion and enhances \u03b2 cell proliferation. In contrast, knockout of miR-155 attenuates the regulation of obese ATM EVs on \u03b2 cell responses. We further demonstrate that the miR-155-",

        "Abstract": "As lifestyle and diet structure impact our health, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is prevalent all over the world. Some phytomedicines containing berberine (BBR) have been extensively used for centuries in Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine. The goal of this systematic review is to investigate the preclinical evidence of BBR on NAFLD models. The following relevant databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase, were retrieved from inception to May 2021. The content involved BBR on different animal models for the treatment of NAFLD. The SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) Animal Experiment Bias Risk Assessment Tool was used to assess the methodological quality and RevMan 5.4 software was used to conduct the meta-analysis based on the Cochrane tool. A total of 31 studies involving 566 animals were included, of which five models and five animal breeds were reported. The results showed that TC, TG, ALT, AST, HDL-C, LDL-C, FBG, FINS, and FFA in the group treated with BBR were significantly restored compared with those in the model group. HOMA-IR had a significant downward trend, but the result was not significantly different (P = 0.08). The subgroup analysis of the different models and different animal breeds indicated that BBR could ameliorate the aforementioned indicator levels, although some results showed no significant difference. Finally, we summarized the molecular mechanisms by which berberine regulated NAFLD/NASH, mainly focusing on activating the AMPK pathway, improving insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, regulating mitochondrial function, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, regulating cell death and ER stress, reducing DNA methylation, and regulating intestinal microenvironment and neurotoxicity. The preclinical evidence suggested that BBR might be an effective and promising drug for treating NAFLD/NASH. In addition, further studies with more well-designed researches are needed to confirm this conclusion.",

Herein, a chiral difluorenol, 2,2'-(9,9'-spirobi[fluorene]-2,2'-diyl)bis(9-(4-(octyloxy)phenyl)-9H-fluoren-9-ol) (DOHSBF), is set as a desirable model to reveal the stereoisomeric effects of wide-bandgap molecules toward controlling photophysical behavior and improving thermal and optical stability. Three diastereomers are obtained and elucidated by NMR spectra. Interestingly, the effect of modifying the stereo-centers is not observed on optical properties in solutions, pristine films, or post-treated film states. All three diastereomers as well as the mixture exhibit excellent spectral stability without undesirable green emission. Therefore, this stereoisomer-independent blue-emitting difluorenol will be a promising candidate for next-generation wide-bandgap semiconductors that would have extensive application in organic photonics.",

        "Abstract": "In pre- and post-surgical surface shape analysis, establishing shape correspondence is necessary to investigate the postoperative surface changes. However, structural absence after the operation accompanies focal non-rigid changes, which leads to challenges in existing surface registration methods. In this paper, we present a fully automatic particle-based method to establish surface correspondence that can handle partial structural abnormality in the temporal lobe resection. Our method optimizes the coordinates of points which are modeled as particles on surfaces in a hierarchical way to reduce a chance of being trapped in a local minimum during the optimization. In the experiments, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method in comparison with conventional spherical registration (FreeSurfer) on two scenarios: cortical thickness changes in healthy controls within a short scan-rescan time window and patients with temporal lobe resection. The post-surgical scan is acquired at least 1 year after the presurgical scan. In region of interest-wise (ROI-wise) analysis, no changes on cortical thickness are found in both methods on the healthy control group. In patients, since there is no ground truth available, we instead investigated the disagreement between our method and FreeSurfer. We see poorly matched ROIs and large cortical thickness changes using FreeSurfer. On the contrary, our method shows well-matched ROIs and subtle cortical thickness changes. This suggests that the proposed method can establish a stable shape correspondence, which is not fully captured in a conventional spherical registration.",

        "Abstract": "Exosomes are nanoparticles secreted by all cell types and are a large component of the broader class of nanoparticles termed extracellular vesicles (EVs). Once secreted, exosomes gain access to the interstitial space and ultimately the circulation, where they exert local paracrine or distal systemic effects. Because of this, exosomes are important components of an intercellular and intraorgan communication system capable of carrying biologic signals from one cell type or tissue to another. The exosomal cargo consists of proteins, lipids, miRNAs, and other RNA species, and many of the biologic effects of exosomes have been attributed to miRNAs. Exosomal miRNAs have also been used as disease biomarkers. The field of exosome biology and metabolism is rapidly expanding, with new discoveries and reports appearing on a regular basis, and it is possible that potential therapeutic approaches for the use of exosomes or miRNAs in metabolic diseases will be initiated in the near future.",

        "Abstract": "In chronic obesity, hepatocytes become insulin resistant and exert important effects on systemic metabolism. Here we show that in early onset obesity (4\u2009weeks high-fat diet), hepatocytes secrete exosomes that enhance insulin sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. These beneficial effects were due to exosomal microRNA miR-3075, which is enriched in these hepatocyte exosomes. FA2H is a direct target of miR-3075 and small interfering RNA depletion of FA2H in adipocytes, myocytes and primary hepatocytes leads to increased insulin sensitivity. In chronic obesity (16-18\u2009weeks of a high-fat diet), hepatocyte exosomes promote a state of insulin resistance. These chronic obese hepatocyte exosomes do not directly cause impaired insulin signalling in vitro but do promote proinflammatory activation of macrophages. Taken together, these studies show that in early onset obesity, hepatocytes produce exosomes that express high levels of the insulin-sensitizing miR-3075. In chronic obesity, this compensatory effect is lost and hepatocyte-derived exosomes from chronic obese mice promote insulin resistance.",

        "Title": "Development of a Chinese College Students' Attitudes Toward Sexual Swear Words Scale.",
        "Abstract": "Sexual swear words are frequently used and considered vulgar and controversial in Chinese. The study of attitude is not only an important part of the study of swear words, but is also an important way for predicting their use. To date, few independent studies have been conducted on Chinese sexual swear words; those that have been conducted mostly focus on language ontology rather than language use. The studies have mainly used qualitative research methods, with a lack of empirical analysis and use of measurement tools. It is feasible and necessary to study college students as the object of sexual swear words because of the prevalence of \"Zu'an culture\" and the abuse of sexual swear words. Based on the current research status of Chinese swear words and the context of using swear words on campus, this paper combines the research of linguistic differences in swearing, psychological theories, and social science measurement theories and uses SPSS and Mplus statistical software to develop Chinese college students' attitudes toward Sexual Swear Words Scale. The participants consist of students from Zhejiang Normal University and other universities. A total of 262 college students participated in the preliminary test. Through item analysis and exploratory factor analysis, the formal scale was formed. A total of 608 college students were formally tested, and confirmatory factor analysis, reliability, and validity tests were carried out to produce the final scale. The scale contains three subscales: Cognition (17 items), Affection (17 items), and Behavior Tendency (15 items). The results show that each subscale model fits well, has good reliability and validity, and can be used as an important tool to measure attitudes of Chinese college students toward sexual swear words.",

        "Title": "VvANR silencing promotes expression of VvANS and accumulation of anthocyanin in grape berries.",
        "Abstract": "Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) technology was applied to silence VvANR in cv. Zaoheibao grape berries, and the effects of VvANR silencing on berries phenotype; gene expression level of ANS, LAR1, LAR2, and UFGT; enzyme activity of ANS; and accumulations of anthocyanin and flavan-3-ol were investigated. At the third day after treatment, the VvANR silenced grape berries began to turn red slightly, which was 2\u00a0days earlier than that of the control group. And the flavan-3-ol content in VvANR-silenced grape berries had been remarkable within 1 to 5\u00a0days, the ANR enzyme activity in VvANR-silenced grapes extremely significantly decreased in 3\u00a0days, and LAR enzyme activity also decreased, but the difference was not striking. The ANS enzyme activity of the transformed berries was significantly higher than that of the control after 3\u00a0days of infection, and it was exceedingly significantly higher than that of the control after 5 to 10\u00a0days. The content of anthocyanin in transformed berries increased of a very marked difference within 3 to 15\u00a0days. pTRV2-ANR infection resulted in an extremely significant decrease in the expression of VvANR gene, and the expression of VvLAR1, VvLAR2, VvMYBPA1, VvMYBPA2, and VvDFR were also down-regulated. However, the expression of VvANS and VvUFGT was up-regulated significantly. After VvANR silencing via VIGS, VvANR expression in grape berries was extremely significantly decreased, resulting in decreased ANR enzyme activity and flavan-3-ol content; berries turned red and deeper in advance. In addition, VvANR silencing can induce up-regulation of VvANS and VvUFGT expression, significantly increase ANS enzyme activity, and increase of anthocyanin accumulation.",

        "Abstract": "Chloroplast biogenesis requires the coordinated expression of chloroplast and nuclear genes. Here, we show that EMB1270, a plastid-localized pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, is required for chloroplast biogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Knockout of EMB1270 led to embryo arrest, whereas a mild knockdown mutant of EMB1270 displayed a virescent phenotype. Almost no photosynthetic proteins accumulated in the albino emb1270 knockout mutant. By contrast, in the emb1270 knockdown mutant, the levels of ClpP1 and photosystem I (PSI) subunits were significantly reduced, whereas the levels of photosystem II (PSII) subunits were normal. Furthermore, the splicing efficiencies of the clpP1.2, ycf3.1, ndhA, and ndhB plastid introns were dramatically reduced in both emb1270 mutants. RNA immunoprecipitation revealed that EMB1270 associated with these introns in vivo. In an RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (REMSA), a truncated EMB1270 protein containing the 11 N-terminal PPR motifs bound to the predicted sequences of the clpP1.2, ycf3.1, and ndhA introns. In addition, EMB1270 specifically interacted with CRM Family Member 2 (CFM2). Given that CFM2 is known to be required for splicing the same plastid RNAs, our results suggest that EMB1270 associates with CFM2 to facilitate the splicing of specific group II introns in Arabidopsis.",

        "Abstract": "Early and accurate severity assessment of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on computed tomography (CT) images offers a great help to the estimation of intensive care unit event and the clinical decision of treatment planning. To augment the labeled data and improve the generalization ability of the classification model, it is necessary to aggregate data from multiple sites. This task faces several challenges including class imbalance between mild and severe infections, domain distribution discrepancy between sites, and presence of heterogeneous features. In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation (DA) method with two components to address these problems. The first component is a stochastic class-balanced boosting sampling strategy that overcomes the imbalanced learning problem and improves the classification performance on poorly-predicted classes. The second component is a representation learning that guarantees three properties: 1) domain-transferability by prototype triplet loss, 2) discriminant by conditional maximum mean discrepancy loss, and 3) completeness by multi-view reconstruction loss. Particularly, we propose a domain translator and align the heterogeneous data to the estimated class prototypes (i.e., class centers) in a hyper-sphere manifold. Experiments on cross-site severity assessment of COVID-19 from CT images show that the proposed method can effectively tackle the imbalanced learning problem and outperform recent DA approaches.",

At 4 months after hospitalisation, fibrotic-like patterns were more common in those who underwent mechanical ventilation (72%) than in those who did not (20%). We demonstrate that severity of initial illness, duration of mechanical ventilation, lactate dehydrogenase on admission and leucocyte telomere length are independent risk factors for fibrotic-like radiographic abnormalities. These fibrotic-like changes correlate with lung function, cough and measures of frailty, but not with dyspnoea.",

However, the ablation outcomes of T1N0M0 PTC are not well characterized. Purpose To evaluate the efficacy and safety of thermal ablation (MWA or RFA) of solitary T1N0M0 PTC in patients who were ineligible for (due to presence of comorbid cardiovascular disease, renal failure, other malignancy, etc) or who refused surgery. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective multicenter study of 847 patients (660 women) who underwent thermal ablation for PTC (673 T1a, 174 T1b) between March 2015 and March 2020; of these patients, 645 underwent MWA and 202 underwent RFA. The mean age of patients was 46 years \u00b1 11 (standard deviation) (age range, 18-81 years); the mean follow-up time was 22 months \u00b1 13 (range, 6-60 months). Changes in tumor size and volume and the rates of technical success, tumor disappearance, disease progression, and complications were assessed. Results The technical success rate was 100%. Relative to preablation measurements, the maximum diameter and volume of the ablation zone increased during the 1st month after ablation (",

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer risk models increasingly are including mammographic density (MD) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) to improve identification of higher-risk women who may benefit from genetic screening, earlier and supplemental breast screening, chemoprevention, and other targeted interventions. Here, we present additional considerations for improved clinical use of risk prediction models with MD, PRS, and questionnaire-based risk factors. These considerations include whether changing risk factor patterns, including MD, can improve risk prediction and management, and whether PRS could help inform breast cancer screening without MD measures and prior to the age at initiation of population-based mammography. We further argue that it may be time to reconsider issues around breast cancer risk models that may warrant a more comprehensive head-to-head comparison with other methods for risk factor assessment and risk prediction, including emerging artificial intelligence methods. With the increasing recognition of limitations of any single mathematical model, no matter how simplified, we are at an important juncture for consideration of these different approaches for improved risk stratification in geographically and ethnically diverse populations.",

        "Abstract": "Periodontitis is a chronic inflammation of the soft tissue surrounding and supporting the teeth, which causes periodontal structural damage, alveolar bone resorption, and even tooth loss. Its prevalence is very high, with nearly 60% of the global population affected. Hence, periodontitis is an important public health concern, and the development of effective healing treatments for oral diseases is a major target of the health sciences. Currently, the application of local drug delivery systems (LDDS) as an adjunctive therapy to scaling and root planning (SRP) in periodontitis is a promising strategy, giving higher efficacy and fewer side effects by controlling drug release. The cornerstone of successful periodontitis therapy is to select an appropriate bioactive agent and route of administration. In this context, this review highlights applications of LDDS with different properties in the treatment of periodontitis with or without systemic diseases, in order to reveal existing challenges and future research directions.",

        "Abstract": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) causes substantial economic losses to the global pig industry. Members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family are the important effectors of the innate immune response against viral infections. We have previously characterized the entire porcine TRIM (pTRIM) family, and predicted pTRIM5, 14, 21, 25 and 38 as host restriction factors against PRRSV infection. However, little is known about whether and how pTRIMs restrict the infection of PRRSV. In this study, we firstly performed the amino acid alignments of the RING domain of pTRIM5, 21, 25 and 38, and found that pTRIM proteins contained the characteristic consensus C3HC4 type zinc-binding motif which is important for the ubiquitination function. Then we detected the mRNA changes of pTRIMs in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) by transcriptome sequencing after PRRSV infection in piglets. Transcriptional profiles showed that the expression of pTRIM5, 21 and 26 was significantly (P < 0.05) up-regulated, consistent with their expression in vitro. Finally, as the most up-regulated gene after PRRSV infection both in vivo and in vitro, pTRIM21 was investigated for its anti-PRRSV activity in immortalized PAMs (iPAMs) in two aspects: knockdown and overexpression of pTRIM21. Knockdown of endogenic pTRIM21 could significantly promote PRRSV replication at 12 and 24 h post infection in iPAMs. Meanwhile, overexpression of pTRIM21 could significantly suppress PRRSV replication but not affect its attachment and endocytosis. Moreover, pTRIM21 RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase was essential for anti-PRRSV activity. Our data enhance our understanding of the pTRIMs against PRRSV infection, which may help us develop novel therapeutic tools to control PRRSV.",

        "Abstract": "Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a conserved transcriptional coactivator that plays key roles in controlling organ size, tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Emerging evidence shows that YAP is overexpressed and associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitor treatment in melanoma. However, the mechanism accounting for YAP-overexpression in melanoma is largely unknown. The present study characterized ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22) as a deubiquitinase controlling YAP abundance and biological functions in melanoma. Using western blotting and immunohistochemical staining, it was found that the expression of USP22 and YAP was associated in melanoma cell lines and patient samples. Moreover, USP22 interacted with and deubiquitinated YAP to prevent YAP turnover. Depletion of USP22 decreased YAP expression, which in turn suppressed cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, overexpression of USP22 conferred vemurafenib resistance in a YAP-dependent manner. Overall, the present study revealed the important role of the USP22/YAP axis in melanoma and BRAF inhibitor resistance, and provides a rationale to target USP22/YAP for melanoma treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Stroke is a major cause of vascular cognitive dysfunction, such as memory impairment. We aimed to explore the neural substrates underlying verbal memory impairment in subcortical stroke patients by the methods of voxel-wise cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the functional covariance network (FCN). Sixty patients with chronic subcortical stroke and 60 normal controls (NCs) were recruited into this study. We used a three-dimensional pseudo-continuous arterial spin-labeling imaging to measure alterations in CBF and FCNs. We mapped the overall CBF alterations in a voxel-wise manner and compared CBF measurements using a two-sample t test. Correlations between CBF and verbal memory were also investigated. Subsequently, we constructed FCNs by calculating the correlation between specific regions and all other voxels of a whole brain, separately within the two groups. Thereafter, by comparing differences of the FCN patterns between the patient and NC groups, we investigated the connection alterations within the FCN maps. The stroke patients showed verbal short-term memory (VSTM) deficits compared to NCs. The patients exhibited decreased CBF in the ipsilesional insula and ventral sensorimotor network, and increased CBF in contralesional frontal cortical and subcortical regions (putamen and thalamus). Meanwhile, the CBF in the ipsilesional insula was positively correlated, and the contralesional frontal cortical was negativity correlated, with VSTM scores. Moreover we found that stroke patients exhibited disordered connection within FCNs compared to NCs. The study suggests that the underlying imaging biomarker of VSTM impairment in patients with subcortical stroke was associated with disconnection of the frontal lobe network.",

        "Abstract": "This study was aimed to explore the mechanism of rutaecarpine (RUT) on ethanol-induced gastric ulcer (GU) in mice by integrated approaches. At first, the efficacy was determined through the macroscopic and microscopic state of stomach tissue and the expression levels of GU-related factors. Then, the serum metabolomics method based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was used to explore the specific metabolites and metabolic pathways. Finally, the upstream key protein targets of these specific metabolites were analyzed by network pharmacology and verified by PCR to explore the potential mechanism. RUT alleviated the histological and pathological damage of gastric tissue caused by ethanol, and could remarkably ameliorate the level of GU-related factors. Subsequently, a total of 7 potential metabolites involved in 9 metabolic pathways were identified by metabolomics analysis. Then, a 'component-targets-metabolites' interaction network was constructed, and therefore 4 key target proteins (PLA2G1B, PDE5A, MIF and SRC) that may regulate the specific metabolites were obtained. This case was further verified by the results of PCR. ALL the above results strongly demonstrated that RUT exerted a gastroprotective effect against GU. And it is the first time to combine metabolomics combined with network pharmacology to elucidate the mechanism of RUT on GU, which may be related to the regulation of energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation, and these pathways may be regulated through the upstream protein PLA2G1B, PDE5A, MIF and SRC.",

        "Abstract": "The worldwide spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a threat to global public health. It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately screen and distinguish patients with COVID-19 from those with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In this study, a total of 1,658 patients with COVID-19 and 1,027 CAP patients underwent thin-section CT and were enrolled. All images were preprocessed to obtain the segmentations of infections and lung fields. A set of handcrafted location-specific features was proposed to best capture the COVID-19 distribution pattern, in comparison to the conventional CT severity score (CT-SS) and radiomics features. An infection size-aware random forest method (iSARF) was proposed for discriminating COVID-19 from CAP. Experimental results show that the proposed method yielded its best performance when using the handcrafted features, with a sensitivity of 90.7%, a specificity of 87.2%, and an accuracy of 89.4% over state-of-the-art classifiers. Additional tests on 734 subjects, with thick slice images, demonstrates great generalizability. It is anticipated that our proposed framework could assist clinical decision making.",

In this study, we aimed to use voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) to investigate changes in the cognitive function in chronic pontine stroke. Functional MRI (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of cognitive function were obtained from 56 patients with chronic pontine ischemic stroke [28 patients with left-sided pontine stroke (LP) and 28 patients with right-sided pontine stroke (RP)] and 35 matched healthy controls (HC). The one-way ANOVA test was performed for the three groups after the VMHC analysis. Results showed that there were significant decreases in the bilateral lingual gyrus (Lingual_L and Lingual_R) and the left precuneus (Precuneus_L) in patients with chronic pontine ischemic stroke compared to HCs.

        "Title": "Luteolin inhibits autophagy in allergic asthma by activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and inhibiting Beclin-1-PI3KC3 complex.",
        "Abstract": "Allergic asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disease characterized by airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion and airway remodeling. Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular degradation pathway in eukaryotic cells. There is growing evidence suggesting that dysregulation of autophagy is involved in the pathological process of asthma. Luteolin is a typical flavonoid compound with anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and immune-enhancing functions. Previous studies have shown that luteolin can attenuate airway inflammation and hypersensitivity in asthma. However, whether luteolin can play a role in treating asthma by regulating autophagy remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of luteolin on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthmatic mice, observe its effect on the level of autophagy in lung tissues, and further elucidate its underlying mechanism. The results showed that OVA-induced mice developed airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus over-production and collagen deposition. The number of inflammatory cells, levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and OVA-specific IgE in serum were significantly increased. Furthermore, the infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed along with the activation of autophagy in lung tissues. Luteolin treatment significantly inhibited the OVA-induced inflammatory responses and the level of autophagy in lung tissues as well. Moreover, luteolin activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and inhibited the Beclin-1-PI3KC3 protein complex in lung tissues of asthmatic mice. In conclusion, this study explored the regulatory mechanism of luteolin on autophagy in allergic asthma, providing biologic evidence for its clinical application.",

        "Abstract": "How to fast and accurately assess the severity level of COVID-19 is an essential problem, when millions of people are suffering from the pandemic around the world. Currently, the chest CT is regarded as a popular and informative imaging tool for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, we observe that there are two issues - weak annotation and insufficient data that may obstruct automatic COVID-19 severity assessment with CT images. To address these challenges, we propose a novel three-component method, i.e., 1) a deep multiple instance learning component with instance-level attention to jointly classify the bag and also weigh the instances, 2) a bag-level data augmentation component to generate virtual bags by reorganizing high confidential instances, and 3) a self-supervised pretext component to aid the learning process. We have systematically evaluated our method on the CT images of 229 COVID-19 cases, including 50 severe and 179 non-severe cases. Our method could obtain an average accuracy of 95.8%, with 93.6% sensitivity and 96.4% specificity, which outperformed previous works.",

        "Abstract": "This study evaluates the protective role of oyster peptide (OP) on the occurrence of Exercise-Hypogonadal Male Condition. Male rats were given heavy-load swimming training and / or OP was supplemented for 6 consecutive weeks. After heavy-load training, sperm count, sperm viability and sperm motility in epididymis, testosterone in serum and testis, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) and androgen receptor (AR) in testis and mating times were remarkably decreased, malondialdehyde (MDA), capture latency and mating latency were significantly increased, mRNA expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) and P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) were obviously down-regulated, but serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) were not statistically changed. Conversely, when OP was supplemented at heavy-load training, sperm count, sperm viability and sperm motility in epididymis, serum FSH, LH, testosterone, GSH-px, superoxide dismutase (SOD), testosterone, AR in testis and mating times were dramatically increased, while testicular MDA, capture latency and mating latency were significantly decreased, and mRNA expression of StAR, StARD7, P450scc and 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2-HSD) were significantly up-regulated. In conclusion, heavy-load training causes testicular spermatogenic and steroidogenic disorders by enhancing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be protected by the co-administration of OP by enhancing the function of pituitary gonad axis and lowering ROS generation.",

        "Abstract": "CsSh5.1, which controls hypocotyl elongation under high temperature conditions in cucumber, was mapped to a 57.1 kb region on chromosome 5 containing a candidate gene encoding a xyloglucan galactosyltransferase. Hypocotyl growth is a vital process in seedling establishment. Hypocotyl elongation after germination relies more on longitudinal cell elongation than cell division. Cell elongation is largely determined by the extensibility of the cell wall. Here, we identified a spontaneous mutant in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), sh5.1, which exhibits a temperature-insensitive short hypocotyl phenotype. Genetic analysis showed that the phenotype of sh5.1 was controlled by a recessive nuclear gene. CsSh5.1 was mapped to a 57.1\u00a0kb interval on chromosome 5, containing eight predicted genes. Sequencing analysis revealed that the Csa5G171710 is the candidate gene of CsSh5.1, which was further confirmed via co-segregation analysis and genomic DNA sequencing in natural cucumber variations. The result indicated that hypocotyl elongation might be controlled by this gene. CsSh5.1 encodes a xyloglucan galactosyltransferase that specifically adds galactose to xyloglucan and forms galactosylated xyloglucans, which determine the strength and extensibility of the cell walls. CsSh5.1 expression in wild-type (WT) hypocotyl was significantly higher than that in sh5.1 hypocotyl under high temperature, suggesting its important role in hypocotyl cell elongation under high temperature. The identification of CsSh5.1 is helpful for elucidating the function of xyloglucan galactosyltransferase in cell wall expansion and understanding the mechanism of hypocotyl elongation in cucumber.",

        "Abstract": "Airway remodeling is one of the typical pathological characteristics of asthma, while the structural changes of the airways in asthma are complex, which impedes the development of novel asthma targeted therapy. Our previous study had shown that Bu-Shen-Yi-Qi formula (BSYQF) could ameliorate airway remodeling in chronic asthmatic mice by modulating airway inflammation and oxidative stress in the lung. In this study, we analysed the lung transcriptome of control mice and asthmatic mouse model with/without BSYQF treatment. Using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, we found that 264/1746 (15.1%) of transcripts showing abnormal expression in asthmatic mice were reverted back to completely or partially normal levels by BSYQF treatment. Additionally, based on previous results, we identified 21 differential expression genes (DEGs) with fold changes (FC)\u2009>\u2009(\u00b1) 2.0 related to inflammatory, oxidative stress, mitochondria, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK signal pathways which may play important roles in the mechanism of the anti-remodeling effect of BSYQF treatment. Through inputting 21 DEGs into the IPA database to construct a gene network, we inferred Adipoq, SPP1, and TNC which were located at critical nodes in the network may be key regulators of BSYQF's anti-remodeling effect. In addition, the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) result for the selected four DEGs matched those of the RNA-seq analysis. Our results provide a preliminary clue to the molecular mechanism of the anti-remodeling effect of BSYQF in asthma.",

        "Abstract": "To better understand early brain development in health and disorder, it is critical to accurately segment infant brain magnetic resonance (MR) images into white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance; h owever, one of the major limitations is that the learning-based methods may suffer from the multi-site issue, that is, the models trained on a dataset from one site may not be applicable to the datasets acquired from other sites with different imaging protocols/scanners. To promote methodological development in the community, the iSeg-2019 challenge (http://iseg2019.web.unc.edu) provides a set of 6-month infant subjects from multiple sites with different protocols/scanners for the participating methods. T raining/validation subjects are from UNC (MAP) and testing subjects are from UNC/UMN (BCP), Stanford University, and Emory University. By the time of writing, there are 30 automatic segmentation methods participated in the iSeg-2019. In this article, 8 top-ranked methods were reviewed by detailing their pipelines/implementations, presenting experimental results, and evaluating performance across different sites in terms of whole brain, regions of interest, and gyral landmark curves. We further pointed out their limitations and possible directions for addressing the multi-site issue. We find that multi-site consistency is still an open issue. We hope that the multi-site dataset in the iSeg-2019 and this review article will attract more researchers to address the challenging and critical multi-site issue in practice.",

        "Abstract": "We recently identified epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a trihydroxyphenolic compound, as a dual inhibitor of lysyl oxidase-like2 and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) receptor kinase that when given orally to patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) reversed profibrotic biomarkers in their diagnostic biopsies. Here, we extend these findings to advanced pulmonary fibrosis using cultured precision-cut lung slices from explants of patients with IPF undergoing transplantation. During these experiments, we were surprised to discover that not only did EGCG attenuate TGF\u03b21 signalling and new collagen accumulation but also activated matrix metalloproteinase-dependent collagen I turnover, raising the possibility of slow fibrosis resolution with continued treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin resistance is a major pathophysiologic defect in type 2 diabetes and obesity, while anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages are important in maintaining normal metabolic homeostasis. Here, we show that M2 polarized bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) secrete miRNA-containing exosomes (Exos), which improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity when given to obese mice. Depletion of their miRNA cargo blocks the ability of M2 BMDM Exos to enhance insulin sensitivity. We found that miR-690 is highly expressed in M2 BMDM Exos and functions as an insulin sensitizer both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. Expressing an miR-690 mimic in miRNA-depleted BMDMs generates Exos that recapitulate the effects of M2 BMDM Exos on metabolic phenotypes. Nadk is a bona fide target mRNA of miR-690, and Nadk plays a role in modulating macrophage inflammation and insulin signaling. Taken together, these data suggest miR-690 could be a new therapeutic insulin-sensitizing agent for metabolic disease.",

        "Abstract": "The antidiabetic effect of different doses of water extract (WE) and ethanol extract (EE) was tested on a high-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. Parameters were evaluated with normal control (NC), diabetes mellitus control (DM), and metformin (M) groups. In the experiment, nine groups were used with eight rats in each group and three doses of each WE and EE were used, with low, medium, and high doses. The results revealed that the DM group lost a significant amount of weight, whereas the NC group's weight increased throughout the experiment. After treatment with Fomitopsis pinicola, the EE group's weight increased gradually. Liver, kidney, and pancreas weight decreased after STZ injection and returned to normal in EE treated groups. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were observed to be significantly lower after F. pinicola treatment. Serum insulin levels were also restored to normal after mushroom extracts supplementation. Specifically, STZ-induced hyperglycemia was inhibited by high dose EE administration. The biochemical analysis revealed that high-dose EE treatment increased HDL-C and decreased TC, TG, and LDL-C. Results demonstrated that high-dose EE administration protected the organ tissues from oxidative stress by normalizing the antioxidant levels, and CAT, SOD, and GSH-Px suppressed the lethal effect of MDA. The study concluded that F. pinicola EE at the dose 300 mg/kg has a more hypoglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, antioxidant, and antihyperlipidemic effect than NC, DM, and M, and regulates hyperglycemia by increasing insulin secretion.",

        "Title": "TMT-based quantitative proteomics reveals suppression of SLC3A2 and ATP1A3 expression contributes to the inhibitory role of acupuncture on airway inflammation in an OVA-induced mouse asthma model.",
        "Abstract": "Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease and acupuncture is frequently used in patients suffering from asthma in clinic. However, the regulatory mechanism of acupuncture treatment in asthma is not fully elucidated. We sought to investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture on asthma and the associated regulatory mechanism. An ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse asthma model was established and the effect of acupuncture on airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), mucus hypersecretion and inflammation was assessed. Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics analysis of lung tissue and bioinformatics analysis were performed. Our results revealed that the OVA-induced mouse asthma model was successfully established with the significantly elevated AHR to methacholine (Mch), and acupuncture was effective in attenuation of AHR to Mch, peribronchial and perivascular inflammation and mucus production. The inflammatory cells around the airways, mucous secretion as well as levels of IgE, CCL5, CCL11, IL-17A in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 levels in serum were siginificantly inhibited by acupuncture. TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis found that a total of 6078 quantifiable proteins were identi\ufb01ed, and 564 (334 up-regulated and 230 down regulated) differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identi\ufb01ed in OVA-induced asthma model group (A) versus normal control group (NC). Acupuncture treatment resulted in 667 DEPs (416 up-regulated and 251 down regulated) compared with A group, and 86 overlapping DEPs were identi\ufb01ed in NC, A and AA groups. Among the 86 overlapping DEPs, we identified 41 DEPs regulated by acupuncture. Based on the above data, we performed a systematic bioinformatics analysis of the 41 DEPs, and results showed that these 41 DEPs were predominantly related to 4 KEGG pathways including SNARE interactions in vesicular transport, ferroptosis, endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption, and protein digestion and absorption. DEPs of SLC3A2 and ATP1A3 expression levels were verified by immumohistochemical staining. Mice in OVA-induced asthma model group had elevated SLC3A2 and ATP1A3 expression and acupuncture had the ability to downregulate SLC3A2 and ATP1A3 protein expression. Furthermore, acupuncture reduced the MDA level and increased the GSH and SOD levels in the lung tissue. Taken together, our data suggested that acupuncture was effective in treating asthma by attenuation of AHR, mucus secretion and airway inflammation, and the mechanism was associated with regulation of ferroptosis, SLC3A2 and ATP1A3 protein expression as well as oxidative stress. Results from our experiments revealed the anti-inflammatory effect of acupuncture in OVA-induced mouse asthma model, leading to a more effective approach to be chosen by patients in clinic.",

        "Abstract": "Abnormal cerebral blood flow (CBF) and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) are sensitive biomarkers of disease progression and prognosis. This study investigated neural underpinnings of motor and cognitive recovery by longitudinally studying the changes of CBF and FC in pontine infarction (PI). Twenty patients underwent three-dimensional pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (3D-pcASL), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans, and behavioral assessments at 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months after stroke. Twenty normal control (NC) subjects underwent the same examination once. First, we investigated CBF changes in the acute stage, and longitudinal changes from 1 week to 6 months after PI. Brain regions with longitudinal CBF changes were then used as seeds to investigate longitudinal FC alterations during the follow-up period. Compared with NC, patients in the left PI (LPI) and right PI (RPI) groups showed significant CBF alterations in the bilateral cerebellum and some supratentorial brain regions at the baseline stage. Longitudinal analysis revealed that altered CBF values in the right supramarginal (SMG_R) for the LPI group, while the RPI group showed significantly dynamic changes of CBF in the left calcarine sulcus (CAL_L), middle occipital gyrus (MOG_L), and right supplementary motor area (SMA_R). Using the SMG_R as the seed in the LPI group, FC changes were found in the MOG_L, middle temporal gyrus (MTG_L), and prefrontal lobe (IFG_L). Correlation analysis showed that longitudinal CBF changes in the SMG_R and FC values between the SMG_R and MOG_L were associated with motor and memory scores in the LPI group, and longitudinal CBF changes in the CAL_L and SMA_R were related to memory and motor recovery in the RPI group. These longitudinal CBF and accompany FC alterations may provide insights into the neural mechanism underlying functional recovery after PI, including that of motor and cognitive functions.",

        "Abstract": "The treatment of recurrent cervical cancer, especially pelvic locoregional recurrence, is very challenging for gynecologic oncologists. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with Endostar, a novel modified recombinant human endostatin, in patients with pelvic locoregional recurrence of cervical cancer following surgical treatment.This phase 2 study was conducted between May 2018 and May 2019 at a single center in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and enrolled 31 patients with pelvic locoregional recurrence of cervical cancer following surgical treatment. All patients were treated with IMRT-based CCRT for 6 weeks and intravenous infusions of Endostar (15\u200amg/m), which were administered on days 1 to 7 of CCRT, followed by rest for 4 weeks. After resting, chemotherapy with cisplatin (70\u200amg/m) plus paclitaxel (135-175\u200amg/m) was given every 3 weeks for a total of 4 treatments.Thirty-one patients were evaluable for the primary endpoint. The mean age was 50.03 years (SD 7.72). The objective response rate was 67.74% and the disease control rate was 83.87% (48.39% achieved a complete response, 19.35% a partial response, 16.13% had disease stabilization, and 16.13% had progressive disease). The most common adverse events were nausea, vomiting, alopecia, neutropenia, and leukopenia; most events were grade 1 or 2 in intensity. Grade 3 toxicities included thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in 2 patients each, and leukopenia in 4 patients. No cases of grade 4 acute toxicity were observed.IMRT-based CCRT with Endostar infusions is effective and safe. Our results support the use of this treatment for patients with pelvic locoregional recurrence of cervical cancer following surgical treatment.",

        "Title": "Hypergraph learning for identification of COVID-19 with CT imaging.",
        "Abstract": "The coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, has become the largest global public health crisis since it started in early 2020. CT imaging has been used as a complementary tool to assist early screening, especially for the rapid identification of COVID-19 cases from community acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases. The main challenge in early screening is how to model the confusing cases in the COVID-19 and CAP groups, with very similar clinical manifestations and imaging features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an Uncertainty Vertex-weighted Hypergraph Learning (UVHL) method to identify COVID-19 from CAP using CT images. In particular, multiple types of features (including regional features and radiomics features) are first extracted from CT image for each case. Then, the relationship among different cases is formulated by a hypergraph structure, with each case represented as a vertex in the hypergraph. The uncertainty of each vertex is further computed with an uncertainty score measurement and used as a weight in the hypergraph. Finally, a learning process of the vertex-weighted hypergraph is used to predict whether a new testing case belongs to COVID-19 or not. Experiments on a large multi-center pneumonia dataset, consisting of 2148 COVID-19 cases and 1182 CAP cases from five hospitals, are conducted to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the proposed method. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method on the identification of COVID-19 in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.",
