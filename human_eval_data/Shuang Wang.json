        "Title": "EMP3: A promising biomarker for tumor prognosis and targeted cancer therapy.",
        "Abstract": "Epithelial membrane protein 3 (EMP3) belongs to the peripheral myelin protein 22 kDa (PMP22) gene family, characterized by four transmembrane domains and widespread expression across various human tissues and organs. Other members of the PMP22 family, including EMP1, EMP2, and PMP22, have been linked to various cancers, such as glioblastoma, laryngeal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer. However, few studies report on the function and relevance of EMP3 in tumorigenicity. Given the significant structural similarities among members of the PMP22 family, there are likely potential functional similarities as well. Previous studies have established the regulatory role of EMP3 in immune cells like T cells and macrophages. Additionally, EMP3 is found to be involved in critical signaling pathways, including HER-2/PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and TGF-beta/Smad. Furthermore, EMP3 is associated with cell cycle regulation, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis. Hence, it is likely that EMP3 participates in cancer development through these aforementioned pathways and mechanisms. This review aims to systematically examine and summarize the structure and function of EMP3 and its association to various cancers. EMP3 is expected to emerge as a significant biological marker for tumor prognosis and a potential target in cancer therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "With the rapid development of tumor immunotherapy, nanoparticle vaccines have attracted much attention as potential therapeutic strategies. A systematic review and analysis must be carried out to investigate the effect of mannose modification on the immune response to nanoparticles in regulating the tumor microenvironment, as well as to explore its potential clinical application in tumor therapy. Despite the potential advantages of nanoparticle vaccines in immunotherapy, achieving an effective immune response in the tumor microenvironment remains a challenge. Tumor immune escape and the overexpression of immunosuppressive factors limit its clinical application. Therefore, our review explored how to intervene in the immunosuppressive mechanism in the tumor microenvironment through the use of mannan-decorated lipid calcium phosphate nanoparticle vaccines to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with tumors and to provide new ideas and strategies for the field of tumor therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Improving solar cells' power conversion efficiency (PCE) is crucial to further the deployment of renewable electricity. In addition, solar cells cannot function at exceedingly low temperatures owing to the carrier freeze-out phenomenon. This report demonstrates that through temperature regulation, the PCE of monocrystalline single-junction silicon solar cells can be doubled to 50-60% under monochromatic lasers and the full spectrum of AM 1.5 light at low temperatures of 30-50 K by inhibiting the lattice atoms' thermal oscillations for suppressing thermal loss, an inherent feature of monocrystalline Si cells. Moreover, the light penetration, determined by its wavelength, plays a critical role in alleviating the carrier freeze-out effect and broadening the operational temperature range of silicon cells to temperatures as low as 10 K. Understanding these new observations opens tremendous opportunities for designing solar cells with even higher PCE to provide efficient and powerful energy sources for cryogenic devices and outer and deep space explorations.",

        "Title": "Nutritional Impacts of Dietary Selenium, Iodine and their Interaction on Egg Performance, and Antioxidant Profile in Laying Longyuan Duck Breeders.",
        "Abstract": "The present study aimed to optimize the combined effect of dietary selenium (SE) and iodine (ID) on the productive and reproductive performance and antioxidant capacity of Longyuan breeding ducks. A total of 288 Longyan duck breeders aged 20 wk were randomly assigned to four groups with six replicates (n\u2009=\u200972 ducks/group; 12 ducks/replicate). A 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 factorial arrangement experiment was performed and included 2 supplementation levels of each SE and ID for 200 days of the experimental period. The first group (SE0/ID0) received a basal diet without SE or ID supplementation and was considered to be the control group, whereas the other three groups, SE0/ID4, SE2/ID0 and SE2/ID4, received a basal diet supplemented with 0.4 mg ID/kg, 0.2 mg SE/kg or 0.2 mg SE supplemented with 0.4 mg ID/kg, respectively. The results indicated that the albumin height of the SE2/ID0 group was lower (P\u2009<\u20090.05) than that of the control group, that the egg shape index of the SE2/ID4 and SE0/ID4 groups were lower (P\u2009<\u20090.05) than that of the control group (SE0/ID0), and that the SE concentration significantly increased (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in the SE2/ID0 and SE2/ID4 groups. Hatchability and embryonic mortality improved (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in the SE2/ID0 group. Plasma GSH-Px activity was increased (P\u2009<\u20090.05) by reducing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the SE groups. In addition, the tibia length significantly increased (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in the ID (SE0/ID4 and SE2/ID4) groups compared with that in the control group, the plasma content of IGF-1 in the SE2/ID4 and SE0/ID4 groups were greater (P\u2009<\u20090.05) than that in the control group, and the bone mineral content increased (P\u2009>\u20090.05) in the SE2/ID0 and SE0/ID0 groups. Compared with those in the other groups, the mRNA expression of antioxidant-related genes, including Nrf2 and SHMT1 in the SE2/ID4 group was upregulated (P\u2009>\u20090.05), especially in the SE2/ID4 group. Overall, dietary treatment with SE2/ID4 (0.2 mg SE in 0.4 mg ID/kg diet) could be a suitable feed supplement for improving the the egg quality, health status, endogenous antioxidant content, antioxidant-related gene expression and pre-hatching quality of Longyuan duck breeders.",

        "Abstract": "Endophytic bacteria can promote plant growth and accelerate pollutant degradation. However, it is unclear whether endophytic consortia (Consortium_E) can stabilize colonisation and degradation. We inoculated Consortium_E into the rhizosphere to enhance endophytic bacteria survival and promote pollutant degradation. Rhizosphere-inoculated Consortium_E enhanced polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degradation rates by 11.5-13.1\u00a0% compared with sole bioaugmentation and plant treatments. Stable-isotope-probing (SIP) showed that the rhizosphere-inoculated Consortium_E had the largest number of degraders (8 amplicon sequence variants). Furthermore, only microbes from Consortium_E were identified among the degraders in bioaugmentation treatments, indicating that directly participated in phenanthrene metabolism. Interestingly, Consortium_E reshaped the community structure of degraders without significantly altering the rhizosphere community structure, and strengthened the core position of degraders in the network, facilitating close interactions between degraders and non-degraders in the rhizosphere, which were crucial for ensuring stable functionality. The synergistic effect between plants and Consortium_E significantly enhanced the upregulation of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation and auxiliary degradation pathways in the rhizosphere. These pathways showed a non-significant increasing trend in the uninoculated rhizosphere compared with the control, indicating that Consortium_E primarily promotes rhizosphere effects. Our results explore the Consortium_E bioaugmentation mechanism, providing a theoretical basis for the ecological restoration of contaminated soils.",

        "Abstract": "The fundamental value of universal nomenclatural systems in biology is that they enable unambiguous scientific communication. However, the stability of these systems is threatened by recent discussions asking for a fairer nomenclature, raising the possibility of bulk revision processes for \"inappropriate\" names. It is evident that such proposals come from very deep feelings, but we show how they can irreparably damage the foundation of biological communication and, in turn, the sciences that depend on it. There are four essential consequences of objective codes of nomenclature: universality, stability, neutrality, and transculturality. These codes provide fair and impartial guides to the principles governing biological nomenclature and allow unambiguous universal communication in biology. Accordingly, no subjective proposals should be allowed to undermine them.",

        "Abstract": "Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) perceive calcium signals triggered by abiotic stress and interact with CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) to form a complex signal network. This study identified 21 SsCBL and 89 SsCIPK genes in Saccharum spontaneum, and 90 ScCBL and 367 ScCIPK genes in the sugarcane cultivar ZZ1. Phylogenetic analysis classified CBL genes into three groups and CIPK genes into twenty-five groups, with whole-genome duplication events promoting their expansion in sugarcane. RNA-seq analysis revealed their involvement in abiotic stress responses through ABA, JA, and SA pathways. Four ScCBLs and eight ScCIPKs were cloned from ZZ1. Three CBL-CIPK interactions were detected using a yeast two-hybrid system and Firefly luciferase complementation imaging, showing CBLs as membrane proteins and CIPKs as nuclear proteins. Spatial expression profiles indicate these genes are expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression in roots. Gene expression analyses suggested that CBL-CIPK signaling networks are involved in responses to drought, salt, and reactive oxygen species, possibly through Ca",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the interaction between gut microbiota and brain on ischemic stroke, but the roles of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke remain largely unclear. In this study, we detected a significant increase of intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) following ischemic stroke by a rose bengal photothrombosis model. To investigate the function and mechanism of AKK on ischemic stroke, we performed the AKK administration prior to stroke surgery. The results showed that mice treated with AKK gained significantly higher body weight and behaved better than those in PBS group at 3 days after ischemic stroke. Consistently, AKK administration remarkably decreased the infarct volumes as well as the density of degenerating neurons and apoptotic cells after ischemic stroke. Notably, AKK is a potential therapeutic target in immune-related disorders connected to the microbiota, and inflammation is crucially involved in the pathophysiological process of ischemic stroke. For the determination of underlying mechanisms of this protective effect, we investigated whether there are associations between AKK and neuroinflammation following ischemic stroke. The results suggested that AKK administration significantly reduced the activation of astrocytes and microglia but up-regulated multiple anti-inflammatory factors following ischemic stroke. Therefore, our study highlighted the beneficial roles of intestinal AKK on ischemic stroke and provided a new perspective for the treatment of ischemic stroke.",

        "Abstract": "Addressing the conflict between achieving elevated mechanical stretchability and environmental adaptability is significant to a breakthrough in the practical application of flexible wearable materials. Therefore, inspired by the perceptive and protective properties of human skin, flexible wearable electronic skins (E-skins) based on deep eutectic solvent (DES) liquid and multiresponse eutectogel have been widely considered to be a promising platform for building a flexible wearable management system to achieve the purpose of \"one stone, two birds\". In this work, a multifunctional E-skin was designed based on an ultrastretchable, transparent, self-adhesive, and environmentally tolerant eutectogel by first incorporating cationized modified chitin nanocrystals into a covalently cross-linked polymer network comprised of the skeleton formed by a PAA polymerization network structure serving as a stretchable matrix and filled with DESs (ChCl:EG). The obtained eutectogel exhibits superhigh stretchability (up to 6707%), high toughness (17.7 MJ/m",

        "Abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome characterized by the rapid loss of the renal function and has high morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet there is no satisfactory means of prevention and treatment at present. Dioscin, a natural steroidal saponin, has been found to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. In this experiment, we pretreated cisplatin-induced AKI rats with dioscin and found that dioscin significantly enhanced renal function and reduced renal pathological injury in AKI rats. We also found that dioscin improved renal antioxidant capacity by suppressing the accumulation of oxides such as ROS, MDA and H",

        "Abstract": "Male sex, early life chemical exposure and the brain aromatase enzyme have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In the Barwon Infant Study birth cohort (n\u2009=\u20091074), higher prenatal maternal bisphenol A (BPA) levels are associated with higher ASD symptoms at age 2 and diagnosis at age 9 only in males with low aromatase genetic pathway activity scores. Higher prenatal BPA levels are predictive of higher cord blood methylation across the CYP19A1 brain promoter I.f region (P\u2009=\u20090.009) and aromatase gene methylation mediates (P\u2009=\u20090.01) the link between higher prenatal BPA and brain-derived neurotrophic factor methylation, with independent cohort replication. BPA suppressed aromatase expression in vitro and in vivo. Male mice exposed to mid-gestation BPA or with aromatase knockout have ASD-like behaviors with structural and functional brain changes. 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10HDA), an estrogenic fatty acid alleviated these features and\u00a0reversed detrimental neurodevelopmental gene expression. Here we demonstrate that prenatal BPA exposure is associated with impaired brain aromatase function and ASD-related behaviors and brain abnormalities in males that may be reversible through postnatal 10HDA intervention.",

Under the guidance of captured the spectral imaging data cube with a rigid endoscope based MSI system, a special designed fiber probe passed through the instrumental channel for acquiring the finger-print spectral information from compression rat SCI models. After identifying the main visual features of injured spinal cord tissue in all Sham, 0-, 3- and 7-days post injury (0 DPI, 3 DPI, and 7 DPI) groups, the blood volume and oxygen content were visualized to describe hemorrhage, hypoxia and inflammatory state after acute injury. The averaged reflectance spectra, which were deduced from MSI data cubes, were utilized for describing oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration in living tissue. The results of Raman spectroscopy addressed complex compositional and conformational phenomena during SCI progression, correlated with the well-known event like neuronal apoptosis, hemorrhage, demyelination, and even the upregulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). A principal component analysis and linear discriminate algorithm (PCA-LDA) based discriminate model was introduced for categorizing spectral features in different injury stages, which was applicable for intraoperative interpretations on the complex pathological courses of SCI and therapeutic outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Any opacification of the lens can be defined as cataracts, and lens epithelium cells play a crucial role in guaranteeing lens transparency by maintaining its homeostasis. Although several causative genes of congenital cataracts have been reported, the mechanisms underlying lens opacity remain unclear. In this study, a large family with congenital cataracts was collected and genetic analysis revealed a pathological mutation (c.3857\u00a0C\u2009>\u2009T, p.T1287I) in the GBF1 gene; all affected individuals in the family carried this heterozygous mutation, while unaffected family members did not. Functional studies in human lens epithelium cell line revealed that this mutation led to a reduction in GBF1 protein levels. Knockdown of endogenous GBF1 activated XBP1s in the unfolded protein response signal pathway, and enhances autophagy in an mTOR-independent manner. Heterozygous Gbf1 knockout mice also displayed typic cataract phenotype. Together, our study identified GBF1 as a novel causative gene for congenital cataracts. Additionally, we found that GBF1 deficiency activates the unfolded protein response and leads to enhanced autophagy, which may contribute to lens opacity.",

        "Abstract": "Rhizoremediation and bioaugmentation have proven effective in promoting benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) degradation in contaminated soils. However, the mechanism underlying bioaugmented rhizospheric BaP degradation with native microbes is poorly understood. In this study, an indigenous BaP degrader (Stenotrophomonas BaP-1) isolated from petroleum-contaminated soil was introduced into ryegrass rhizosphere to investigate the relationship between indigenous degraders and rhizospheric BaP degradation. Stable isotope probing and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing subsequently revealed 15 BaP degraders, 8 of which were directly associated with BaP degradation including Bradyrhizobium and Streptomyces. Bioaugmentation with strain BaP-1 significantly enhanced rhizospheric BaP degradation and shaped the microbial community structure. A correlation of BaP degraders, BaP degradation efficiency, and functional genes identified active degraders and genes encoding polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase (PAH-RHD) genes as the primary drivers of rhizospheric BaP degradation. Furthermore, strain BaP-1 was shown to not only engage in BaP metabolism but also to increase the abundance of other BaP degraders and PAH-RHD genes, resulting in enhanced rhizospheric BaP degradation. Metagenomic and correlation analyses indicated a significant positive relationship between glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and BaP degradation, suggesting a role for these pathways in rhizospheric BaP biodegradation. By identifying BaP degraders and characterizing their metabolic characteristics within intricate microbial communities, our study offers valuable insights into the mechanisms of bioaugmented rhizoremediation with indigenous bacteria for high-molecular-weight PAHs in petroleum-contaminated soils.",

        "Abstract": "Disinfection of public drinking water and swimming pools is crucial for preventing waterborne diseases, but it can produce harmful disinfection by-products (DBPs), increasing the risk of various diseases for those frequently exposed to such environments. Bromoacetic acid (BAA) is a ubiquitous DBP, with toxicity studies primarily focused on its in vitro cytotoxicity, and insufficient research on its neurodevelopmental toxicity. Utilizing zebrafish as a model organism, this study comprehensively explored BAA's toxic effects and uncovered the molecular mechanisms through neurobehavioral analysis, in vivo two-photon imaging, transcriptomic sequencing, pharmacological intervention and molecular biological detection. Results demonstrated BAA induced significant changes on various indicators in the early development of zebrafish. Furthermore, BAA disrupted behavioral patterns in zebrafish larvae across locomotion activity, light-dark stimulation, and vibration stimulation paradigms. Subsequent investigation focused on larvae revealed BAA inhibited neuronal development, activated neuroinflammatory responses, and altered vascular morphology. Transcriptomic analysis revealed BAA-stressed zebrafish exhibited downregulation of visual transduction-related genes and activation of ferroptosis and cellular apoptosis. Neurobehavioral disorders were recovered by inhibiting ferroptosis and apoptosis. This study elucidates the neurodevelopmental toxicity associated with BAA, which is crucial for understanding health risks of DBPs and for the development of more effective detection methods and regulatory strategies.",

        "Title": "Identification of key genes and pathways in duck fatty liver syndrome using gene set enrichment analysis.",
        "Abstract": "High-laying ducks are often fed high-energy, nutritious feeds to maintain high productivity, which predisposes them to lipid metabolism disorders and the development of fatty liver syndrome (FLS), which seriously affects production performance and has a substantial economic impact on the poultry industry. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development of fatty liver syndrome. In this study, seven Shan Partridge ducks, each with fatty liver syndrome and normal laying ducks, were selected, and Hematoxylin Eosin staining (HE staining), Masson staining, and transcriptome sequencing were performed on liver tissue. In addition to exploring key genes and pathways using conventional analysis methods, we constructed the first Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database-based predefined gene set containing 12,764 pathways and 16,836 genes and further performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the liver transcriptome data. Finally, key nodes and biological processes were identified via the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The results showed that the liver in the FL group exhibited steatosis and fibrosis, and a total of 3,663 genes with upregulated expression versus 2,296 downregulated genes were screened by conventional analysis. GSEA analysis and PPI network analysis revealed that the liver in the FL group exhibited disruption of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leading to decreased oxidative phosphorylation and the secretion of excessive proinflammatory factors amid the continuous accumulation of lipids. Under continuous chronic inflammation, cell cycle arrest triggers apoptosis, while fibrosis becomes more severe, and procarcinogenic genes are activated, leading to the continuous development and deterioration of the liver. In conclusion, the predefined gene set constructed in this study can be used for GSEA, and the identified hub genes provide useful reference data and a solid foundation for the study of the genetic regulatory mechanism of fatty liver syndrome in ducks.",

The structure of the cross-linked membrane has a strong interaction with phosphoric acid (PA), which enhances proton transport and PA retention. To ensure better overall performance of the cross-linked membrane, the optimal PIL content is 30\u00a0wt% (OPBI-PIL-30\u00a0%). The PA uptake of OPBI-PIL-30\u00a0% membrane was 323.24\u00a0%, and the proton conductivity at 180\u00a0\u2103 was 113.94 mS cm",

        "Title": "NRIMD, a Web Server for Analyzing Protein Allosteric Interactions Based on Molecular Dynamics Simulation.",
        "Abstract": "Long-range allosteric communication between distant sites and active sites in proteins is central to biological regulation but still poorly characterized, limiting the development of protein engineering and drug design. Addressing this gap, NRIMD is an open-access web server for analyzing long-range interactions in proteins from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, such as the effect of mutations at distal sites or allosteric ligand binding at allosteric sites on the active center. Based on our recent works on neural relational inference using graph neural networks, this cloud-based web server accepts MD simulation data on any length of residues in the alpha-carbon skeleton format from mainstream MD software. The input trajectory data are validated at the frontend deployed on the cloud and then processed on the backend deployed on a high-performance computer system with a collection of complementary tools. The web server provides a one-stop-shop MD analysis platform to predict long-range interactions and their paths between distant sites and active sites. It provides a user-friendly interface for detailed analysis and visualization. To the best of our knowledge, NRIMD is the first-of-its-kind online service to provide comprehensive long-range interaction analysis on MD simulations, which significantly lowers the barrier of predictions on protein long-range interactions using deep learning. The NRIMD web server is publicly available at https://nrimd.luddy.indianapolis.iu.edu/.",

        "Abstract": "In response to the issue of harvesting machine failures affecting crop harvesting timing, this study develops an emergency scheduling model and proposes a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines a genetic algorithm and an ant colony algorithm. By enhancing the genetic algorithm's crossover and mutation methods and incorporating the ant colony algorithm, the proposed algorithm can prevent local optima, thus minimizing disruptions to the overall scheduling plan. Field data from Deyang, Sichuan Province, were utilized, and simulations on various harvesting machines experiencing random faults were conducted. Results indicated that the improved genetic algorithm reduced the optimal comprehensive scheduling cost during random fault occurrences by 47.49%, 19.60%, and 32.45% compared to the basic genetic algorithm and by 34.70%, 14.80%, and 24.40% compared to the ant colony algorithm. The improved algorithm showcases robust global optimization capabilities, high stability, and rapid convergence, offering effective emergency scheduling solutions in case of harvesting machine failures. Furthermore, a visual management system for agricultural machinery scheduling was developed to provide software support for optimizing agricultural machinery scheduling.",

The involvement of temperature stimulation in the development of IBD remains uncertain. Our preliminary statistical data suggest that the prevalence of IBD is slightly lower in colder regions compared to non-cold regions. The observation indicates that temperature changes may play a key role in the occurrence and progression of IBD. Here, we hypothesized that cold stress has a protective effect on IBD.",

        "Abstract": "The human body comprises numerous organs and tissues operating in synchrony, it facilitates metabolism, circulation, and overall organismal function. Consequently, the well-being of our organs and tissues significantly influences our overall health. In recent years, research on the protective effects of artesunate (AS) on various organ functions, including the heart, liver, brain, lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, bones, and others has witnessed significant advancements. Findings from in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that AS may emerge as a newfound guardian against organ damage. Its protective mechanisms primarily entail the inhibition of inflammatory factors and affect anti-fibrotic, anti-aging, immune-enhancing, modulation of stem cells, apoptosis, metabolic homeostasis, and autophagy properties. Moreover, AS is attracting a high level of interest because of its obvious antioxidant activities, including the activation of Nrf2 and HO-1 signaling pathways, inhibiting the release of reactive oxygen species, and interfering with the expression of genes and proteins associated with oxidative stress. This review comprehensively outlines the recent strides made by AS in alleviating organismal injuries stemming from various causes and protecting organs, aiming to serve as a reference for further in-depth research and utilization of AS.",

        "Abstract": "Factor-dependent termination uses molecular motors to remodel transcription machineries, but the associated mechanisms, especially in eukaryotes, are poorly understood. Here we use single-molecule fluorescence assays to characterize in real time the composition and the catalytic states of Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription termination complexes remodeled by Sen1 helicase. We confirm that Sen1 takes the RNA transcript as its substrate and translocates along it by hydrolyzing multiple ATPs to form an intermediate with a stalled RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription elongation complex (TEC). We show that this intermediate dissociates upon hydrolysis of a single ATP leading to dissociation of Sen1 and RNA, after which Sen1 remains bound to the RNA. We find that Pol II ends up in a variety of states: dissociating from the DNA substrate, which is facilitated by transcription bubble rewinding, being retained to the DNA substrate, or diffusing along the DNA substrate. Our results provide a complete quantitative framework for understanding the mechanism of Sen1-dependent transcription termination in eukaryotes.",

        "Abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, encompasses steatosis and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Preclinical MASLD research is mainly performed in rodents; however, the model that best recapitulates human disease is yet to be defined. We conducted a wide-ranging retrospective review (metabolic phenotype, liver histopathology, transcriptome benchmarked against humans) of murine models (mostly male) and ranked them using an unbiased MASLD 'human proximity score' to define their metabolic relevance and ability to induce MASH-fibrosis. Here, we show that Western diets align closely with human MASH; high cholesterol content, extended study duration and/or genetic manipulation of disease-promoting pathways are required to intensify liver damage and accelerate significant (F2+) fibrosis development. Choline-deficient models rapidly induce MASH-fibrosis while showing relatively poor translatability. Our ranking of commonly used MASLD models, based on their proximity to human MASLD, helps with the selection of appropriate in vivo models to accelerate preclinical research.",

        "Abstract": "Radio-immunotherapy exploits the immunostimulatory features of ionizing radiation (IR) to enhance antitumor effects and offers emerging opportunities for treating invasive tumor indications such as melanoma. However, insufficient dose deposition and immunosuppressive microenvironment (TME) of solid tumors limit its efficacy. Here we report a programmable sequential therapeutic strategy based on multifunctional fusogenic liposomes (Lip@AUR-ACP-aptPD-L1) to overcome the intrinsic radio-immunotherapeutic resistance of solid tumors. Specifically, fusogenic liposomes are loaded with gold-containing Auranofin (AUR) and inserted with multivariate-gated aptamer assemblies (ACP) and PD-L1 aptamers in the lipid membrane, potentiating melanoma-targeted AUR delivery while transferring ACP onto cell surface through selective membrane fusion. AUR amplifies IR-induced immunogenic death of melanoma cells to release antigens and damage-associated molecular patterns such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for triggering adaptive antitumor immunity. AUR-sensitized radiotherapy also upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression that combined with released ATP to activate ACP through an \"and\" logic operation-like process (AND-gate), thus triggering the in-situ release of engineered cytosine-phosphate-guanine aptamer-based immunoadjuvants (eCpG) for stimulating dendritic cell-mediated T cell priming. Furthermore, AUR inhibits tumor-intrinsic vascular endothelial growth factor signaling to suppress infiltration of immunosuppressive cells for fostering an anti-tumorigenic TME. This study offers an approach for solid tumor treatment in the clinics.",

        "Abstract": "Measurement device independent quantum key distribution (MDI QKD) has attracted growing attention for its immunity to attacks at the measurement unit, but its unique structure limits the secret key rate. Utilizing the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique and reducing error rates are effective strategies for enhancing the secret key rate. Reducing error rates often requires active feedback control of wavelengths using precise external references. However, for a multiwavelength laser, employing multiple references to stabilize each wavelength output places stringent demands on these references and significantly increases system complexity. Here, we demonstrate a stable, wavelength-tunable multiwavelength laser with an output wavelength ranging from 1270 to 1610\u00a0nm. Through precise temperature control and stable drive current, we passively lock the laser wavelength, achieving remarkable wavelength stability. This significantly reduce the error rate, leading to an almost doubling of the secret key rate compared to previous experiments. Furthermore, the exceptional wavelength stability offered by our multiwavelength laser, combined with the WDM technique, has further boosted the secret key rate of MDI QKD. With a wide wavelength tuning range of 5.1\u00a0nm, our multiwavelength laser facilitates flexible operation across multiple dense wavelength division multiplexing channels. Coupled with high wavelength stability and multiple wavelength outputs simultaneously, this laser offers a promising solution for a high-rate MDI QKD system.",

        "Abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides future-proof security for data communications over optical networks. Currently, sophisticated QKD systems are developed and the scale of QKD-secured optical networks (QKD-ONs) becomes larger. Given the complex network conditions and dynamic end-to-end security services in QKD-ONs, autonomic management and control becomes a promising paradigm to support end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) assurance in an efficient and stable way without requiring human intervention. Hence, to enable and utilize the autonomic functionalities over QKD-ONs for realizing the end-to-end QoS assurance becomes a challenge. This work enhances the software defined networking (SDN) technique to tackle this challenge because SDN can add programmability and flexibility for QKD-ON's management and control. A new architecture of SDN-based QKD-ONs supporting autonomic end-to-end QoS assurance is designed, where a knowledge engine with autonomic control loops is developed in the SDN controller. We present the autonomic end-to-end QoS assurance procedure, and the cross-layer collaborative QoS assurance (CLC-QA) strategy for implementing the autonomic functionalities in the network level over QKD-ONs. We also establish an experimental testbed of SDN-based QKD-ONs supporting autonomic end-to-end QoS assurance, and perform the numerical simulation to verify our proposed approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that our presented approaches can achieve the millisecond-level overall latency of 337\u2005ms and 618\u2005ms, during the first and second autonomic adjustment without human intervention in case of the autonomic QoS protection. Moreover, the CLC-QA strategy is evaluated under different traffic loads by being compared with the baseline strategy without cross-layer collaboration. It can improve 22.5% protection success ratio and save 5.7% average key consumption.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatocellular lipid accumulation characterizes fatty liver in dairy cows. Lipid droplets (LD), specialized organelles that store lipids and maintain cellular lipid homeostasis, are responsible for the ectopic storage of lipids associated with several metabolic disorders. In recent years, non-ruminant studies have reported that LD-mitochondria interactions play an important role in lipid metabolism. Due to the role of diacylglycerol acyltransferase isoforms (DGAT1 and DGAT2) in LD synthesis, we explored mechanisms of mitochondrial fatty acid transport in ketotic cows using liver biopsies and isolated primary hepatocytes. Compared with healthy cows, cows with fatty liver had massive accumulation of LD and high protein expression of the triglyceride (TAG) synthesis-related enzymes DGAT1 and DGAT2, LD synthesis-related proteins perilipin 2 (PLIN2) and perilipin 5 (PLIN5), and the mitochondrial fragmentation-related proteins dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and fission 1 (FIS1). In contrast, factors associated with fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial fusion and mitochondrial electron transport chain complex were lower compared with those in the healthy cows. In addition, transmission electron microscopy revealed significant contacts between LD-mitochondria in liver tissue from cows with fatty liver. Compared with isolated cytoplasmic mitochondria, expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A) and DRP1 was lower, but mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and mitochondrial electron transport chain complex was greater in isolated peridroplet mitochondria from hepatic tissue of cows with fatty liver. In vitro data indicated that exogenous free fatty acids (FFA) induced hepatocyte LD synthesis and mitochondrial dynamics consistent with in vivo results. Furthermore, DGAT2 inhibitor treatment attenuated the FFA-induced upregulation of PLIN2 and PLIN5 and rescued the impairment of mitochondrial dynamics. Inhibition of DGAT2 also restored mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced hepatocyte reactive oxygen species production. The present in vivo and in vitro results indicated there are functional differences among different types of mitochondria in the liver tissue of dairy cows with ketosis. Activity of DGAT2 may play a key role in maintaining liver mitochondrial function and lipid homeostasis in dairy cows during the transition period.",

        "Abstract": "Haloferax and Halobellus are the representatives of the family Haloferacaceae and they are dominant in hypersaline ecosystems. Some Haloferax and Halobellus species exhibit a close evolutionary relationship. Genomic, phylogenetic (based on 16S rRNA gene sequence), and phylogenomic analysis were performed to evaluate the taxonomic positions of the genera Haloferax and Halobellus. Based on the results we propose to reclassify Halobellus ramosii as a later heterotypic synonym of Halobellus inordinatus; Haloferax lucentense and Haloferax alexandrinum as later heterotypic synonyms of Haloferax volcanii.",

        "Abstract": "To test the hypothesis that early-life adversity accelerates the pace of biological aging, we analyzed data from the Dutch Hunger Winter Families Study (DHWFS, N = 951). DHWFS is a natural-experiment birth-cohort study of survivors of in-utero exposure to famine conditions caused by the German occupation of the Western Netherlands in Winter 1944 to 1945, matched controls, and their siblings. We conducted DNA methylation analysis of blood samples collected when the survivors were aged 58 to quantify biological aging using the DunedinPACE, GrimAge, and PhenoAge epigenetic clocks. Famine survivors had faster DunedinPACE, as compared with controls. This effect was strongest among women. Results were similar for GrimAge, although effect-sizes were smaller. We observed no differences in PhenoAge between survivors and controls. Famine effects were not accounted for by blood-cell composition and were similar for individuals exposed early and later in gestation. Findings suggest in-utero undernutrition may accelerate biological aging in later life.",

        "Abstract": "Continuum manipulators (CMs) show great potential in transoral laryngeal surgery due to their flexibility. However, CMs for transoral surgery face several issues: large size, which reduces practicality; intersegment coupling, which causes undesired deflection; and a lack of versatility that limits their applicability across different patient groups.",

        "Abstract": "The Exiguobacterium genus comprises Gram-stain-positive and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. Some Exiguobacterium species have previously shown significant high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with each other. This study evaluates the taxonomic classification of those Exiguobacterium species through comprehensive genome analysis. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were determined for various Exiguobacterium species pairs. The ANI and dDDH values between Exiguobacterium enclense and Exiguobacterium indicum, Exiguobacterium aquaticum and Exiguobacterium mexicanum, Exiguobacterium\u00a0soli\u00a0and Exiguobacterium antarcticum, and Exiguobacterium sibiricum and Exiguobacterium artemiae were above the cut-off level (95-96% for ANI and 70% for dDDH) for species delineation. Based on the findings, we propose to reclassify Exiguobacterium enclense as a later heterotypic synonym of Exiguobacterium indicum, Exiguobacterium aquaticum as a later heterotypic synonym of Exiguobacterium mexicanum, Exiguobacterium\u00a0soli\u00a0as a later heterotypic synonym of Exiguobacterium antarcticum and Exiguobacterium sibiricum as a later heterotypic synonym of Exiguobacterium artemiae.",

        "Title": "MicroRNA expression profile of chicken liver at different times after Histomonas meleagridis infection.",
        "Abstract": "Histomonas meleagridis, an anaerobic intercellular parasite, is known to infect gallinaceous birds, particularly turkeys and chickens. The resurgence of histomonosis in recent times has resulted in significant financial setbacks due to the prohibition of drugs used for disease treatment. Currently, research on about H. meleagridis primarily concentrate on the examination of its virulence, gene expression analysis, and the innate immunity response of the host organism. However, there is a lack of research on differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) related to liver infection induced by H. meleagridis. In this study, the weight gain and pathological changes at various post-infection time points were evaluated through animal experiments to determine the peak and early stages of infection. Next, High-throughput sequencing was used to examine the expression profile of liver miRNA at 10 and 15 days post-infection (DPI) in chickens infected with the Chinese JSYZ-F strain of H. meleagridis. A comparison with uninfected controls revealed the presence of 120 and 118 DEMs in the liver of infected chickens at 10 DPI and 15 DPI, respectively, with 74 DEMs being shared between the two time points. Differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs) were categorized into three groups based on the time post-infection. The first group (L1) includes 45 miRNAs that were differentially expressed only at 10 DPI and were predicted to target 1646 genes. The second group (L2) includes 43 miRNAs that were differentially expressed only at 15 DPI and were predicted to target 2257 genes. The third group (L3) includes 75 miRNAs that were differentially expressed at both 10 DPI and 15 DPI and were predicted to target 1623 genes. At L1, L2, and L3, there were 89, 87, and 41 significantly enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms, respectively (p<0.05). The analysis of differentially expressed miRNA target genes using KEGG pathways revealed significant enrichment at L1, L2, and L3, with 3, 4, and 5 pathways identified, respectively (p<0.05). This article suggests that the expression of liver miRNA undergoes dynamic alterations due to H. meleagridis and the host. It showed that the expression pattern of L1 class DEMs was more conducive to regulating the development of the inflammatory response, while the L2 class DEMs were more conducive to augmenting the inflammatory response. The observed patterns of miRNA expression associated with inflammation were in line with the liver's inflammatory process following infection. The results of this study provide a basis for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the pathogenic mechanism of H. meleagridis from the perspective of host miRNAs.",

        "Abstract": "A significant reduction in plasma concentration of cholesterol during early lactation is a common occurrence in high-yielding dairy cows. An insufficient synthesis of cholesterol in the liver has been linked to lipid accumulation caused by high concentrations of fatty acids during negative energy balance (NEB). As ruminant diets do not provide quantitative amounts of cholesterol for absorption, phytosterols such as \u03b2-sitosterol may serve to mitigate the shortfall in cholesterol within the liver during NEB. To gain mechanistic insights, primary hepatocytes were isolated from healthy female 1-day old calves for in vitro studies with or without 1.2\u202fmM fatty acids (FA) to induce metabolic stress. Furthermore, hepatocytes were treated with 50\u202f\u03bcM \u03b2-sitosterol with or without FA. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with subsequent Bonferroni correction. Results revealed that calf hepatocytes treated with FA had greater content of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and triacylglycerol (TAG), and greater mRNA and protein abundance of the lipid synthesis-related SREBF1 and FASN. In contrast, mRNA and protein of CPT1A (fatty acid oxidation) and the cholesterol metabolism-related targets SREBF2, HMGCR, ACAT2, APOA1, ABCA1 and ABCG5 was lower. Content of the antioxidant-related glutathione (GSH) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) also was lower. Compared with FA challenge alone, 50\u202f\u03bcM \u03b2-sitosterol led to greater mRNA and protein abundance of SREBF2, HMGCR, ACAT2 and ABCG5, and greater content of GSH and activity of SOD. In contrast, compared with the FA group, the mRNA and protein abundance of SREBF1 and ACC1 and the content of TAG and NEFA in the \u03b2-sitosterol + FA group were lower. Overall, \u03b2-sitosterol can promote cholesterol metabolism and reduce oxidative stress while reducing lipid accumulation in hepatocytes challenged with high concentrations of fatty acids.",

        "Abstract": "GDF15 (growth differentiation factor 15) is a marker of cellular energetic stress linked to physical-mental illness, aging, and mortality. However, questions remain about its dynamic properties and measurability in human biofluids other than blood. Here, we examine the natural dynamics and psychobiological regulation of plasma and saliva GDF15 in four human studies representing 4,749 samples from 188 individuals. We show that GDF15 protein is detectable in saliva (8% of plasma concentration), likely produced by salivary glands secretory duct cells. Using a brief laboratory socio-evaluative stressor paradigm, we find that psychosocial stress increases plasma (+3.5-5.9%) and saliva GDF15 (+43%) with distinct kinetics, within minutes. Moreover, saliva GDF15 exhibits a robust awakening response, declining by ~40-89% within 30-45 minutes from its peak level at the time of waking up. Clinically, individuals with genetic mitochondrial OxPhos diseases show elevated baseline plasma and saliva GDF15, and post-stress GDF15 levels in both biofluids correlate with multi-system disease severity, exercise intolerance, and the subjective experience of fatigue. Taken together, our data establish that saliva GDF15 is dynamic, sensitive to psychological states, a clinically relevant endocrine marker of mitochondrial diseases. These findings also point to a shared psychobiological pathway integrating metabolic and mental stress.",

        "Title": "Cortactin controls bone homeostasis through regulating the differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts.",
        "Abstract": "Cortactin (CTTN), a cytoskeletal protein and substrate of Src kinase, is implicated in tumor aggressiveness. However, its role in bone cell differentiation remains unknown. The current study revealed that CTTN was upregulated during osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation. Functional experiments demonstrated that CTTN promoted the in vitro differentiation of mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. Mechanistically, CTTN was able to stabilize the protein level of mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR), leading to the activation of mTOR signaling. In-depth investigation revealed that CTTN could bind with casitas B lineage lymphoma-c (c-CBL) and counteract the function of c-CBL, a known E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the proteasomal degradation of mTOR. Silencing c-Cbl alleviated the impaired differentiation of osteoblasts and adipocytes caused by CTTN siRNA, while silencing mTOR mitigated the stimulation of osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation induced by CTTN overexpression. Notably, transplantation of CTTN-silenced bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) into the marrow of mice led to a reduction in trabecular bone mass, accompanied by a decrease in osteoblasts and an increase in osteoclasts. Furthermore, CTTN-silenced BMSCs expressed higher levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL) than control BMSCs did and promoted osteoclast differentiation when cocultured with bone marrow-derived osteoclast precursor cells. This study provides evidence that CTTN favors osteoblast differentiation by counteracting the c-CBL-induced degradation of mTOR and inhibits osteoclast differentiation by downregulating the expression of RANKL. It also suggests that maintaining an appropriate level of CTTN expression may be advantageous for maintaining bone homeostasis.",

The new transformation has a broad substrate scope, does not require any added reagents, and proceeds under room temperature in a short time. A mechanistic rationale for the sequential dearomatization/rearrangement is also presented. Furthermore, the synthetic compounds are evaluated for their glucose control effect. Compounds ",

        "Abstract": "The molecular generation task stands as a pivotal step in the domains of computational chemistry and drug discovery, aiming to computationally generate molecular structures for specific properties. In contrast to previous models that focused primarily on SMILES strings or molecular graphs, our model placed a special emphasis on the substructure information on molecules, enabling the model to learn richer chemical rules and structure features from fragments and chemical reaction information on molecules. To accomplish this, we fragmented the molecules to construct heterogeneous graph representations based on atom and fragment information. Then our model mapped the heterogeneous graph data into a latent vector space by using an encoder and employed a self-regressive generative model as a decoder for molecular generation. Additionally, we performed transfer learning on the model using a small set of ligand molecules known to be active against the target protein to generate molecules that bind better to the target protein. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is highly competitive with state-of-the-art models. It can generate valid and diverse molecules with favorable physicochemical properties and drug-likeness. Importantly, they produce novel molecules with high docking scores against the target proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancies worldwide, and its high morbidity and mortality have brought a heavy burden to the global public health system. Due to the concealment of its onset, the limitation of treatment, the acquisition of multi-drug resistance and radiation resistance, the treatment of HCC cannot achieve satisfactory results. Epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) is a key process that induces progression, distant metastasis, and therapeutic resistance to a variety of malignant tumors, including HCC. Therefore, targeting EMT has become a promising tumor immunotherapy method for HCC. The NF-\u03baB pathway is a key regulatory pathway for EMT. Targeting this pathway has shown potential to inhibit HCC infiltration, invasion, distant metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. At present, there are still some controversies about this pathway and new ideas of combined therapy, which need to be further explored. This article reviews the progress of immunotherapy in improving EMT development in HCC cells by exploring the mechanism of regulating EMT.",

        "Abstract": "Floral transition, the switch from vegetative to reproductive growth, is extremely important for the growth and development of flowering plants. In the summer chrysanthemum, CmBBX8, a member of the subgroup II B-box (BBX) family, positively regulates the transition by physically interacting with CmERF3 to inhibit CmFTL1 expression. In this study, we show that CmBBX5, a B-box subgroup I member comprising two B-boxes and a CCT domain, interacts with CmBBX8. This interaction suppresses the recruitment of CmBBX8 to the CmFTL1 locus without affecting its transcriptional activation activity. CmBBX5 overexpression led to delayed flowering under both LD (long-day) and SD (short-day) conditions, while lines expressing the chimeric repressor gene-silencing (CmBBX5-SRDX) exhibited the opposite phenotype. Subsequent genetic evidence indicated that in regulating flowering, CmBBX5 is partially dependent on CmBBX8. Moreover, during the vegetative growth period, levels of CmBBX5 expression were found to exceed those of CmBBX8. Collectively, our findings indicate that both CmERF3 and CmBBX5 interact with CmBBX8 to dampen the regulation of CmFTL1 via distinct mechanisms, which contribute to preventing the premature flowering of summer chrysanthemum.",

        "Abstract": "The genus Lilium (Lilium) has been widely used in East Asia for over 2000\u00a0years due to its rich nutritional and medicinal value, serving as both food and medicinal ingredient. Polysaccharides, as one of the most important bioactive components in Lilium, offer various health benefits. Recently, polysaccharides from Lilium plants have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their diverse biological properties including immunomodulatory, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, anti-aging and anti-radiation effects. However, the limited comprehensive understanding of polysaccharides from Lilium plants has hindered their development and utilization. This review focuses on the extraction, purification, structural characteristics, biological activities, structure-activity relationships, applications, and relevant bibliometrics of polysaccharides from Lilium plants. Additionally, it delves into the potential development and future research directions. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive understanding of polysaccharides from Lilium plants and to serve as a basis for further research and development as therapeutic agents and multifunctional biomaterials.",

        "Abstract": "Stretchable ionogels, as soft ion-conducting materials, have generated significant interest. However, the integration of multiple functions into a single ionogel, including temperature tolerance, self-adhesiveness, and stability in diverse environments, remains a challenge. In this study, a new class of fluorine-containing ionogels was synthesized through photo-initiated copolymerization of fluorinated hexafluorobutyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate in a fluorinated ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide. The resulting ionogels demonstrate good stretchability with a fracture strain of ~1300%. Owing to the advantages of the fluorinated network and the ionic liquid, the ionogels show excellent stability in air and vacuum, as well as in various solvent media such as water, sodium chloride solution, and hexane. Additionally, the ionogels display impressive wide temperature tolerance, functioning effectively within a wide temperature range from -60 to 350 \u00b0C. Moreover, due to their adhesive properties, the ionogels can be easily attached to various substrates, including plastic, rubber, steel, and glass. Sensors made of these ionogels reliably respond to repetitive tensile-release motion and finger bending in both air and underwater. These findings suggest that the developed ionogels hold great promise for application in wearable devices.",

        "Abstract": "There are complex and diverse substances in traditional vinegars, some of which have been identified as biologically active factors, but the variety of functional compounds is currently restricted. In this study, it was aimed to determine the bioactive compounds in 10 typical functional vinegars. The findings shown that total flavonoids (0.21-7.19\u00a0mg rutin equivalent/mL), total phenolics (0.36-3.20\u00a0mg gallic acid equivalent/mL), and antioxidant activities (DPPH: 3.17-47.63\u00a0mmol trolox equivalent/L, ABTS: 6.85-178.29\u00a0mmol trolox equivalent/L) varied among different functional vinegars. In addition, the concentrations of the polysaccharides (1.17-44.87\u00a0mg glucose equivalent/mL) and total saponins (0.67-12.46\u00a0mg oleanic acid equivalent/mL) were determined, which might play key role for the function of tested vinegars. A total of 8 organic acids, 7 polyphenol compounds and 124 volatile compounds were measured and tentatively identified. The protocatechuic acid (4.81-485.72\u00a0mg/L), chlorogenic acid (2.69-7.52\u00a0mg/L), and epicatechin (1.18-97.42\u00a0mg/L) were important polyphenol compounds in the functional vinegars. Redundancy analysis indicated that tartaric acid, oxalic acid and chlorogenic acid were significantly positively correlated with antioxidant capacity. Various physiologically active ingredients including cyclo (Pro-Leu), cyclo (Phe-Pro), cyclo (Phe-Val), cyclo (Pro-Val), 1-monopalmitin and 1-eicosanol were firstly detected in functional vinegars. Principle component analysis revealed that volatiles profile of bergamot Monascus aromatic vinegar and Hengshun honey vinegar exhibited distinctive differences from other eight vinegar samples. Moreover, the partial least squares regression analysis demonstrated that 11 volatile compounds were positively correlated with the antioxidant activity of vinegars, which suggested these compounds might be important functional substances in tested vinegars. This study explored several new functionally active compounds in different functional vinegars, which could widen the knowledge of bioactive factor in vinegars and provide new ideas for further development of functional vinegar beverages.",

        "Abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer is among the deadliest gynecological tumors worldwide. Clinical treatment usually consists of surgery and adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapies. Due to the high rate of recurrence and rapid development of drug resistance, the current focus of research is on finding effective natural products with minimal toxic side effects for treating epithelial ovarian tumors. Cannabidiol is among the most abundant cannabinoids and has a non-psychoactive effect compared to tetrahydrocannabinol, which is a key advantage for clinical application. Studies have shown that cannabidiol has antiproliferative, pro-apoptotic, cytotoxic, antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. However, its therapeutic value for epithelial ovarian tumors remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of cannabidiol on epithelial ovarian tumors and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that cannabidiol has a significant inhibitory effect on epithelial ovarian tumors. ",

        "Abstract": "Generative molecular models generate novel molecules with desired properties by searching chemical space. Traditional combinatorial optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, have demonstrated superior performance in various molecular optimization tasks. However, these methods do not utilize docking simulation to inform the design process, and heavy dependence on the quality and quantity of available data, as well as require additional structural optimization to become candidate drugs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel model named DockingGA that combines Transformer neural networks and genetic algorithms to generate molecules with better binding affinity for specific targets. In order to generate high quality molecules, we chose the Self-referencing Chemical Structure Strings to represent the molecule and optimize the binding affinity of the molecules to different targets. Compared to other baseline models, DockingGA proves to be the optimal model in all docking results for the top 1, 10 and 100 molecules, while maintaining 100% novelty. Furthermore, the distribution of physicochemical properties demonstrates the ability of DockingGA to generate molecules with favorable and appropriate properties. This innovation creates new opportunities for the application of generative models in practical drug discovery.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity is a metabolic disorder closely associated with profound alterations in gut microbial composition. However, the dynamics of species composition and functional changes in the gut microbiome in obesity remain to be comprehensively investigated. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of metagenomic sequencing data from both obese and non-obese individuals across multiple cohorts, totaling 1351 fecal metagenomes. Our results demonstrate a significant decrease in both the richness and diversity of the gut bacteriome and virome in obese patients. We identified 38 bacterial species including Eubacterium sp. CAG:274, Ruminococcus gnavus, Eubacterium eligens and Akkermansia muciniphila, and 1 archaeal species, Methanobrevibacter smithii, that were significantly altered in obesity. Additionally, we observed altered abundance of five viral families: Mesyanzhinovviridae, Chaseviridae, Salasmaviridae, Drexlerviridae, and Casjensviridae. Functional analysis of the gut microbiome indicated distinct signatures associated to obesity and identified Ruminococcus gnavus as the primary driver for function enrichment in obesity, and Methanobrevibacter smithii, Akkermansia muciniphila, Ruminococcus bicirculans, and Eubacterium siraeum as functional drivers in the healthy control group. Additionally, our results suggest that antibiotic resistance genes and bacterial virulence factors may influence the development of obesity. Finally, we demonstrated that gut vOTUs achieved a diagnostic accuracy with an optimal area under the curve of 0.766 for distinguishing obesity from healthy controls. Our findings offer comprehensive and generalizable insights into the gut bacteriome and virome features associated with obesity, with the potential to guide the development of microbiome-based diagnostics.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, the core idea of the refined method of population spatial distribution is to establish a correlation between the population and auxiliary data at the administrative-unit level and, then, refine it to the grid unit. However, this method ignores the advantages of public population spatial distribution data. Given these problems, this study proposed a partition strategy using the natural break method at the grid-unit level, which adopts the population density to constrain the land class weight and redistributes the population under the dual constraints of land class and area weights. Accordingly, we used the dasymetric method to refine the population distribution data. The study established a partition model for public population spatial distribution data and auxiliary data at the grid-unit level and, then, refined it to smaller grid units. This method effectively utilizes the public population spatial distribution data and solves the problem of the dataset being not sufficiently accurate to describe small-scale regions and low resolutions. Taking the public WorldPop population spatial distribution dataset as an example, the results indicate that the proposed method has higher accuracy than other public datasets and can also describe the actual spatial distribution characteristics of the population accurately and intuitively. Simultaneously, this provides a new concept for research on population spatial distribution refinement methods.",

        "Abstract": "Leukemia is a widespread hematological malignancy characterized by an elevated white blood cell count in both the blood and the bone marrow. Despite notable advancements in leukemia intervention in the clinic, a large proportion of patients, especially acute leukemia patients, fail to achieve long-term remission or complete remission following treatment. Therefore, leukemia therapy necessitates optimization to meet the treatment requirements. In recent years, a multitude of materials have undergone rigorous study to serve as delivery vectors or direct intervention agents to bolster the effectiveness of leukemia therapy. These materials include liposomes, protein-based materials, polymeric materials, cell-derived materials, and inorganic materials. They possess unique characteristics and are applied in a broad array of therapeutic modalities, including chemotherapy, gene therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and other evolving treatments. Here, an overview of these materials is presented, describing their physicochemical properties, their role in leukemia treatment, and the challenges they face in the context of clinical translation. This review inspires researchers to further develop various materials that can be used to augment the efficacy of multiple therapeutic modalities for novel applications in leukemia treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Solar energy, as a clean energy source, is becoming increasingly important in the global energy mix. However, particle deposition on the surface of photovoltaic (PV) panels can significantly reduce their power generation efficiency. In this study, the collision-deposition behaviour between silica particles and the surface of PV modules is investigated. The impact process of 13\u00a0\u03bcm silica particles on the glass surface was recorded by using a high-speed digital camera at various incident velocities and angles. A particle dynamics model was developed to predict the critical capture velocity of particles at different incident angles. It was observed that the critical capture velocity of the particles decreases as the angle of incidence increases. Subsequently, a correlation equation was established between the incident angle and the critical capture velocity, serving as the deposition criterion. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) numerical simulation was employed to simulate particle deposition on PV surfaces under different wind speeds and installation tilting angles. The simulation results demonstrate that the mass of 13\u00a0\u03bcm silica particles deposited on the surface of PV panels decreases with increasing wind speed. Moreover, under identical inlet wind speeds, the particle deposition mass exhibits an initial decrease followed by a subsequent increase as the installation tilt angle of the PV panel increases. The distribution pattern of particle deposition on PV panel surfaces is diverse; however, predominantly concentrated at the mid-bottom region.",

        "Abstract": "The dietary inflammatory index (DII) is a measure of the inflammatory potential of the diet and is closely associated with insulin resistance (IR) and stroke. And IR may play an important role in the development of stroke. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between DII and stroke risk while delving into the potential role of IR in this association. We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2018, performing weighted univariate analyses, logistic regression, and mediation analyses. At baseline, 3.89% of participants developed stroke, and we observed stroke patients exhibited higher DII scores. After adjusting for covariates, compared to participants in the first quartile of DII scores, those in the third quartile and fourth quartile had increased odds of experiencing a stroke (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.18-2.68) and (OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.16-2.50), respectively. Moreover, a significant dose-response relationship was observed (P-trend\u2009<\u20090.05). However, there was no observed interaction between DII and homeostatic model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) concerning stroke risk, and HOMA-IR did not mediate the association between DII and stroke. In summary, our study elucidated the significant association between DII and stroke risk, independent of IR. This insight suggests that an anti-inflammatory diet may serve as an effective strategy for stroke prevention.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the key drivers of fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the fastest growing cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. HSCs are heterogenous, and a senescent subset of HSCs is implicated in hepatic fibrosis and HCC. Administration of anti-uPAR (urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor) CAR T cells has been shown to deplete senescent HSCs and attenuate fibrosis in murine models. However, the comprehensive features of senescent HSCs in MASH, as well as their cellular ontogeny have not been characterized; hence, we aimed to comprehensively characterize and define the origin of HSCs in human and murine MASH.",

        "Abstract": "Peptide ALW (ALWPPNLHAWVP) targeting anti-dsDNA antibodies has shown promising therapeutic effects in alleviating lupus nephritis, but is potentially limited by poor stability and non-kidney targeting. We recently developed a D-form modified ALW, called D-ALW, which has the capacity to widely inhibit pathogenic polyclonal anti-dsDNA antibody reactions. Further modification of D-ALW using PEG-PLGA nanoparticles to enhance good kidney-targeting ability and extend half-life. Here, we demonstrate that the D-form modified ALW maintains higher binding and inhibition efficiencies and achieves higher stability. Most importantly, D-ALW nanoparticles exhibit excellent kidney-targeting ability and prolong the half-life of the peptides in BALB/c mice. Additionally, compared to D-ALW, D-ALW nanoparticles significantly reduce the glomerular deposition of IgG and C3, improve renal histopathologies, such as glomerular proliferation and inflammatory cells infiltration, and markedly prolong lifespan in MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice. Overall, these results establish that the D-ALW nanoparticles offer synergistic benefits in both safety and efficacy, providing long-term renal preservation and treatment advantages in lupus nephritis.",

        "Title": "ST14 interacts with TMEFF1 and is a predictor of poor prognosis in ovarian cancer.",
        "Abstract": "TMEFF1 is a new protein involved in the physiological functions of the central nervous system, and we previously reported TMEFF1 can promote ovarian cancer. ST14 was determined to be involved in the processes of epidermal differentiation, epithelial cell integrity, and vascular endothelial cell migration, etc. The relationship between ST14 and TMEFF1 in the ovary remains unknown. In this study, we detected the expression of ST14 and TMEFF1 in 130 different ovarian cancer tissues through immunohistochemistry. We determined ST14 and TMEFF1 were highly expressed in ovarian cancer, indicating a higher degree of tumor malignancy and a worse prognosis. Tissues significantly expressing ST14 also highly expressed TMEFF1, and the expression of the two proteins was positively correlated. Consistently, immunofluorescence double staining demonstrated the co-localization of ST14 and TMEFF1 in the same region, and immunoprecipitation confirmed the interaction between ST14 and TMEFF1. TMEFF1 expression was also reduced after knocking down ST14 through Western blot. MTT, wound healing and Transwell assays results determined that knockdown of ST14 inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells in vitro, but the inhibitory effect was restored after adding TMEFF1 exogenous protein. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways analysis showed that ST14 and its related genes were enriched in the processes of epithelial formation, intercellular adhesion, protein localization, and mitosis regulation. We also clarified the kinase, microRNA, and transcription factor target networks and the impact of genetic mutations on prognosis. Overall, high expression of ST14 and TMEFF1 in ovarian cancer predicts higher tumor malignancy and a worse prognosis. ST14 and TMEFF1 co-localize and interact with each other in ovarian cancer. ST14 can regulate TMEFF1 expression to promote proliferation, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells. We speculate that the relationship between ST14 and TMEFF1 in ovarian cancer could become a potential target for anti-cancer therapy.",

However, they still suffer from complex processing, poor mechanical properties, and flammability. As an agricultural waste, bagasse is rich in cellulose, which has attracted much attention. Inspired by the fact that borate ions can effectively enhance the strength of plant tissue by their cross-linking with polysaccharides, the present work designs and fabricates a series of multifunctional bagasse foams with robust strength and improved thermal insulation and flame retardancy ",

        "Abstract": "Conductive hydrogel sensors have attracted attention for use in human motion monitoring detection, but integrating excellent biocompatibility, mechanical, self-adhesive, and self-healing properties, and high sensitivity into a hydrogel remains a challenge. In this work, a novel multifunctional conductive particle was designed and added to a polyacrylamide (PAM) matrix to prepare the hydrogel. It is worth noting that with the addition of polydopamine@poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PDA@PEDOT), the PAM/PDA@PEDOT hydrogel (PAPP hydrogel) showed excellent mechanical properties and high adhesion strength on different substrate surfaces. Meanwhile, the PAPP hydrogel shows outstanding self-healing properties, the mechanical properties of PAPP hydrogel broken from the middle recovered 92% tensile strength and 95% elongation at break after 12 h, respectively. Furthermore, assembled as strain wireless sensors, the PAPP sensor displays high sensitivity, where the gauge factor (GF) is 2.82, which can be used to accurately detect human facial micro-expressions and movements. Overall, the PAPP hydrogel with excellent mechanical, self-adhesive, and self-healing properties, and high sensitivity, demonstrated promise for use in wearable devices and bionic skins.",

        "Abstract": "The relationship between remnant cholesterol (RC) and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in the context of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) remains an area of ambiguity. This investigation was designed to elucidate the potential association between RC and HOMA-IR in a cohort of American adults diagnosed with MAFLD. Data from 5533 participants were procured from the 2017-2018 US National Health and Nutrition Examination (NHANES) databases. A weighted linear regression model was employed to analyze the association between RC and HOMA-IR in the context of MAFLD. Preliminary analysis revealed that 44.67% of the participants were diagnosed with MAFLD, with a higher prevalence observed in individuals aged 50-64\u00a0years (31.84%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and in males compared to females (53.48% vs. 46.52%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). A positive correlation was identified between RC and HOMA-IR in MAFLD patients. The threshold effect analysis model indicated a breakpoint at RC\u2009=\u200930\u00a0mg/dl, with a more pronounced positive correlation when RC\u2009<\u200930\u00a0mg/dl (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.17, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis further demonstrated that among all lipid parameters, RC exhibited the largest area under the curve. The study findings suggest a positive correlation between RC and HOMA-IR in MAFLD patients, indicating that elevated RC may serve as an independent risk factor for MAFLD.",

        "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays a key role in regulating cancer development. LncRNA deoxyguanosine kinase antisense RNA 1 (DGUOK-AS1) has been reported as a promoter in tumor. The work was designed to further investigate the mechanism of action of DGUOK-AS1 in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). DGUOK-AS1 level in LUSC cells was measured using RT-qPCR. Counting Kit-8 assays and colony forming assays were performed to evaluate LUSC cell viability and proliferation. Transwell assays were performed to detect cell migration and invasion. Luciferase reporter and RNA pulldown assays were used to verify the binding capacity of DGUOK-AS1 and miR-653-5p. RNA immunoprecipitation assays were performed to verify the relationship of DGUOK-AS1, miR-653-5p, and SLC6A15. DGUOK-AS1 was highly expressed in LUSC cells. DGUOK-AS1 knockdown suppressed LUSC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. SLC6A15 was demonstrated to be targeted by miR-653-5p, and DGUOK-AS1 interacted with miR-653-5p to modulate SLC6A15 level in LUSC cells. Overexpression of SLC6A15 reversed the suppressive effects of DGUOK-AS1 knockdown on LUSC cell processes. In conclusion,\u00a0DGUOK-AS1 promotes malignant behaviors of LUSC cells by upregulating SLC6A15 level through interaction with miR-653-5p.",

        "Abstract": "Liver injuries often occur in a zonated manner. However, detailed regenerative responses to such zonal injuries at cellular and molecular levels remain largely elusive. By using a fate-mapping strain, Cyp2e1-DreER, to elucidate liver regeneration after acute pericentral injury, we found that pericentral regeneration is primarily compensated by the expansion of remaining pericentral hepatocytes, and secondarily by expansion of periportal hepatocytes. Employing single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, immunostaining, and in\u00a0vivo functional assays, we demonstrated that the upregulated expression of the mTOR/4E-BP1 axis and lactate dehydrogenase A in hepatocytes contributes to pericentral regeneration, while activation of transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b21) signaling in the damaged area mediates fibrotic responses and inhibits hepatocyte proliferation. Inhibiting the pericentral accumulation of monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages through an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide-based strategy attenuates these cell-derived TGF-\u03b21 signalings, thus improving pericentral regeneration. Our study provides integrated and high-resolution spatiotemporal insights into the cellular and molecular basis of pericentral regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have attracted extensive attention in tumor immunotherapy. Targeting immune cells in cancer therapy has become a strategy of great research interest. mRNA vaccines are a potential choice for tumor immunotherapy, due to their ability to directly encode antigen proteins and stimulate a strong immune response. However, the mode of delivery and lack of stability of mRNA are key issues limiting its application. LNPs are an excellent mRNA delivery carrier, and their structural stability and biocompatibility make them an effective means for delivering mRNA to specific targets. This study summarizes the research progress in LNP delivery carrier-assisted targeted controlled release mRNA vaccines in tumor immunity. The role of LNPs in improving mRNA stability, immunogenicity, and targeting is discussed. This review aims to systematically summarize the latest research progress in LNP delivery carrier-assisted targeted controlled release mRNA vaccines in tumor immunity to provide new ideas and strategies for tumor immunotherapy, as well as to provide more effective treatment plans for patients.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate identification and localization of multiple abnormalities are crucial steps in the interpretation of chest X-rays (CXRs); however, the lack of a large CXR dataset with bounding boxes severely constrains accurate localization research based on deep learning. We created a large CXR dataset named CXR-AL14, containing 165,988 CXRs and 253,844 bounding boxes. On the basis of this dataset, a deep-learning-based framework was developed to identify and localize 14 common abnormalities and calculate the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) simultaneously. The mean average precision values obtained by the model for 14 abnormalities reached 0.572-0.631 with an intersection-over-union threshold of 0.5, and the intraclass correlation coefficient of the CTR algorithm exceeded 0.95 on the held-out, multicentre and prospective test datasets. This framework shows an excellent performance, good generalization ability and strong clinical applicability, which is superior to senior radiologists and suitable for routine clinical settings.",

        "Abstract": "Aggression is an instinctive behavior that has been reported to be influenced by early-life stress. However, the potential effects of acute stress during the postweaning period, a key stage for brain development, on defensive aggression and the associated mechanism remain poorly understood. In the present study, aggressive behaviors were evaluated in adolescent mice exposed to postweaning stress. Serum corticosterone and testosterone levels, neural dendritic spine density, and gut microbiota composition were determined to identify the underlying mechanism. Behavioral analysis showed that postweaning stress reduced locomotor activity in mice and decreased defensive aggression in male mice. ELISA results showed that postweaning stress reduced serum testosterone levels in female mice. Golgi staining analysis demonstrated that postweaning stress decreased neural dendritic spine density in the medial prefrontal cortex of male mice. 16S rRNA sequencing results indicated that postweaning stress altered the composition of the gut microbiota in male mice. Combined, these results suggested that postweaning stress alters defensive aggression in male mice, which may be due to changes in neuronal structure as well as gut microbiota composition. Our findings highlight the long-lasting and sex-dependent effects of early-life experience on behaviors.",

        "Abstract": "The ILAE Neuroimaging Task Force publishes educational case reports that highlight basic aspects of neuroimaging in epilepsy consistent with the ILAE's educational mission. Subcortical laminar heterotopia, also known as subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) or \"double cortex,\" is an intriguing and rare congenital malformation of cortical development. SBH lesions are part of a continuum best designated as agyria-pachygyria-band-spectrum. The malformation is associated with epilepsy that is often refractory, as well as variable degrees of developmental delay. Moreover, in an increasing proportion of cases, a distinct molecular-genetic background can be found. Diagnosing SBH can be a major challenge for many reasons, including more subtle lesions, and \"non-classic\" or unusual MRI-appearances. By presenting an illustrative case, we address the challenges and needs of diagnosing and treating SBH patients in epilepsy, especially the value of high-resolution imaging and specialized MRI-protocols.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer treatment might cause heart failure and deteriorate the patients' quality of life. Despite the wide use of conventional echocardiography, it often fails to detect cardiotoxicity until advanced cardiac dysfunction at potentially irreversible stages. Advanced techniques, such as three-dimensional imaging and strain analysis in stress echocardiography, have shown promise in identifying cardiotoxicity at subclinical stages, even when traditional measures remain within normal ranges. These novel techniques have been shown to identify cardiac impairment in 30%-50% of the patients undergoing potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy, which allows for early intervention and enhanced patient management. Although professional societies are advocating for the inclusion of these techniques into routine monitoring protocols, more research is needed to optimize and standardize their use across various centers and chemotherapeutic agents. This review explores the role of stress echocardiography in the early detection and monitoring of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. It delves into current knowledge and emerging research, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding and to highlight areas worthy of further investigation.",

        "Title": "The uptake and degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls in constructed wetlands planted with Myriophyllum aquaticum.",
        "Abstract": "The unregulated dismantling and improper disposal of electronic waste lead to severe soil contamination by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Constructed wetlands (CWs) play an important role in PCBs removal as a result of the co-existence of anaerobic and aerobic conditions. However, the effects and mechanisms of different PCBs\u00a0concentrations\u00a0in soils on plant uptake and PCBs\u00a0degradation\u00a0within CWs are unclear. We evaluated the uptake and degradation of PCBs at different concentrations by Myriophyllum aquaticum (Vell.) Verdc. Planting significantly increased PCBs removal by 8.70% (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in soils with 1500 and 2500\u00a0\u03bcg/kg PCBs, whereas no significant effect was observed at 500 and 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/kg. PCBs levels did not significantly affect plant growth and PCBs accumulation. The contribution of plant uptake to PCBs removal was only 0.10-0.12%, indicating that microbial degradation was the dominant pathway for PCBs removal after planting with M. aquaticum. In the treatments with PCBs\u2009\u2265\u20091500\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, M. aquaticum increased the microbial population, altered the microbial community structure and enriched PCB-degrading bacteria. Functional prediction revealed that microbes in M. aquaticum rhizosphere secreted more peroxidase and glycosyltransferase than non-plant control, which were likely involved in PCBs metabolism.",

Currently researchers focus on the doping ability and doping distribution in monolayer TMD and have obtained a series of achievements. Bilayer TMD has more excellent properties compared with monolayer TMD. Moreover, bilayer TMD with different stacking structures presents varying performance due to the difference in interlayer coupling. Herein, this work focuses on doping ability of dopants in different bilayer stacking structures that has not been studied yet. Results of this work show that the doping ability of V atoms in bilayer AA' and AB stacked WS",

Although the prevalence of NAFLD is continuously rising, effective medical treatments are still inadequate. Radix Polygoni Multiflori (RPM) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine. As a processed product of RPM, prepared Radix Polygoni Multiflori (PRPM) has been reported to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This study investigated whether PRPM treatment could significantly improve NAFLD. We used recent literature, the Herb database and the SwissADME database to isolate the active compounds of PRPM. The OMIM, DisGeNET and GeneCards databases were used to isolate NAFLD-related target genes, and GO functional enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were conducted. Moreover, PRPM treatment in NAFLD model mice was evaluated. The results indicate that the target genes are mainly enriched in the AMPK and ",

        "Abstract": "A challenge to many real-world data streams is imbalance with concept drift, which is one of the most critical tasks in anomaly detection. Learning nonstationary data streams for anomaly detection has been well studied in recent years. However, most of the researches assume that the class of data streams is relatively balanced. Only a few approaches tackle the joint issue of imbalance and concept drift. To overcome this joint issue, we propose an ensemble learning method with generative adversarial network-based sampling and consistency check (EGSCC) in this paper. First, we design a comprehensive anomaly detection framework that includes an oversampling module by generative adversarial network, an ensemble classifier, and a consistency check module. Next, we introduce double encoders into GAN to better capture the distribution characteristics of imbalanced data for oversampling. Then, we apply the stacking ensemble learning to deal with concept drift. Four base classifiers of SVM, KNN, DT and RF are used in the first layer, and LR is used as meta classifier in second layer. Last but not least, we take consistency check of the incremental instance and check set to determine whether it is anormal by statistical learning, instead of threshold-based method. And the validation set is dynamic updated according to the consistency check result. Finally, three artificial data sets obtained from Massive Online Analysis platform and two real data sets are used to verify the performance of the proposed method from four aspects: detection performance, parameter sensitivity, algorithm cost and anti-noise ability. Experimental results show that the proposed method has significant advantages in anomaly detection of imbalanced data streams with concept drift.",

        "Abstract": "Sen1 is an essential helicase for factor-dependent transcription termination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose molecular-motor mechanism has not been well addressed. Here, we use single-molecule experimentation to better understand the molecular-motor determinants of its action on RNA polymerase II (Pol II) complex. We quantify Sen1 translocation activity on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), finding elevated translocation rates, high levels of processivity and ATP affinities. Upon deleting the N- and C-terminal domains, or further deleting different parts of the prong subdomain, which is an essential element for transcription termination, Sen1 displays changes in its translocation properties, such as slightly reduced translocation processivities, enhanced translocation rates and statistically identical ATP affinities. Although these parameters fulfil the requirements for Sen1 translocating along the RNA transcript to catch up with a stalled Pol II complex, we observe significant reductions in the termination efficiencies as well as the factions of the formation of the previously described topological intermediate prior to termination, suggesting that the prong may preserve an interaction with Pol II complex during factor-dependent termination. Our results underscore a more detailed rho-like mechanism of Sen1 and a critical interaction between Sen1 and Pol II complex for factor-dependent transcription termination in eukaryotes.",

        "Abstract": "Anomaly detection is a highly important task in the field of data analysis. Traditional anomaly detection approaches often strongly depend on data size, structure and features, while introducing the idea of ensemble into anomaly detection can greatly improve the generalization ability. Ensemble-based anomaly detection methods still face some challenges, however, such as data imbalance, time and space demand and the selection of base detectors. To this end, we propose a selective ensemble method for anomaly detection based on parallel learning (SEAD-PL). First, a differentiated stratified sampling method is designed to alleviate the problem of data imbalance. Then, a distributed parallel training frame is built to address the problem of excessive time and space consumption for base detector training. Finally, a clustering-based ensemble selection strategy is introduced to balance the accuracy and diversity of base detectors. Experiments are performed on six datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed method has obvious advantages over four selected methods.",

However, the nature of large, sparse scRNA-seq datasets and privacy regulations present challenges for efficient cell identification. Federated learning provides a solution, allowing efficient and private data use. Here, we introduce scFed, a unified federated learning framework that allows for benchmarking of four classification algorithms without violating data privacy, including single-cell-specific and general-purpose classifiers. We evaluated scFed using eight publicly available scRNA-seq datasets with diverse sizes, species and technologies, assessing its performance via intra-dataset and inter-dataset experimental setups. We find that scFed performs well on a variety of datasets with competitive accuracy to centralized models. Though Transformer-based model excels in centralized training, its performance slightly lags behind single-cell-specific model within the scFed framework, coupled with a notable time complexity concern. Our study not only helps select suitable cell identification methods but also highlights federated learning's potential for privacy-preserving, collaborative biomedical research.",

        "Title": "Widespread slow oscillations support interictal epileptiform discharge networks in focal epilepsy.",
        "Abstract": "Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) often co-occur across spatially-separated cortical regions, forming IED networks. However, the factors prompting IED propagation remain unelucidated. We hypothesized that slow oscillations (SOs) might facilitate IED propagation. Here, the amplitude and phase synchronization of SOs preceding propagating and non-propagating IEDs were compared in 22 patients with focal epilepsy undergoing intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation. Intracranial channels were categorized into the irritative zone (IZ) and normal zone (NOZ) regarding the presence of IEDs. During wakefulness, we found that pre-IED SOs within the IZ exhibited higher amplitudes for propagating IEDs than non-propagating IEDs (delta band: p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, theta band: p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). This increase in SOs was also concurrently observed in the NOZ (delta band: p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Similarly, the inter-channel phase synchronization of SOs prior to propagating IEDs was higher than those preceding non-propagating IEDs in the IZ (delta band: p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Through sliding window analysis, we observed that SOs preceding propagating IEDs progressively increased in amplitude and phase synchronization, while those preceding non-propagating IEDs remained relatively stable. Significant differences in amplitude occurred approximately 1150\u00a0ms before IEDs. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, SOs on scalp recordings also showed higher amplitudes before intracranial propagating IEDs than before non-propagating IEDs (delta band: p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Furthermore, the analysis of IED density around sleep SOs revealed that only high-amplitude sleep SOs demonstrated correlation with IED propagation. Overall, our study highlights that transient but widely distributed SOs are associated with IED propagation as well as generation in focal epilepsy during sleep and wakefulness, providing new insight into the EEG substrate supporting IED networks.",

        "Abstract": "Living cell-mediated nanodelivery system is considered a promising candidate for targeted antitumor therapy; however, their use is restricted by the adverse interactions between carrier cells and nanocargos. Herein, a novel erythrocyte-based nanodelivery system is developed by assembling renal-clearable copper sulfide (CuS) nanodots on the outer membranes of erythrocytes via a lipid fusion approach, and demonstrate that it is an efficient photothermal platform against hepatocellular carcinoma. After intravenous injection of the nanodelivery system, CuS nanodots assembled on erythrocytes can be released from the system, accumulate in tumors in response to the high shear stress of bloodstream, and show excellent photothermal antitumor effect under the near infrared laser irradiation. Therefore, the erythrocyte-mediated nanodelivery system holds many advantages including prolonged blood circulation duration and enhanced tumor accumulation. Significantly, the elimination half-life of the nanodelivery system is 74.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.77\u00a0h, which is much longer than that of nanodots (33.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.36\u00a0h). Moreover, the other two kinds of nanodots can be well assembled onto erythrocytes to produce other erythrocyte-based hitchhiking platforms. Together, the findings promote not only the development of novel erythrocyte-based nanodelivery systems as potential platforms for tumor treatment but also their further clinical translation toward personalized healthcare.",

        "Abstract": "Donor-acceptor (D-A) molecules have drawn massive attention recently in the design of high-performance materials, but the underlying reasons for the magic abilities of D-A architecture in building very different organic semiconductors are still unclear. Here, based on a series of experimentally bipolar host and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules with the same donor but different acceptor units, it was found that TADF emitters have more effective charge transfer between donor and acceptor units than bipolar host molecules. More efficient conjugation effects between the donor and acceptor units of host materials were identified from the lower dihedral angles of the D-A structure, smaller and even negative charge transfer amount, shorter charge-transfer length, and larger hole-electron overlap extent. These findings with in-depth insights into different interaction models of donor and acceptor units shed important light on the molecular design of TADF emitters and bipolar materials in a D-A architecture.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, a genomic approach was employed to evaluate the metabolic potentials and taxonomic classification of the halophilic genus Halarchaeum. Genomic analysis revealed that Halarchaeum members exhibit a predilection for amino acids as their primary energy source in high-salinity environments over carbohydrates. Genome analysis unveiled the presence of crucial genes associated with metabolic pathways, including the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, semi-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway, and the urea cycle. Furthermore, the genomic analysis indicated that Halarchaeum members employ diverse mechanisms for osmotic regulation (encompassing both salt-in and salt-out strategies). Halarchaeum members also encode genes to alleviate acid and heat stress. The average nucleotide identity value between Halarchaeum solikamskense and Halarchaeum nitratireducens exceeded the established threshold (95%-96%) for defining distinct species. This high similarity suggests a close relationship between these two species, prompting the proposal to reclassify Halarchaeum solikamskense as a heterotypic synonym of Halarchaeum nitratireducens. The results of this study contribute to our knowledge of taxonomic classification and shed light on the adaptive strategies employed by Halarchaeum species in their specific ecological niches.",

        "Abstract": "Sweat has emerged as a compelling analyte for noninvasive biosensing technology because it contains a wealth of important biomarkers in hormones, organic biomacromolecules, and various ionic mixtures. These components offer valuable insights and can reflect an individual's physiological conditions. Here, we introduced an explainable deep learning (DL)-assisted wearable self-calibrating colorimetric biosensing analysis platform to efficiently and precisely detect the biomarker's concentration in sweat. Specifically, we have integrated the advantages of the colorimetric sensing method, adsorbing-swelling hydrogel, and explainable DL algorithms to develop an enzyme/indicator-immobilized colorimetric patch, which has reliable colorimetric sensing ability and excellent adsorbing-swelling function. A total of 5625 colorimetric images were collected as the analysis data set and assessed two DL algorithms and seven machine learning (ML) algorithms. Zn",

        "Abstract": "Cyanophyta has the potential to produce biocrude via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). However, aqueous phase products (APs), as by-products of HTL, pose a risk of eutrophication for the high levels of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) can efficiently convert organics into small molecules, offering a technique for the harmless treatment of APs. Effects of holding time, pressure, and moisture content on the biocrude yields from isothermal HTL (300\u00a0\u00b0C) and fast HTL (salt bath temperature of 500\u00a0\u00b0C) were comprehensively investigated. Biocrude properties were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR and GC-MS. Subsequently, the APs obtained under the conditions producing the highest biocrude yield were subjected to SCWO at 550\u00a0\u00b0C with different oxidation coefficients (n) from 0 to 2.

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of sporotrichosis and identify possible novel therapeutic targets. Total RNA was extracted from skin lesion samples from sporotrichosis patients and used to construct a long-chain RNA transcriptome library and miRNA transcriptome library for whole transcriptome sequencing. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the groups were identified, and then Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis enrichment analyses were performed based on the DEGs. An lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network was constructed. The expressions of JAK/STAT pathway-related proteins were detected in the patient and control tissues using RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly enriched in various infectious diseases and immune response-related signaling pathways. Competing endogenous RNA network analysis was performed and identified the hub lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs. Compared with the control group, the mRNA expressions of SOCS3, IL-6, and JAK3 were significantly upregulated, while the expression of STAT3 did not change significantly. Also, the protein expressions of SOCS3, IL-6, JAK3, and STAT3, as well as phosphorylated JAK3 and STAT3, were significantly upregulated. We identified 671 lncRNA DEGs, 3281 mRNA DEGs, and 214 miRNA DEGs to be involved in Sporothrix globosa infection. The study findings suggest that the JAK/STAT pathway may be a therapeutic target for sporotrichosis.",

        "Abstract": "This work developed an optofluidic immunochip that uses whispering gallery mode with fiber laser enhancement, for the rapid detection of a key biomarker cardiac troponin I for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The immunochip adopted an innovative design, using perforated hollow glass microspheres (HGMS) as carriers, with antibodies immobilized on the inner surface of the HGMS, thereby achieving ultra-low sample consumption. The performance of the immunochip was improved by fiber laser, including spectral width compression to 0.019\u00a0nm, optical signal-to-noise ratio amplification to 63.17\u00a0dB, and an enhancement in the limit of detection to 5\u00a0pg/mL. Moreover, this immunochip can provide results within 15\u00a0min, making it highly suitable for early AMI risk management. Compared to the standard electrochemiluminescence detection method, although some differences exist in the results of the immunochip due to the principle of detection and differences in antibody affinity, its positive reference value can be calculated as 0.0754\u00a0ng/mL, with a successful recognition rate of 88% for positive patients. The immunosensor is integrated on a polydimethylsiloxane substrate, with a compact size suitable for use in point-of-care devices and AMI self-screening, as well as rapid disease screening and microanalysis of various biomarkers, offering new possibilities for applications in these fields.",

The myriad of microorganisms present in the intestinal tract exhibits highly intricate interactions, which play a crucial role in maintaining the stability and balance of the gut microbial ecosystem. These interactions, in turn, influence the overall health of the host. The mammalian gut microbes have evolved a wide range of mechanisms to suppress or even eliminate their competitors for nutrients and space. Simultaneously, extensive cooperative interactions exist among different microbes to optimize resource utilization and enhance their own fitness. This review will focus on the competitive mechanisms among members of the gut microorganisms and discuss key modes of actions, including bacterial secretion systems, bacteriocins, membrane vesicles (MVs) ",

        "Abstract": "Autochthonous bioaugmentation and nutrient biostimulation are promising bioremediation methods for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in contaminated agricultural soils, but little is known about their combined working mechanism. In this study, a microcosm trial was conducted to explore the combined mechanism of autochthonous fungal bioaugmentation and ammonium nitrogen biostimulation, using DNA stable-isotope-probing (DNA-SIP) and microbial network analysis. Both treatments significantly improved phenanthrene (PHE) removal, with their combined application producing the best results. The microbial community composition was notably altered by all bioremediation treatments, particularly the PHE-degrading bacterial and fungal taxa. Fungal bioaugmentation removed PAHs through extracellular enzyme secretion but reduced soil microbial diversity and ecological stability, while nitrogen biostimulation promoted PAH dissipation by stimulating indigenous soil degrading microbes, including fungi and key bacteria in the soil co-occurrence networks, ensuring the ecological diversity of soil microorganisms. The combination of both approaches proved to be the most effective strategy, maintaining a high degradation efficiency and relatively stable soil biodiversity through the secretion of lignin hydrolytic enzymes by fungi, and stimulating the reproduction of soil native degrading microbes, especially the key degraders in the co-occurrence networks. Our findings provide a fresh perspective of the synergy between fungal bioaugmentation and nitrogen biostimulation, highlighting the potential of this combined bioremediation approach for in situ PAH-contaminated soils.",

Methods Kunming mice were randomly divided into a blank group(0.8 mL/day saline by gavage) and a DSS modeling group. After modeling, the DSS modeling group was further divided into a control group (0.8 mL/day saline), a salazosulfapyridine (SASP) treated group(430 mg/(kg.d)) and a mare's milk group(0.8 mL/day), with 16 mice in each group. After 10 days of gavage administration, HE staining was performed to observe colonic inflammation, and the disease activity index (DAI) and colonic mucosal damage index (CMDI) were scored. ELISA was used to determine the levels of interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, and IL-10 in mouse colonic tissues, and flow cytometry was used to detect the percentages of CD4",

        "Abstract": "Dentine is a major component of teeth and is responsible for many of their functions, such as mastication and neural sensation/transduction. Over the past decades, numerous studies have focused on dentine development and regeneration using a variety of research models, including in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro models. In vivo animal models play a crucial role in the exploration of biochemical factors that are involved in dentine development, whereas ex vivo and in vitro models contribute mainly to the identification of biophysical factors in dentine regeneration, of which mechanical force is most critical. In the present review, research models involved in studies related to dentine development and regeneration were screened from publications released in recent years and summarised comprehensively, particularly in vivo animal models including prokaryotic microinjection, Cre/LoxP, CRISPR/Cas9, ZFN and TALEN, and scaffold-based in vitro and ex vivo models. The latter were further divided by the interactive forces. Summarising these research models will not only benefit the development of future dentine-related studies but also provide hints regarding the evolution of novel dentine regeneration strategies.",

        "Title": "Controlling Silicification on DNA Origami with Polynucleotide Brushes.",
        "Abstract": "DNA origami has been used as biotemplates for growing a range of inorganic materials to create novel organic-inorganic hybrid nanomaterials. Recently, the solution-based silicification of DNA has been used to grow thin silica shells on DNA origami. However, the silicification reaction is sensitive to the reaction conditions and often results in uncontrolled DNA origami aggregation, especially when growth of thicker silica layers is desired. Here, we investigated how site-specifically placed polynucleotide brushes influence the silicification of DNA origami. Our experiments showed that long DNA brushes, in the form of single- or double-stranded DNA, significantly suppress the aggregation of DNA origami during the silicification process. Furthermore, we found that double-stranded DNA brushes selectively promote silica growth on DNA origami surfaces. These observations were supported and explained by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. This work provides new insights into our understanding of the silicification process on DNA and provides a powerful toolset for the development of novel DNA-based organic-inorganic nanomaterials.",

        "Title": "Endometrial stromal cell autophagy-dependent ferroptosis caused by iron overload in ovarian endometriosis is inhibited by the ATF4-xCT pathway.",
        "Abstract": "Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death process characterized by the accumulation of lethal oxidative damage. Localized iron overload is a unique clinical phenomenon in ovarian endometriosis (EM). However, the role and mechanism of ferroptosis in the course of ovarian EM remain unclear. Traditionally, autophagy promotes cell survival. However, a growing body of research suggests that autophagy promotes ferroptosis under certain conditions. This study aimed to clarify the status of ferroptosis in ovarian EM and explore the mechanism(s) by which iron overload causes ferroptosis and ectopic endometrial resistance to ferroptosis in human. The results showed increased levels of iron and reactive oxygen species in ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). Some ferroptosis and autophagy proteins in the ectopic tissues differed from those in the eutopic endometrium. In vitro, iron overload caused decreased cellular activity, increased lipid peroxidation levels, and mitochondrial morphological changes, whereas ferroptosis inhibitors alleviated these phenomena, illustrating activated ferroptosis. Iron overload increased autophagy, and ferroptosis caused by iron overload was inhibited by autophagy inhibitors, indicating that ferroptosis caused by iron overload was autophagy-dependent. We also confirmed the effect of iron overload and autophagy on lesion growth in vivo by constructing a mouse EM model; the results were consistent with those of the in vitro experiments of human tissue and endometrial stomal cells. However, ectopic lesions in patients can resist ferroptosis caused by iron overload, which can promote cystine/glutamate transporter hyperexpression by highly expressing activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). In summary, local iron overload in ovarian EM can activate autophagy-related ferroptosis in ESCs, and ectopic lesions grow in a high-iron environment via ATF4-xCT while resisting ferroptosis. The effects of iron overload on other cells in the EM environment require further study. This study deepens our understanding of the role of ferroptosis in ovarian EM.",

        "Abstract": "The spread of many infectious diseases relies on aerosol transmission to the respiratory tract. Here we design an intranasal mask comprising a positively-charged thermosensitive hydrogel and cell-derived micro-sized vesicles with a specific\u00a0viral receptor. We show that the positively charged hydrogel intercepts negatively charged viral aerosols, while the viral receptor on vesicles mediates the entrapment of viruses for inactivation. We demonstrate that when displaying matched viral receptors, the intranasal masks protect the nasal cavity and lung of mice from either severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or influenza A virus. With computerized tomography images of human nasal cavity, we further conduct computational fluid dynamics simulation and three-dimensional printing of an anatomically accurate human nasal cavity, which is connected to human lung organoids to generate a human respiratory tract model. Both simulative and experimental results support the suitability of intranasal masks in humans, as the likelihood of viral respiratory infections induced by different variant strains is dramatically reduced.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with chronic pain commonly report impaired memory. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that inhibition of neurogenesis by neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in chronic pain-associated memory impairments. There is currently a lack of treatment strategies for this condition. An increasing number of clinical trials have reported the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory therapies targeting tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) for inflammatory diseases. The present study investigated whether infliximab alleviates chronic pain-associated memory impairments in rats with chronic constriction injury (CCI). We demonstrated that infliximab alleviated spatial memory impairment and hyperalgesia induced by CCI. Furthermore, infliximab inhibited the activation of hippocampal astrocytes and microglia and decreased the release of proinflammatory cytokines in CCI rats. Furthermore, infliximab reversed the decrease in the numbers of newborn neurons and mature neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) caused by chronic pain. Our data provide evidence that infliximab alleviates chronic pain-associated memory impairments, suppresses neuroinflammation and restores hippocampal neurogenesis in a CCI model. These facts indicate that infliximab may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of chronic pain and associated memory impairments.",

        "Abstract": "It is of great significance to develop efficient methods for preparing high-content modified nanoscale lead azide (LA) composites used in microinitiating devices. In this work, a structurally controllable salicylate-intercalated lead hydroxide with a nanoscale mesoporous structure is designed. Using it as a precursor, carbon-based lead azide (LA/C) and salicylate-based lead azide (LA/SA) are fabricated by the gas-solid azidation of the framework (GAF) method within 3 h, greatly reducing the preparation time of nano-LA composites. The characterizations of the composites demonstrate that the Pb in the precursors is transformed into nanoscale LA attached to the salicylate radical or its carbonized skeleton. Due to the unique embedded nanostructures and excellent electrical and thermal conductivity of salicylate-derived carbon materials, LA/C exhibits excellent electrostatic safety (",

        "Abstract": "Aerobic fitness is a critical aspect of overall health and well-being, essential for maintaining a high quality of life. Unfortunately, sedentary behavior has been on the rise among young adults, and this has had a negative impact on their aerobic fitness levels. Therefore, it is crucial to identify enjoyable physical exercise training programs that can play a pivotal role in improving aerobic fitness. The objective of this study was to systematically review the experimental studies concerning the impact of small-sided games (SSGs) training programs, implemented across various team sports, on the enhancement of aerobic fitness in a youth sedentary population. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science on August 01, 2023. Our eligibility criteria focused on studies involving sedentary youth populations (aged <18 years) as the target population. These studies needed to incorporate interventions based on SSGs as the intervention of interest, comparing them to passive or control groups as the comparator. The primary outcomes of interest were related to maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), assessed either directly or indirectly, or the results of field-based cardiorespiratory tests. We specifically considered two- or multi-arm randomized controlled studies as the study design of interest. Out of the initial pool of 1980 studies, we reviewed 38 full-text articles, ultimately selecting and analyzing 13 studies for inclusion in our review. Among the studies included, a total of 1281 participants were enrolled in SSG-based interventions, while 744 participants acted as part of the control groups. Regarding the impact on VO2max, the six studies that investigated this outcome showed varying improvements, ranging from 2.2\u00a0% to 31.3\u00a0% when participants were exposed to SSGs. In terms of the outcome related to endurance performance in field-based tests, the eight studies that examined this aspect found that participants exposed to SSGs showed improvements ranging from 0.1\u00a0% to 79.8\u00a0%. In conclusion, this systematic review suggests that SSG-based interventions conducted among sedentary youth populations can play a positive role in improving their aerobic fitness. This improvement in aerobic fitness can have potential positive impacts on their overall health and quality of life.",

        "Abstract": "Deuterium-based isotopic labeling is an important technique for tracking cellular metabolism with the Raman signals analysis of low-wavenumber (LW) C-D bonds and high-wavenumber (HW) C-H bonds. We propose and demonstrate a disposable ultra-miniature fiber probe to detect LW and HW coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectra for deuterated compounds simultaneously and bond-selectively sensing. The 10.78\u2005\u00b5m diameter disposable fiber probe, comprised of focusing taper as fiber probe head and time-domain walk-off eliminating fiber section with designed length, realizes wide-frequency-interval dual Stokes pulse delivering and focusing. The fiber probe enables quantitative concentration determination with resolution down to 11 mM. The chemical vibration modes of LW region C-D bonds and HW region C-H bonds of the mixture samples of organic compounds and their deuterated counterparts in a simulated cell are simultaneously excited and characterized. The CARS disposable fiber probe introduces a promising handle for in vivo biochemical detection based on isotopic labeling sensing.",

In this Letter, we report that, besides interfacial resistance, the inevitable heat leap caused by the Peltier effect is the main factor affecting the conversion efficiency of TEGs. In fact, the heat leap is proven to have an impact of approximately 10% on the conversion efficiency of common TEGs. In addition, we enhance the formula for maximum conversion efficiency with heat leap from the classical expression to allow for the prediction of the performance of advanced materials in TEGs. For the first time, the experimental data from conversion efficiency corresponds exactly to that obtained theoretically by considering both the heat leap and interfacial resistivity.",

        "Abstract": "Although cotton dressing is one of the most commonly used wound management materials, it lacks antimicrobial and healing-promoting activity. This work developed a multilayer electroactive composite cotton dressing (Ag/Zn@Cotton/Paraffin) with exudate-activated electrical stimulation and antibacterial activity by the green and sustainable magnetron-sputtering and spraying methods. The inner hydrophilic layer of the cotton dressing was magnetron sputtered with silver/zinc galvanic couple arrays (Ag/Zn), which can be activated by wound exudate, generating an electrical stimulation (ES) into the wound. The Ag/Zn@Cotton showed efficient antibacterial activities against S. aureus and E. coli. Meanwhile, the paraffin-sprayed outer surface showed excellent antibacterial adhesion rates for S. aureus (99.82\u00a0%) and E. coli (97.92\u00a0%). The in vitro cell experiments showed that the ES generated by Ag/Zn@Cotton/Paraffin increased the migration of fibroblasts, and the in vivo mouse model indicated that the Ag/Zn@Cotton/Paraffin could enhance wound healing via re-epithelialization, inflammatory inhibition, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis. MTT method and live/dead staining showed that Ag/Zn@Cotton/Paraffin had no significant cytotoxic effects. This work may shed some light on designing and fabricating multi-functional electroactive composited dressings based on traditional biomedical textiles.",

        "Title": "Active control of terahertz surface plasmonic wave excitation using electromagnetically induced transparency based graphene metasurfaces.",
        "Abstract": "Surface plasmonic waves (SPWs) that propagate at meta-dielectric interface are a good source of information carrier waves for on-chip photonic devices, where SPW excitation is one key procedure. Recently, controlling SPW excitation using metasurface methods has drawn considerable attention owing to their design flexibility, wherein achieving dynamic control is of great importance. However, most studies in the terahertz regime so far are working in a passive way or only dynamically controllable at the propagation process. In this work, an active design for controlling terahertz SPWs at the excitation process is proposed using graphene metasurfaces based on the manipulation of the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect. Large modulation depth with controllable SPW excitations is demonstrated. Our method is flexible and promising in achieving more controlling degree of freedom, which can find broadband applications in future integrated devices and systems.",

        "Title": "Insights into orbital morphological features and fracture patterns in medial and inferior wall fracture: a retrospective cohort study.",
        "Abstract": "This study investigated the orbital morphological features that lead to fractures at different sites by comparing patients with isolated inferior wall fracture (IWF) to patients with isolated medial wall fracture (MWF). This study analyzed the orbital morphologic characteristics of all orbital fracture patients who underwent orbital computed tomography (CT) scans between January 2017 and October 2022. On CT scans, the bony structures of the orbit were measured. We investigated the bilateral symmetry of orbital. In addition, orbital morphological differences were compared between patients with fractures of the medial wall and those with fractures of the inferior wall. A total of 135 patients with orbital fractures were included in the study. Of these, 91 were isolated MWFs and 44 were isolated IWF. We confirmed the symmetry of bilateral orbits and measured the orbit of the uninjured side. No differences were found between the MWF group and the IWF group in terms of ocular prominence, horizontal orbital diameter, orbital rim angle, sagittal orbital depth, sagittal orbital depth, and angle of inferior wall inclination. The distance between the infraorbital nerve (ION) entry point and the orbital rim was significantly smaller in the inferior lateral wall fracture group than in the MWF group (11.87\u2009\u00b1\u20092.54 vs 14.90\u2009\u00b1\u20094.64, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and the percentage of type 1 ION was significantly lower in the IWF group than in the MWF group (40.9% vs 65.9%, P\u2009=\u20090.012). We demonstrated the symmetry of bilateral orbits and found that when the point where the ION enters the infraorbital canal is near the orbital rim, patients are more prone to suffering a fracture of the inferior wall after orbital trauma. It is less likely for patients with type 1 ION to suffer an IWF following an orbital fracture.",

        "Abstract": "Osteoarthritis is a worldwide prevalent disease that imposes a significant socioeconomic burden on individuals and healthcare systems. Achieving cartilage regeneration in patients with osteoarthritis remains challenging clinically. In this work, we construct a multiple hydrogen-bond crosslinked hydrogel loaded with tannic acid and Kartogenin by polyaddition reaction as a cell-free scaffold for in vivo cartilage regeneration, which features ultra-durable mechanical properties and stage-dependent drug release behavior. We demonstrate that the hydrogel can withstand 28000 loading-unloading mechanical cycles and exhibits fast shape memory at body temperature (30\u2009s) with the potential for minimally invasive surgery. We find that the hydrogel can also alleviate the inflammatory reaction and regulate oxidative stress in situ to establish a microenvironment conducive to healing. We show that the sequential release of tannic acid and Kartogenin can promote the migration of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells into the hydrogel scaffold, followed by the induction of chondrocyte differentiation, thus leading to full-thickness cartilage regeneration in vivo. This work may provide a promising solution to address the problem of cartilage regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Przevalski's partridge (Alectoris magna) is one of the birds in the genus Alectoris endemic to China. The distribution of A. magna was narrow, and it was only found in parts of the Qinghai, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces. A. magna was considered a monotypic species until it was distinguished into two subspecies. However, external morphological characteristics, rather than genetic differences or evolutionary relationships, are now commonly used as evidence of subspecies differentiation. In this study, a chromosome-level reference genome of A. magna has been constructed by combining Illumina, PacBio and Hi-C sequencing data. The 1135.01\u2009Mb\u2009A. magna genome was ultimately assembled. The genome showed 96.9% completeness (BUSCO), with a contig N50 length of 23.34\u2009Mb. The contigs were clustered and oriented on 20 chromosomes, covering approximately 99.96% of the genome assembly. Additionally, altogether 19,103 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 95.10% were functionally annotated. This high-quality genome assembly could serve as a valuable genomic resource for future research on the functional genomics, genetic protection, and interspecific hybridization of A. magna.",

Spontaneous fast ripples are always pathological, while ripples may be physiological or pathological. Distinguishing physiological from pathological ripples is important not only for designating epileptogenic brain regions, but also for investigations that study ripples in the context of memory encoding, consolidation, and recall in patients with epilepsy. Many studies have sought to identify distinguishing features between pathological and physiological ripples over the past two decades. Physiological and pathological ripples differ with respect to their spatial location, cellular mechanisms, morphology, and coupling with background electroencephalographic activity. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that differentiating between pathological and physiological ripples can improve surgical outcome prediction. In this review, we summarize the characteristics, differences, and applications of pathological and physiological HFOs and discuss strategies for their clinical translation.",

        "Abstract": "Studies have found large differences in masks use during the pandemic. We found evidence that cultural tightness explains mask use differences and this association was more robust in tight situations like subways. In Study 1, we observed 23,551 people's actual mask use in public places around China. People wore masks more in tight situations; however, differences did not extend to outdoor streets and public parks, where norms are looser. We replicated this finding using a data from 15,985 people across China. Finally, in a preregistered study we observed mask use with the removal of COVID-19 restrictions, people still wore masks more in tight situations like subways than in loose situations of parks. These findings suggest that norm tightness has a lasting association with people's health-protective behaviors, especially in tight situations. It provides insight into how different cultures might respond with future pandemics and in what situations people adopt health-protective behaviors.",

        "Abstract": "We describe and compare the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors and ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) among Puerto Rican young adults in the San Juan metro area in Puerto Rico and the South Bronx, NY. As part of the Boricua Youth Study - Health Assessment, (mean age 23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 years) objective anthropometric, blood pressure and blood samples were collected. Information on diet, physical activity and sleep were collected via surveys. Life's Essential 8 metrics were characterized as continuous with higher scores indicating more optimal CVH and categorically (80-100 scores for ideal CVH). Mean CVH score among NY participants was lower (61.9) than in PR (68.9). No participant had all ideal health metrics, 36% of participants in PR had 5 or more ideal CVH; while only 16% in NY met this criterion. The prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors was high for obesity (35% in NY, 19% in PR) and diabetes (17% NY, 20% PR). In this ethnically homogenous population, we found low levels of ideal CVH that varied across study site, suggesting differences by sociocultural context. Interventions to maintain and improve CVH across the life course, tailored to sociocultural environments, are necessary for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.",

DHWFS is a natural-experiment birth-cohort study of survivors of in-utero exposure to famine conditions caused by the German occupation of the Western Netherlands in Winter 1944-5, matched controls, and their siblings. We conducted DNA methylation analysis of blood samples collected when the survivors were aged 58 to quantify biological aging using the DunedinPACE, GrimAge, and PhenoAge epigenetic clocks. Famine survivors had faster DunedinPACE, as compared with controls. This effect was strongest among women. Results were similar for GrimAge, although effect-sizes were smaller. We observed no differences in PhenoAge between survivors and controls. Famine effects were not accounted for by blood-cell composition and were similar for individuals exposed early and later in gestation. Findings suggest in-utero undernutrition may accelerate biological aging in later life.",

        "Abstract": "Natural-experiment designs that compare survivors of in-utero famine exposure to unaffected controls suggest that in-utero undernutrition predisposes to development of obesity. However, birth rates drop dramatically during famines. Selection bias could arise if factors that contribute to obesity also protect fertility and/or fetal survival under famine conditions. We investigated this hypothesis using genetic analysis of a famine-exposed birth cohort. We genotyped participants in the Dutch Hunger Winter Families Study (DHWFS, N=950; 45% male), of whom 51% were exposed to the 1944-1945 Dutch Famine during gestation and 49% were their unexposed same-sex siblings or \"time controls\" born before or after the famine in the same hospitals. We computed body-mass index (BMI) polygenic indices (PGIs) in DHWFS participants and compared BMI PGIs between famine-exposed and control groups. Participants with higher polygenic risk had higher BMIs (Pearson r=0.42, p<0.001). However, differences between BMI PGIs of famine-exposed participants and controls were small and not statistically different from zero across specifications (Cohen's d=0.10, p>0.092). Our findings did not indicate selection bias, supporting the validity of the natural-experiment design within DHWFS. In summary, our study outlines a novel approach to explore the presence of selection bias in famine and other natural experiment studies.",

        "Abstract": "Ischemic diseases lead to considerable morbidity and mortality, yet conventional clinical treatment strategies for therapeutic angiogenesis fall short of being impactful. Despite the potential of biomaterials to deliver pro-angiogenic molecules at the infarct site to induce angiogenesis, their efficacy has been impeded by aberrant vascular activation and off-target circulation. Here, we present a semisynthetic low-molecular sulfated chitosan oligosaccharide (SCOS) that efficiently induces therapeutic arteriogenesis with a spontaneous generation of collateral circulation and blood reperfusion in rodent models of hind limb ischemia and myocardial infarction. SCOS elicits anti-inflammatory macrophages' (M\u03c6s') differentiation into perivascular M\u03c6s, which in turn directs artery formation via a cell-to-cell communication rather than secretory factor regulation. SCOS-mediated arteriogenesis requires a canonical Notch signaling pathway in M\u03c6s via the glycosylation of protein O-glucosyltransferases 2, which results in promoting arterial differentiation and tissue repair in ischemia. Thus, this highly bioactive oligosaccharide can be harnessed to direct efficiently therapeutic arteriogenesis and perfusion for the treatment of ischemic diseases.",

        "Title": "SLC25A21 downregulation promotes KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer progression by increasing glutamine anaplerosis.",
        "Abstract": "Emerging evidence shows that KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC) depends on glutamine (Gln) for survival and progression, indicating that targeting Gln metabolism may be a promising therapeutic strategy for KRAS-mutant CRC. However, the precise mechanism by which Gln metabolism reprogramming promotes and coordinates KRAS-mutant CRC progression remains to be fully investigated. Here, we discovered that solute carrier 25 member 21 (SLC25A21) expression was downregulated in KRAS-mutant CRC, and that SLC25A21 downregulation was correlated with poor survival of KRAS-mutant CRC patients. SLC25A21 depletion selectively accelerated the growth, invasion, migration, and metastasis of KRAS-mutant CRC cells in vitro and in vivo, and inhibited Gln-derived \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) efflux from mitochondria, thereby potentiating Gln replenishment, accompanied by increased GTP availability for persistent KRAS activation in KRAS-mutant CRC. The restoration of SLC25A21 expression impaired the KRAS-mutation-mediated resistance to cetuximab in KRAS-mutant CRC. Moreover, the arrested \u03b1-KG efflux that occurred in response to SLC25A21 depletion inhibited the activity of \u03b1-KG-dependent DNA demethylases, resulting in a further decrease in SLC25A21 expression. Our studies demonstrate that SLC25A21 plays a significant role as a tumor suppressor in KRAS-mutant CRC by antagonizing Gln-dependent anaplerosis to limit GTP availability for KRAS activation, which suggests potential alternative therapeutic strategies for KRAS-mutant CRC.",

        "Abstract": "On a Chinese coast of the Yellow Sea, a 15-year Spartina alterniflora invasion sequence was classified into five stages: no invasion, initial invasion, immature invasion, mature invasion, and senescing invasion. The effects of invasion on Bullacta caurina distribution were studied. The stem density and vegetation coverage, and sediment organic matter content increased after S. alterniflora invaded, whereas chlorophyll a concentration and porewater salinity decreased. The stem density and vegetation coverage, and porewater salinity were the dominant factors explaining habitat variations. The invasion stages, seasons and their interaction had significant effects on B. caurina density, and the density decreased after initial invasion stage of S. alterniflora. Here, a clumped spatial distribution pattern was detected on B. caurina population. Organic matter content and chlorophyll a concentration were distinguished for predicting B. caurina density. The hydrologic condition, food resources, temperature, and predation risk comprehensively affected B. caurina distribution after S. alterniflora invasion.",

        "Abstract": "Plant disease, a huge burden, can cause yield loss of up to 100%\u00a0and thus reduce food security. Actually, smart diagnosing diseases with plant phenomics is crucial for recovering the most yield loss, which usually requires sufficient image information. Hence, phenomics is being pursued as an independent discipline to enable the development of high-throughput phenotyping for plant disease. However, we often face challenges in sharing large-scale image data due to incompatibilities in formats and descriptions provided by different communities, limiting multidisciplinary research exploration. To this end, we build a Plant Phenomics Analysis of Disease (PlantPAD) platform with large-scale information on disease. Our platform contains 421 314 images, 63 crops\u00a0and 310 diseases. Compared to other databases, PlantPAD has extensive, well-annotated image data and in-depth disease information, and offers pre-trained deep-learning models for accurate plant disease diagnosis. PlantPAD supports various valuable applications across multiple disciplines, including intelligent disease diagnosis, disease education\u00a0and efficient disease detection and control. Through three applications of PlantPAD, we show the easy-to-use and convenient functions. PlantPAD is mainly oriented towards biologists, computer scientists, plant pathologists, farm managers\u00a0and pesticide scientists, which may easily explore multidisciplinary research to fight against plant diseases. PlantPAD is freely available at http://plantpad.samlab.cn.",

        "Abstract": "The effects of applying biochar with the same characteristics and at the same dose on the storage, composition, and underlying mechanisms of native organic carbon (n-SOC) dynamics in different ecosystems are still unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects of biochar amendment (7\u00a0years) on carbon sequestration and the n-SOC pools of woodland, lawn, and greenhouse soils. The 'water floating method' and improved 'combustion loss method' were used in this study to quantify residual biochar in soil. The results showed that after 7\u00a0years, the amount of biochar left in woodland, lawn, and greenhouse soils was 67.12\u00a0%, 87.50\u00a0%, and 88.13\u00a0% of the initial applied amount, respectively. And the n-SOC content increased approximately 2.07, 3.07, and 0.22 times, respectively, mainly due to increases in the native soil humin (n-HM) content of the soil. Biochar also increased the proportion of large aggregates in woodland and lawn soil and increased the t-SOC content of aggregates in each particle size fraction. Additionally, biochar increased the t-SOC of greenhouse soil aggregates but had no significant effect on the distribution of aggregates. The presence of biochar increased native soil easily oxidizable carbon (n-EOC) and microbial biomass carbon (n-MBC) in all three ecosystems. And increases in n-MBC in woodland and lawn soils occurred, which promoted the depletion of native soil hot water dissolvable organic carbon (n-HWOC) and increased CO",

        "Abstract": "The therapeutic benefits of many cell types involve paracrine mechanisms. Inspired by the paracrine functions of exosomes and the sustained degradation properties of microcapsules, here we report the therapeutic benefits of exosome-loaded degradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microcapsules with micrometric pores for the treatment of vitreoretinal diseases. On intravitreal injection in a mouse model of retinal ischaemia-reperfusion injury, microcapsules encapsulating mouse mesenchymal-stem-cell-derived exosomes settled in the inferior vitreous cavity, released exosomes for over one month as they underwent degradation and led to the restoration of retinal thickness to nearly that of the healthy retina. In mice and non-human primates with primed mycobacterial uveitis, intravitreally injected microcapsules loaded with exosomes from monkey regulatory T cells resulted in a substantial reduction in the levels of inflammatory cells. The exosome-encapsulating microcapsules, which can be lyophilised, may offer alternative treatment options for vitreoretinal diseases.",

        "Abstract": "We proposed an optical fiber salinity sensor with a composite Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity structure for simultaneous measurement of temperature and salinity based on microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology. The sensor contains two sensing cavities. The silicon cavity is used for temperature sensing, and the seawater cavity processed by the glass microstructure is sensitive to the refractive index of seawater for salinity sensing. At the same time, the influence of the salinity-temperature cross-sensitivity error of the seawater cavity is effectively compensated by using the temperature single parameter sensitivity characteristics of the silicon cavity. The structural design of the sensor seawater cavity includes a cross-shaped groove and a cylindrical fluid cavity. The surface hydrophilicity treatment was performed on the interior of the cavity to solve the effect of no water injection in the cavity caused by the miniaturization of the sensor. The optical path difference (OPD) demodulation method is used to demodulate the two F-P cavities with large dynamic range and high resolution. In the range of 5\u223c40\u00b0C and 5\u223c 40 \u2030, the temperature and salinity sensitivity of the sensor can reach 110.25\u2005nm/\u00b0C and 178.75\u2005nm/\u2030, respectively, and the resolution can reach 5.02\u2009\u00d7\u200910",

In this study, a multispectral endoscopic imaging system was built for capturing tissue reflection optical images in 18 bands across the wavelength range from 400 nm to 760 nm, non-invasively. The system was characterized by six tri-channel narrowband filters installed in front of the light source to achieve spectral separation and was equipped with a specially designed color CCD for achieving a speed of 24 multispectral imaging cubes per second. A method based on linear matrix inversion was proposed to calibrate the CCD spectral response overlaps, while a spectral analysis algorithm was developed for evaluating blood content and detecting tissue composition.

        "Abstract": "The accurate identification and real-time detection of obstacles have been considered the premise to ensure the safe operation of coal mine driverless electric locomotives. The harsh coal mine roadway environment leads to low detection accuracy of obstacles based on traditional detection methods such as LiDAR and machine learning, and these traditional obstacle detection methods lead to slower detection speeds due to excessive computational reasoning. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a deep learning-based ODEL-YOLOv5s detection model based on the conventional YOLOv5s. In this work, several data augmentation methods are introduced to increase the diversity of obstacle features in the dataset images. An attention mechanism is introduced to the neck of the model to improve the focus of the model on obstacle features. The three-scale prediction of the model is increased to a four-scale prediction to improve the detection ability of the model for small obstacles. We also optimize the localization loss function and non-maximum suppression method of the model to improve the regression accuracy and reduce the redundancy of the prediction boxes. The experimental results show that the mean average precision (mAP) of the proposed ODEL-YOLOv5s model is increased from 95.2 to 98.9% compared to the conventional YOLOv5s, the average precision of small obstacle rock is increased from 89.2 to 97.9%, the detection speed of the model is 60.2 FPS, and it has better detection performance compared with other detection models, which can provide technical support for obstacle identification and real-time detection of coal mine driverless electric locomotives.",

        "Abstract": "Hydrogels with flexible and stretchable properties are ideal for applications in wearable sensors. However, traditional hydrogel-based sensors suffer from high brittleness and low electrical sensitivity. In this case, to solve this dilemma, a macromolecular polyurethane crosslinking agent (PCA) was designed and prepared; after that, PCA and two-dimensional (2D) MXene nanosheets were both introduced into a covalently crosslinked network to enhance the comprehensive mechanical and electrochemical properties of the hydrogels. The macromolecular polyurethane crosslinking agent promotes high-tensile strength and highly stretchable capacity by suitable covalent crosslinking. The optimized hydrogel, which exhibited maximum tensile strength and maximum elongation at break, had results of 1.21 MPa and 644%, respectively. Two-dimensional MXene nanosheets provide hydrogel with high electrical conductivity and strain sensitivity, producing a wearable device for the continuous monitoring of human movements and facial microexpressions. This study demonstrated an efficient structure design strategy for building mechanically tough, highly stretchable, and sensitive dual-mode MXenes-based wearable sensors.",

        "Abstract": "Identification of pleiotropic variants associated with multiple phenotypic traits has received increasing attention in genetic association studies. Overlapping genetic associations from multiple traits help to detect weak genetic associations missed by single-trait analyses. Many statistical methods were developed to identify pleiotropic variants with most of them being limited to quantitative traits when pleiotropic effects on both quantitative and qualitative traits have been observed. This is a statistically challenging problem because there does not exist an appropriate multivariate distribution to model both quantitative and qualitative data together. Alternatively, meta-analysis methods can be applied, which basically integrate summary statistics of individual variants associated with either a quantitative or a qualitative trait without accounting for correlations among genetic variants.",

        "Abstract": "Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs) belong to the NET/NLZ protein family. In physiological functions, ZNF703 play significant roles in embryonic development, especially in the nervous system. As an transcription factors with zinc finger domains, abnormal regulation of the ZNF703 protein is associated with enhanced proliferation, invasion, and metastasis as well as drug resistance in many tumors, although mechanisms of action vary depending on the specific tumor microenvironment. ZNF703 lacks a nuclear localization sequence despite its function requiring nuclear DNA binding. The purpose of this review is to summarize the architecture of ZNF703, its roles in tumorigenesis, and tumor progression, as well as future oncology therapeutic prospects, which have implications for understanding tumor susceptibility and progression.",

        "Abstract": "Microalgae present a viable mechanism for purifying aquatic environments through the absorption of organic pollutants. In this paper, Chlorella protothecoides was cultured in a tetracycline environment, and biochar was added during the cultivation process. Compared with conventionally cultured Chlorella protothecoides, the addition of biochar for cultivation under a tetracycline environment increased the biomass of Chlorella protothecoides by 13.26 %. Moreover, the adsorption of tetracycline by biochar alone was not complete, but when mixed with Chlorella protothecoides, tetracycline was completely removed, which proved the biosorption of Chlorella protothecoides for low concentrations of tetracycline. Finally, the cultured Chlorella protothecoides was used further to prepare electrode materials, and it was found that the specific capacitance of the material reached 233.15F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. In this study, the use of biochar and Chlorella protothecoides to jointly adsorb tetracycline is of great significance for environmental protection and microalgae cultivation.",

        "Abstract": "Adjuvants are an indispensable component of vaccines, but there are few adjuvants for human vaccines. H2 receptor blockers, inhibiting gastric acid secretion, have immune enhancement effects. Ranitidine (RAN) is a water-soluble H2 receptor blocker, and whether it has an immune-enhancing effect is still unknown. In this study, flow cytometry, western blotting, and immunofluorescence methods were used to analyze whether RAN could activate macrophage polarization to the M1 phenotype in vivo and in vitro. Here, we found that the M1 inflammatory cytokine levels and surface markers in RAW264.7 cells were upregulated by NF-\u03baB activation, possibly through the PI3K-Akt2 signaling pathway, after RAN treatment. Endocytic function was also enhanced by feedback regulation of Akt2/GSK3\u03b2/Dynmin1 signaling. Furthermore, to evaluate the adjuvant function of RAN, we used OVA plus RAN as a vaccine to inhibit the growth of B16-OVA tumors in mice. We also found that in the RAN adjuvant group, macrophage polarization to M1, Th1 cell differentiation, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation were significantly upregulated. The tumor growth of mice was inhibited, and the survival rate of mice was significantly improved. This study provides new evidence for the mechanism by which RAN activates the immune response and is expected to provide a new strategy for the research and development of tumor vaccine adjuvants.",

Recent advances in single-cell methodologies, refined disease models, and genetic and epigenetic insights have provided a nuanced understanding of MASH fibrogenesis, with substantial cellular heterogeneity in MASH livers providing potentially targetable cell-cell interactions and behavior. Unlike fibrogenesis, mechanisms underlying fibrosis regression in MASH are still inadequately understood, although antifibrotic targets have been recently identified. A refined antifibrotic treatment framework could lead to noninvasive assessment and targeted therapies that preserve hepatocellular function and restore the liver's architectural integrity.",

Activation of leptin signaling in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) enhances respiratory drive. In this study, we investigated how medullary leptin signaling contributes to hypoventilation and whether respective deletion of SOCS3 in the NTS and RTN could mitigate hypoventilation in diet-induced obesity (DIO) male mice. Our findings revealed a decrease in the number of CO",

Nevertheless, active modulation has not been completely removed in QKD systems so far, due to both theoretical and practical limitations. In this Letter, we present a fully passive time-bin encoding QKD system and report on the successful implementation of a modulator-free QKD link. According to the latest theoretical analysis, our prototype is capable of delivering competitive secret key rates in the finite key regime.",

        "Title": "Parallel perception of visual motion using light-tunable memory matrix.",
        "Abstract": "Parallel perception of visual motion is of crucial significance to the development of an intelligent machine vision system. However, implementing in-sensor parallel visual motion perception using conventional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology is challenging, because the temporal and spatial information embedded in motion cannot be simultaneously encoded and perceived at the sensory level. Here, we demonstrate the parallel perception of diverse motion modes at the sensor level by exploiting light-tunable memory matrix in a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure array. The optoelectronic characteristics of gate-tunable photoconductivity and light-tunable memory matrix enable devices in the array to realize simultaneous encoding and processing of incoming spatiotemporal light pattern. Furthermore, we implement a visual motion perceptron with the array capable of deciphering multiple motion parameters in parallel, including direction, velocity, acceleration, and angular velocity. Our work opens up a promising venue for the realization of an intelligent machine vision system based on in-sensor motion perception.",

        "Abstract": "Structure-based virtual screening plays a critical role in drug discovery. However, numerous docking programs, such as AutoDock Vina and Glide, are time-consuming due to the necessity of generating numerous molecular conformations and executing steps like scoring, ranking, and refinement for the ligand-receptor complexes. Consequently, achieving rapid and reliable virtual screening remains a noteworthy challenge. Recently, a team of researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, led by St\u00e4rk et al., developed an SE(3)-equivariant geometric deep learning based protein-ligand binding prediction approach, EQUIBIND. In comparison to conventional docking methods, EQUIBIND has the capacity to predict the binding modes of small molecules with target proteins rapidly and precisely. It presents an innovative resolution for high-throughput screening of drug-like compounds.",

        "Title": "Unveiling the novel role of ryegrass rhizospheric metabolites in benzo[a]pyrene biodegradation.",
        "Abstract": "Rhizoremediation is a promising remediation technology for the removal of soil persistent organic pollutants (POPs), especially benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). However, our understanding of the associations among rhizospheric soil metabolites, functional microorganisms, and POPs degradation in different plant growth stages is limited. We combined stable-isotope probing (SIP), high-throughput sequencing, and metabolomics to analyze changes in rhizospheric soil metabolites, functional microbes, and BaP biodegradation in the early growth stages (tillering, jointing) and later stage (booting) of ryegrass. Microbial community structures differed significantly among growth stages. Metabolisms such as benzenoids and carboxylic acids tended to be enriched in the early growth stage, while lipids and organic heterocyclic compounds dominated in the later stage. From SIP, eight BaP-degrading microbes were identified, and most of which such as Ilumatobacter and Singulisphaera were first linked with BaP biodegradation. Notably, the relationship between the differential metabolites and BaP degradation efficiency further suggested that BaP-degrading microbes might metabolize BaP directly to produce benzenoid metabolites (3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene), or utilize benzenoids (phyllodulcin) to stimulate the co-metabolism of BaP in early growth stage; some lipids and organic acids, e.g. 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, might provide nutrients for the degraders to promote BaP metabolism in later stage. Accordingly, we determined that certain rhizospheric metabolites might regulate the rhizospheric microbial communities at different growth stages, and shift the composition and diversity of BaP-degrading bacteria, thereby enhancing in situ BaP degradation. Our study sheds light on POPs rhizoremediation mechanisms in petroleum-contaminated soils.",

        "Abstract": "Sustained cardiac hypertrophy damages the heart and weakens cardiac function, often leading to heart failure and even death. Pathological cardiac hypertrophy has become a central therapeutic target for many heart diseases including heart failure. However, the underlying mechanisms of cardiac hypertrophy, especially the involvement of autophagy program, are still ill-understood. Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7), a multifunctional and high-affinity calcium sensor, plays a pivotal role in asynchronous neurotransmitter release, synaptic facilitation, and vesicle pool regulation during synaptic transmission. However, little is known about whether Syt7 is expressed in the myocardium and involved in the pathogenesis of heart diseases. Here we showed that Syt7 was significantly upregulated in Ang II-treated hearts and cardiomyocytes. Homozygous syt7 knockout (syt7-/-) mice exhibited significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and improved cardiac function. We further found that Syt7 exerted a pro-hypertrophic effect by suppressing the autophagy process. In exploring the upstream mechanisms, microRNA (miR)-93 was identified to participate in the regulation of Syt7 expression. miR-93 protected hearts against Ang II-induced hypertrophy through targeting Syt7-autophagy pathway. In summary, our data reveal a new cardiac hypertrophy regulator and a novel hypertrophy regulating model composed of miR-93, Syt7 and autophagy program. These molecules may serve as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.",

        "Abstract": "Co-contamination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and nitrogen (N) is widespread. Here, N removal and PCBs degradation were investigated in constructed wetlands populated with Myriophyllum aquaticum, and the role of N in PCBs degradation was explored as well. Nearly 97% of N was removed in the planted system, whereas less than 40% was removed in the plant-free system. Compared to the treatment with plants and no N amendment, N addition enhanced plant growth by 31.9% and PCBs removal by 9.90%. PCBs attenuation was mainly attributed to microbial degradation rather than plant uptake. Using DNA stable-isotope probing, 26 operational taxonomic units were identified across all treatments, of which 25 were linked to PCBs degradation for the first time. Some PCB-degraders were associated with nitrification/denitrification and were significantly enriched in the treatment that included both plants and N application, indicating that PCBs degradation was promoted by recruiting ammonia-oxidising and denitrifying microbes with PCBs metabolic ability. This was confirmed by the higher A13/A12 ratios for the bphC, amoA, and nirK genes and their significant positive correlations. Overall, the findings clarify the novel mechanism by which N promotes PCBs degradation in constructed wetlands and offers a theoretical basis for efficiently removing inorganic elements and persistent organic pollutants.",

        "Abstract": "The growth in biomedical data resources has raised potential privacy concerns and risks of genetic information leakage. For instance, exome sequencing aids clinical decisions by comparing data through web services, but it requires significant trust between users and providers. To alleviate privacy concerns, the most commonly used strategy is to anonymize sensitive data. Unfortunately, studies have shown that anonymization is insufficient to protect against reidentification attacks. Recently, privacy-preserving technologies have been applied to preserve application utility while protecting the privacy of biomedical data. We present the PICOTEES framework, a privacy-preserving online service of phenotype exploration for genetic-diagnostic variants (https://birthdefectlab.cn:3000/). PICOTEES enables privacy-preserving queries of the phenotype spectrum for a single variant by utilizing trusted execution environment technology, which can protect the privacy of the user's query information, backend models, and data, as well as the final results. We demonstrate the utility and performance of PICOTEES by exploring a bioinformatics dataset. The dataset is from a cohort containing 20,909 genetic testing patients with 3,152,508 variants from the Children's Hospital of Fudan University in China, dominated by the Chinese Han population (>99.9%). Our query results yield a large number of unreported diagnostic variants and previously reported pathogenicity.",

        "Abstract": "The rapid development of renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, and pulsed equipment requires energy storage media to have a high energy storage density and efficiency in a wide temperature range. The state-of-the-art biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film is insufficient to meet the growing demand for energy storage devices due to its low energy storage density and working temperature, which make it a research hotspot for developing dielectric energy storage materials. In this manuscript, based on the epoxy materials that have been shown as a potential energy storage medium, we aim to reduce the influence of the benzene ring delocalization structure on the energy storage losses and enhance the efficiency by gradually replacing them with cyclohexane structures to adjust the segment unsaturation of epoxy materials. The results show that by partially reducing the unsaturation of the curing agent, the epoxy material achieves an excellent high-temperature energy storage density of 2.21 J/cm",

        "Abstract": "Th17\u00a0cells triggered inflammation is a critical element in cerebral ischemic injury, and the gut microbiota intricately impacts T lymphocytes. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the gut microbiota involves in cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR) induced-brain injury through Th17\u00a0cells. The present study investigated the interaction between gut microbiota and Th17\u00a0cells in a rat model. We observed that CA/CPR induced the alterations of the gut microbial community structure, and elevated the level of IL-17 in the serum, and a slight infiltration of Th17\u00a0cells into the brain. The Th17\u00a0cells were increased significantly in the peripheral blood, 28.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.18% of these Th17\u00a0cells were derived from the Peyer's patches of small intestine. Furthermore, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from rats with CA/CPR induced Th17\u00a0cell response, promoting hippocampal cell apoptosis and declining learning ability and memory in recipient rats. Taken together, CA/CPR-induced alterations of the gut microbial community structure stimulated Th17\u00a0cell response which aggravated brain injury.",

We investigated the metabolic alterations between CRC patients and NI, and identified some potential biomarkers, and these biomarkers might be used as indicators for diagnosis of CRC. In this study, there were 79 NI, 50 CRC I patients, 52 CRC II patients, 56 CRC III patients, and 52 CRC IV patients. MS-MS was used to measure the metabolic alterations. Univariate and multivariate data analysis and metabolic pathway analysis were applied to analyze metabolic data and determine differential metabolites. These indicators revealed that amino acid and fatty acids could separate these groups. Several metabolites indicated an excellent variables capability in the separation of CRC patients and NI. Ornithine, arginine, octadecanoyl carnitine, palmitoyl carnitine, adipoyl carnitine, and butyryl carnitine/propanoyl carnitine were selected to distinguish the CRC patients and NI. And methionine and propanoyl carnitine, were directly linked to different stages of CRC. Receiver operating characteristics curves and variables importance in projection both represented an excellent performance of these metabolites. In conclusion, we assessed the difference between CRC patients and NI, which supports guidelines for an early diagnosis and effective treatment.",

        "Abstract": "The regulation of the expression of genes related to abiotic stress in plants is significantly influenced by the binding of the transcription factor (TF) WRKY to the W-box elements in their promoters. The findings of this study have confirmed that the ability of Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum Gaertn.) to tolerate phosphorus (P) deficiency is regulated by FtWRKY29, which is classified as a member of group II of the WRKY family. The roots predominantly exhibited an enhanced expression of FtWRKY29, which was significantly upregulated in response to low-P-induced stress. The W-box motif was bound to by FtWRKY29 which enhanced the transcription of genes and was localized to the nucleus. The overexpression of FtWRKY29 in Arabidopsis thaliana produced transgenic lines that exhibited phenotypes typical of diminished sensitivity to low-P-induced stress by promoting root growth, increasing P-uptake, and regulating the accumulation of anthocyanin. The low-P-responsive genes, PHT1;1, PHT1;4, and PHO1 were significantly up-regulated in these lines. In addition, the overexpression of FtWRKY29 restored the P-absorption ability of the wrky75 mutant to a certain extent. Moreover, the binding of FtWRKY29 to the promoter of PHT1;1 activated its expression in tobacco. It was also observed that FtWRKY29 interacts with AtMPK3, AtMPK6, FtMPK3, and FtMPK7. This study provides preliminary evidence that FtWRKY29 improved the tolerance of transgenic A. thaliana plants to low-P-induced stress and deepened the understanding of the regulatory mechanism behind the same in Tartary buckwheat.",

        "Abstract": "This study explores natural direct and joint natural indirect effects (JNIE) of prenatal opioid exposure on neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in children mediated through pregnancy complications, major and minor congenital malformations, and adverse neonatal outcomes, using Medicaid claims linked to vital statistics in Rhode Island, United States, 2008-2018. A Bayesian mediation analysis with elastic net shrinkage prior was developed to estimate mean time to NDD diagnosis ratio using posterior mean and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) from Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Simulation studies showed desirable model performance. Of 11,176 eligible pregnancies, 332 had \u22652 dispensations of prescription opioids anytime during pregnancy, including 200 (1.8%) having \u22651 dispensation in the first trimester (T1), 169 (1.5%) in the second (T2), and 153 (1.4%) in the third (T3). A significant JNIE of opioid exposure was observed in each trimester (T1, JNIE = 0.97, 95% CrI: 0.95, 0.99; T2, JNIE = 0.97, 95% CrI: 0.95, 0.99; T3, JNIE = 0.96, 95% CrI: 0.94, 0.99). The proportion of JNIE in each trimester was 17.9% (T1), 22.4% (T2), and 56.3% (T3). In conclusion, adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes jointly mediated the association between prenatal opioid exposure and accelerated time to NDD diagnosis. The proportion of JNIE increased as the timing of opioid exposure approached delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondria play essential roles in cancer cell adaptation to hypoxia, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Through mitochondrial proteomic profiling, we here find that the prolyl hydroxylase EglN1 (PHD2) accumulates on mitochondria under hypoxia. EglN1 substrate-binding region in the \u03b22\u03b23 loop is responsible for its mitochondrial translocation and contributes to breast tumor growth. Furthermore, we identify AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPK\u03b1) as an EglN1 substrate on mitochondria. The EglN1-AMPK\u03b1 interaction is essential for their mutual mitochondrial translocation. After EglN1 prolyl-hydroxylates AMPK\u03b1 under normoxia, they rapidly dissociate following prolyl-hydroxylation, leading to their immediate release from mitochondria. In contrast, hypoxia results in constant EglN1-AMPK\u03b1 interaction and their accumulation on mitochondria, leading to the formation of a Ca",

        "Abstract": "A. hydrophila (Aeromonas hydrophila) is one of the most hazardous pathogenic microorganisms threatening the aquaculture industry and exhibits zoonotic-like characteristics. This study was designed to investigate the differential gene expression and pathway enrichment in the spleen of koi carp (Cyprinus carpio koi) upon A. hydrophila infection. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used to identify 252 DEGs (differentially expressed genes), including 112 upregulated genes and 140 downregulated genes, in the spleens of koi carp challenged with A. hydrophila compared to those in the spleens of koi carp treated with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline). DEGs were shown to be involved in 133 pathways by KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analysis. Numerous immunological disease-related pathways, such as the immune defense network for IgA production, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and antigen processing and presentation, were enriched in the DEGs. In addition, the expression levels of 10 randomly screened DEGs, including the inflammatory factor nlrp3 (NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3), cytokine il-8 (interleukin-8), c2 (complement c2), c3 (complement c3), and the lipid mediator cox1 (cyclooxygenase-1), were compared by qPCR. The results showed that six genes, including il-8, cox1, and nlrp3, were upregulated according to both RNA-seq and qPCR validation, while four, including c2 and c3, showed downregulated expression. This result verified a strong correlation between the RNA-seq and qPCR datasets at the expression level. Moreover, this study provided splenic transcriptome data for koi carp during A. hydrophila infection and provided theoretical support for future drug development.",

However, not all polysaccharides have significant pharmacodynamic activity; hence, appropriate chemical modification methods can be selected according to the unique structural characteristics of polysaccharides to assist in enhancing and promoting the presentation of their biological activities. This review summarizes research progress on modified polysaccharides, including common chemical modification methods, the change in biological activity following modification, and the factors affecting the biological activity of chemically modified polysaccharides. At the same time, the difficulties and challenges associated with the structural modification of natural polysaccharides are also outlined in this review. Thus, research on polysaccharide structure modification is critical for improving the development and utilization of sugar products.",

        "Abstract": "The characteristics of high burning rate, high energy output, and low pressure exponent have always been the focus of development in the field of composite solid rocket propellants. In this paper, a metal-organic framework (MOF-199) compound is introduced to prepare micro-nanospherical CL-20@MOF-199 composites via the spray-drying self-assembly technique to reach the above goals. MOF-199, which acts as an attractive combustion catalyst and a safety regulator, is uniformly coated on the surface of CL-20 with close interface contact between particles, effectively accelerating the thermal decomposition of CL-20 and ensuring safety performance. The average noncovalent interaction (aNCI) analysis illustrates that there are strong C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interaction between CL-20 and MOF-199 molecules, greatly enhancing the effect of interparticle assembly. The effects of different contents of MOF-199 on the thermal, safety, and energy properties of CL-20 were discussed. The thermal analysis demonstrates that MOF-199 has a significant thermal catalytic effect on CL-20, with an advanced peak temperature of thermal decomposition of 14.2 \u00b0C and a reduced activation energy barrier of 34.2 kJ\u00b7mol",

        "Abstract": "Aeromonas hydrophila is a conditional pathogen impacting public hygiene and safety. Hemolysin is a virulence factor of Aeromonas hydrophila that causes erythrocyte hemolysis, yet its transcriptional response to Cyprinus rubrofuscus remains unknown. Our investigation confirmed the hemolysis of hemolysin from A. hydrophila. Serum enzyme activity was evaluated weekly after C. rubrofuscus were immunized with hemolysin Ahh1. The results showed that the hemolysin enhances the serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), lysozyme (LZM), and catalase (CAT) activity, which reached a maximum on day 14. To elucidate the molecular interaction between hemolysin from A. hydrophila and the host, we performed transcriptome sequencing on the spleen of C. rubrofuscus 14 days post hemolysin infection. The total number of clean reads was 41.37\u00a0Gb, resulting in 79,832 unigenes with an N50 length of 1863\u00a0bp. There were 1982 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 1083 upregulated genes and 899 downregulated genes. Transcript levels of the genes, such as LA6BL, CD2, and NLRC5, were significantly downregulated, while those of IL11, IL1R2, and IL8 were dramatically upregulated. The DEGs were mainly enriched in the immune disease, viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor, and toll-like receptor pathways, suggesting that hemolysin stimulation can activate the transcriptional responses. RT-qPCR experiments results of seven genes, IL-8, STAT2, CTSK, PRF1, CXCL9, TLR5, and SACS, showed that their expression was highly concordant with RNA-seq data. We clarified for the first time the key genes and signaling pathways response to hemolysin from A. hydrophila, which offers strategies for treating and preventing diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has dramatically changed cancer treatment, opening novel opportunities to cure malignant diseases. To date, most prevalently targeted immune checkpoints are programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), with many others being under extensive investigations. However, according to available data, only a fraction of patients may respond to ICI therapy. Additionally, this therapy may cause severe adverse immune-related side effects, such as diarrhea, headache, muscle weakness, rash, hepatitis and leucopenia, although most of them are not fatal, they can affect the patient's treatment outcome and quality of life. On the other hand, growing evidence has shown that phytochemicals with anticancer effects may combine ICI therapy to augment the safety and effectiveness of the treatment against cancer while reducing the adverse side effects. In this review, we summarize the state of art in the various experiments and clinical application of ICIs plus phytochemicals, with a focus on their combined use as a novel therapeutic strategy to cure cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Liver fibrosis is a substantial risk factor for the development and progression of liver cancer, which includes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). Studies utilizing cell fate mapping and single-cell transcriptomics techniques have identified quiescent perisinusoidal hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) as the primary source of activated collagen-producing HSCs and liver cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in HCC\u00a0and liver metastasis, complemented in iCCA by contributions from portal fibroblasts. At the same time, integrative computational analysis of single-cell, single-nucleus and spatial RNA sequencing data have revealed marked heterogeneity among HSCs and CAFs, with distinct subpopulations displaying unique gene expression signatures and functions. Some of these subpopulations have divergent roles in promoting or inhibiting liver fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis. In this Review, we discuss the dual roles of HSC subpopulations in liver fibrogenesis and their contribution to liver cancer promotion, progression and metastasis. We review the transcriptomic and functional similarities between HSC and CAF subpopulations, highlighting the pathways that either promote or prevent fibrosis and cancer, and the immunological landscape from which these pathways emerge. Insights from ongoing studies will yield novel strategies for developing biomarkers, assessing prognosis and generating new therapies for both HCC and iCCA prevention and treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Liquefaction of microalgae in ethanol offers an eco-friendly bio-oil alternative, but solvent recycling is crucial for sustainability due to extra costs. In this work, Chlorella vulgaris was liquefied in supercritical ethanol at 260\u00a0\u00b0C, and the solvent phase (SP) separated from bio-oil was recovered and reused. Five liquefaction cycles were performed at identical temperature and pressure conditions to investigate the effects on oil production and nitrogen transformation. The findings demonstrated a gradual increase in water content in recycled SP. Ethanol-water co-solvent as the reaction medium promoted the decomposition and re-polymerization of protein in raw material, thus increasing the bio-oil yield (76.84\u00a0%) and higher heating value (33.53\u00a0MJ/kg) to some extent. Simultaneously, the relative nitrogen content of bio-oil rose from 8.03\u00a0% to 8.52\u00a0%, predominantly in the form of nitrogen heterocycles. The potential pathway for nitrogen conversion was revealed, which establishes a theoretical basis for the subsequent denitrification of bio-oil.",

        "Abstract": "Although organophosphate esters (OPEs) and nitrogen (N) are normally present in aquatic environments, the effects of the plant uptake, accumulation, and translocation of OPEs in different levels of N remain ambiguous. To better understand these processes, watermifoil (Myriophyllum aquaticum L.) as tested plant was chosen to investigate the effects of different N levels on the uptake and translocation of OPEs by plants in matched water-sediment-plant samples. After two months, we found the root-water concentration factors, root-sediment concentration factors, and translocation factors (TFs) were significantly changed with the levels of N (p < 0.05), implying that the presence of N could alter uptake, accumulation, and translocation of OPEs in M. aquaticum, particularly the process of root absorption. Low concentrations of N could remarkably promote the uptake of OPEs by M. aquaticum. However, when the concentrations of N in water were higher than 200 mg/L, the plants' growth and OPE accumulation by M. aquaticum were obviously inhibited with the elevated N contents. Moreover, the enrichment and environmental transport of OPEs in M. aquaticum seemed to be closely associated with physicochemical parameters; the octanol-water partition coefficient had significant relationships with measured organic carbon-normalized sediment-water partition coefficients and TFs in the present study. Additionally, the substituents and structures of OPEs could also affect the accumulation and translocation of OPEs in M. aquaticum, including the chlorination degree and alkyl chain length. This study could improve our understanding of uptake and translocation of OPEs in aquatic plants under different levels of N.",

        "Abstract": "The use of bacteria and their biotic components as therapeutics has shown great potential in the treatment of diseases. Orally delivered bacteria improve patient compliance compared with injection-administered bacteria and are considered the preferred mode. However, due to the harsh gastrointestinal environment, the viability and therapeutic efficacy of orally delivered bacteria are significantly reduced in vivo. In recent years, with the rapid development of synthetic biology and nanotechnology, bacteria and biotic components have been engineered to achieve directed genetic reprogramming for construction and precise spatiotemporal control in the gastrointestinal tract, which can improve viability and therapeutic efficiency. Herein, a state-of-the-art review on the current progress of engineered bacterial systems for oral delivery is provided. The different types\u00a0of bacterial and biotic components for oral administration are first summarized. The engineering strategies of these bacteria and biotic components and their treatment of diseases are next systematically summarized. Finally, the current challenges and prospects of these bacterial therapeutics are highlighted that will contribute to the development of next-generation orally delivered bacteriotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "The organic dyes used in printing and dyeing wastewater have complex components, diverse structures and strong chemical stability, which make them not suitable for treatment and difficult to degrade in the environment. Porphyrins are macromolecules with 18 \u03c0 electrons formed by four pyrrole molecules connected with a methylene bridge that has a stable structure. Porphyrin combines with iron to form an active intermediate with a structure similar to the cytochrome P450 enzyme, so they are widely used in the biomimetic field. In the current study, 5,10,15,20-tetra (4-carboxyphenyl) porphine ferric chloride (III) (Fe(III)TCPP) was used as a catalyst and iodosobenzene was used as an oxidant to explore the catalytic degradation of triphenylmethane dyes, such as rhodamine B (RhB) and malachite green (MG). The results of UV-Vis spectral analysis have shown that the conversion rate of the rhodamine B was over 90% when the amount of Fe(III)TCPP was 0.027 mM and the amount of iodosobenzene was eight equivalents. When the catalyst was 0.00681 mM and the amount of the oxidant was five equivalents, the conversion rate of the malachite green reached over 95%. This work provides a feasible method for the degradation of triphenylmethane dyes.",

The fully understanding of the pollutants emission and transportation is crucial for coastal environment management. However, the influence of such highly dynamic coastal process on the pollutant migration remain unclear, such as the effects of coastal seasonal hydrodynamics on the dissolved pollutant transportation, especially under intensive marine ranching activities in open waters. This study investigated the seasonal transport mechanisms of pollutants released from three typical mariculture methods (floating raft, cage and bottom pond) in the Wangjia Island (WJ), Yellow Sea, China. We have conducted three field surveys to monitor the coastal dynamics and measure the distribution of dissolved pollutants in the ranching area. Results from these field surveys show that the WJ and adjacent area experienced significant degradation in terms of water quality with the development of regional marine ranching.

        "Abstract": "The therapeutic efficacy of whole tumor cell vaccines (TCVs) is modest, which has delayed their translation into personalized immunotherapies in the clinic. Here, we develop a TCV platform based on photothermal nanoparticle-loaded tumor cells, which can be rationally applied to diverse tumor types to achieve on-demand boost of anti-tumor immune responses for inhibiting tumor growth. During the fabrication process, mild photothermal heating by near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation induces the nanoparticle-bearing tumor cells to express heat shock proteins as endogenous adjuvants. After a single vaccination at the back of tumor-bearing mice, non-invasive NIR laser irradiation further induces mild hyperthermia at vaccination site, which promotes the recruitment, activation, and antigen presentation by dendritic cells. Using an indicator we term fluctuation of tumor growth rate, we determine appropriate irradiation regimens (including optimized irradiation intervals and times). This TCV platform enables on-demand NIR manipulation of immune responses, and we demonstrate potent therapeutic efficacy against six murine models that mimick a range of clinical scenarios, including a model based on humanized mice and patient-derived tumor xenografts.",

        "Abstract": "Due to the rapid development of multi-functional flexible wearable sensors, the development prospects of ionohydrogels with excellent mechanical properties and high sensitivity are necessary. In this work, a novel waterborne polyurethane (WPU) micelle with reactive groups on the surface has been prepared as a crosslinker and then reacted with polyacrylamide (PAM) to obtain a polyacrylamide-polyurethane/ionic liquid (PAM-WPU/IL) ionohydrogel. With the aid of ion-dipole interaction and crosslinks in the composite, the ionohydrogel exhibited ultrastretchability (up to 2927%), good mechanical resilience, and excellent self-adhesion strength (46.01 kPa). Furthermore, the ionohydrogel was used as a strain sensor for monitoring human movement with high strain sensitivity (gauge factor = 35). It is believed that this study provides a new idea for designing a multifunctional ionohydrogel for use in wearable electronics.",

With the development of biotechnology, biomedical materials have reached the \"smart\" stage. To date, despite their inability to overcome all the aforementioned drawbacks, a variety of smart materials have been widely tested to treat various ocular diseases. This review analyses the most recent developments in multiple smart materials (inorganic particles, polymeric particles, lipid-based particles, hydrogels, and devices) to treat common ocular diseases and discusses the future directions and perspectives regarding clinical translation issues. This review can help researchers rationally design more smart materials for specific ocular applications.",

        "Abstract": "Accurately extracting buildings from aerial images has essential research significance for timely understanding human intervention on the land. The distribution discrepancies between diversified unlabeled remote sensing images (changes in imaging sensor, location, and environment) and labeled historical images significantly degrade the generalization performance of deep learning algorithms. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) algorithms have recently been proposed to eliminate the distribution discrepancies without re-annotating training data for new domains. Nevertheless, due to the limited information provided by a single-source domain, single-source UDA (SSUDA) is not an optimal choice when multitemporal and multiregion remote sensing images are available. We propose a multisource UDA (MSUDA) framework SPENet for building extraction, aiming at selecting, purifying, and exchanging information from multisource domains to better adapt the model to the target domain. Specifically, the framework effectively utilizes richer knowledge by extracting target-relevant information from multiple-source domains, purifying target domain information with low-level features of buildings, and exchanging target domain information in an interactive learning manner. Extensive experiments and ablation studies constructed on 12 city datasets prove the effectiveness of our method against existing state-of-the-art methods, e.g., our method achieves 59.1% intersection over union (IoU) on Austin and Kitsap \u2192 Potsdam, which surpasses the target domain supervised method by 2.2% .

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to introduce the use of an acellular dermal matrix (ADM) as a posterior lamellar substitution for full-thickness eyelid reconstruction after malignant tumor excision. After resection of the malignant eyelid tumors, anterior lamellar defects were repaired using direct sutures and pedicled flaps in 20 patients (15 men and 5 women). ADM was used to replace the tarsal plate and the conjunctiva. All patients were followed up for 6 months or more to assess the functional and esthetic outcomes of the procedure. The flaps survived in all but 2 cases, wherein they necrosed due to insufficient blood supply. The functionality and esthetic outcomes were excellent in 10 and 9 patients, respectively. There were no changes in visual acuity or corneal epithelial damage after the surgery. The eyeball movement was good. Corneal irritation no longer appeared, and patient comfort was maintained. Furthermore, no tumor recurrence occurred in any patient. ADM is a valuable posterior lamellar material for the full-thickness reconstruction of eyelid defects after the resection of malignant tumors on the eyelids.",

        "Abstract": "Cholesterol in the circulation is partly driven by changes in feed intake, but aspects of cholesterol metabolism during development of fatty liver are not well known. The objective of this study was to investigate mechanisms of cholesterol metabolism in calf hepatocytes challenged with high concentrations of fatty acids (FA). To address mechanistic insights regarding cholesterol metabolism, liver samples were collected from healthy control dairy cows (n = 6; 7-13 d in milk) and cows with fatty liver (n = 6; 7-11 d in milk). In vitro, hepatocytes isolated from 3 healthy female calves (1 d old) were challenged with or without a mix of 1.2 mM FA to induce metabolic stress. In addition, hepatocytes were processed with 10 \u00b5mol/L of the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor simvastatin or 6 \u00b5mol/L of the cholesterol intracellular transport inhibitor U18666A with or without the 1.2 mM FA mix. To evaluate the role of cholesterol addition, hepatocytes were treated with 0.147 mg/mL methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD + FA) or 0.147 mg/mL M\u03b2CD with or without 10 and 100 \u00b5mol/L cholesterol before incubation with FA (CHO10 + FA and CHO100 + FA). In vivo data from liver biopsies were analyzed by 2-tailed unpaired Student's t-test. Data from in vitro calf hepatocytes were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Compared with healthy cows, blood plasma total cholesterol and plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol content in cows with fatty liver was markedly lower, whereas the hepatic total cholesterol content did not differ. In contrast, compared with healthy controls, the triacylglycerol content in the liver and the content of FA, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, and aspartate aminotransferase in the plasma of cows with fatty liver were greater. The results revealed that both fatty liver in vivo and challenge of calf hepatocytes with 1.2 mM FA in vitro led to greater mRNA and protein abundance of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). In contrast, mRNA and protein abundance of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF2), acyl coenzyme A-cholesterol acyltransferase, and ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) were lower. Compared with the FA group, the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor simvastatin led to greater protein abundance of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and mRNA abundance of SREBF2, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), ACAT2, and lower ABCA1 and FASN protein abundance. In contrast, compared with the FA group, the cholesterol intracellular transport inhibitor U18666A + FA led to greater total cholesterol concentration and greater protein and mRNA abundance of FASN. Compared with the M\u03b2CD + FA group, the addition of 10 \u00b5mol/L cholesterol led to greater concentration of cholesteryl ester and excretion of apolipoprotein B100, and greater protein and mRNA abundance of ABCA1 and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, and lower concentration of malondialdehyde. Overall, a reduction in cholesterol synthesis promoted FA metabolism in hepatocytes likely to relieve the oxidative stress caused by the high FA load. The data suggest that maintenance of normal cholesterol synthesis promotes very low-density lipoprotein excretion and can reduce lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in dairy cows that experience fatty liver.",

        "Abstract": "Dyes that are released into the environment may have negative effects on living organisms. To address this issue, a biomass-derived carbon adsorbent made from Enteromorpha was tested for its ability to remove methyl orange (MO) from wastewater. The adsorbent was found to be effective in removing MO, with a 1:4 impregnation ratio producing an adsorbent that could remove 96.34% of MO from a 200\u00a0mg/L solution using only 0.1\u00a0g of adsorbent. At higher concentrations, the adsorption capacity increased up to 269.58\u00a0mg/g. Through molecular dynamics simulations, it was discovered that after mono-layer adsorption reached saturation, the remaining MO molecules in solution formed hydrogen bonds with the adsorbed MO, which led to further aggregation on the adsorbent surface and increased adsorption capacity. Additionally, theoretical investigations revealed that the adsorption energy of anionic dyes increased with Nitrogen-doped carbon materials, with the pyrrolic-N site having the highest adsorption energy for MO. The carbon material derived from Enteromorpha showed promise in treating wastewater containing anionic dyes, thanks to its high adsorption capacity and strong electrostatic interaction with the sulfonic acid groups of MO.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic insomnia disorder and major depressive disorder are highly-occurred mental diseases with extensive social harm. The comorbidity of these two diseases is commonly seen in clinical practice, but the mechanism remains unclear. To observe the characteristics of cerebral blood perfusion and functional connectivity in patients, so as to explore the potential pathogenesis and biological imaging markers, thereby improving the understanding of their comorbidity mechanism. 44 patients with chronic insomnia disorder comorbid major depressive disorder and 43 healthy controls were recruited in this study. The severity of insomnia and depression were assessed by questionnaire. The cerebral blood perfusion and functional connectivity values of participants were obtained to, analyze their correlation with questionnaire scores. The cerebral blood flow in cerebellum, vermis, right hippocampus, left parahippocampal gyrus of patients were reduced, which was negatively related to the severity of insomnia or depression. The connectivities of left cerebellum-right putamen and right hippocampus-left inferior frontal gyrus were increased, showing positive correlations with the severity of insomnia and depression. Decreased connectivities of left cerebellum-left fusiform gyrus, left cerebellum-left occipital lobe, right hippocampus-right paracentral lobule, right hippocampus-right precentral gyrus were partially associated with insomnia or depression. The connectivity of right hippocampus-left inferior frontal gyrus may mediate between insomnia and depression. Insomnia and depression can cause changes in cerebral blood flow and brain function. Changes in the cerebellar and hippocampal regions are the result of insomnia and depression. They reflect abnormalities in sleep and emotion regulation. That may be involved in the pathogenesis of comorbidity.",

        "Abstract": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play an important role in the production, and transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) as a convergence for human, animal, and environmental wastewater. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatio-temporal variation and influencing factors of ARB in different functional areas of the urban WWTP and the connecting rivers for 1-year monitoring using extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-Ec) as an indicator bacteria, and to study the transmission patterns of ARB in the aquatic environment. The results showed that ESBL-Ec isolates were identified from the WWTP (n\u00a0=\u00a0219), including influent (n\u00a0=\u00a053), anaerobiotic tank (n\u00a0=\u00a040), aerobiotic tank (n\u00a0=\u00a036), activated sludge tank (n\u00a0=\u00a031), sludge thickner tank (n\u00a0=\u00a030), effluent (n\u00a0=\u00a016), and mudcake storage area (n\u00a0=\u00a013). The dehydration process can significantly remove the ESBL-Ec isolates; however, ESBL-Ec was still detected in samples collected from the effluent of the WWTP (37.0%). The detection rate of ESBL-Ec was significantly different across seasons (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and ambient temperature was negatively correlated with the detection rate of ESBL-Ec (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, a high prevalence of ESBL-Ec isolates (29/187, 15.5%) was detected in samples collected from the river system. These findings emphasize that the high majority of ESBL-Ec in aquatic environments is alarming because it poses a significant threat to public health. Clonal transmission of ESBL-Ec isolates between the WWTP and rivers based on the spatio-temporal scale was observed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis, ST38 and ST69 ESBL-Ec clone were selected as prioritized isolates for antibiotic resistance monitoring in the aquatic environment. Further phylogenetic analysis showed human-associated (feces, blood) E. coli was the main source contributing to the presence of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments. Longitudinal and targeted monitoring of ESBL-Ec in WWTPs and the development of effective wastewater disinfection strategies before effluent discharge from WWTPs are urgently required, to prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment.",

        "Abstract": "The use of disinfection materials and instruments is an important part of surgical operation. Hospital environment and surgical equipment need comprehensive sterilization treatment. This process is the key to the success of the operation, and it is also one of the first ways to control the hospital to avoid infection during the operation. The selection of scientific and reasonable sterilization methods for infection will directly affect the safety of medical treatment. In order to improve the antibacterial properties of medical non-woven fabrics, this paper combines two antibacterial methods of sterilization and antibacterial adhesion, and uses the principle of nanotechnology to design that the non-woven fabrics have good blood compatibility in the sterilization process. Then, a new composite antibacterial nanoparticle antibacterial solution is prepared from the synthesized nano\u2011silver solution, and the antibacterial solution is attached to the non-woven fabric, so that the nano\u2011silver particles with antibacterial effect are fixed on the surface of the fabric, and its antibacterial effect is measured through the antibacterial test, and excellent hospital infection sterilization technology is prepared and applied to the non-woven fabric products. The fusion experiment of platelets and red blood cells shows that the prepared surface technology combined with antibacterial adhesion and sterilization can effectively fuse with platelets and red blood cells, and can also effectively prevent the adhesion of platelets and red blood cells, and shows good blood compatibility, which is applicable to the sterilization process of hospital infection.",

        "Abstract": "Drug resistance causes catastrophic cancer treatment failures. Mutations in target proteins with altered drug binding indicate a main mechanism of cancer drug resistance (CDR). Global research has generated considerable CDR-related data and well-established knowledge bases and predictive tools. Unfortunately, these resources are fragmented and underutilized. Here, we examine computational resources for exploring CDR caused by target mutations, analyzing these tools based on their functional characteristics, data capacity, data sources, methodologies and performance. We also discuss their disadvantages and provide examples of how potential inhibitors of CDR have been discovered using these resources. This toolkit is designed to help specialists explore resistance occurrence effectively and to explain resistance prediction to non-specialists easily.",

        "Abstract": "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a positive-strand RNA virus of the genus Pestivirus in the Flaviviridae family, is the causative agent of bovine viral diarrhea-mucosal disease (BVD-MD). BVDV's unique virion structure, genome, and replication mechanism in the Flaviviridae family render it a useful alternative model for evaluating the effectiveness of antiviral drugs used against the hepatitis C virus (HCV). As one of the most abundant and typical heat shock proteins, HSP70 plays an important role in viral infection caused by the family Flaviviridae and is considered a logical target of viral regulation in the context of immune escape. However, the mechanism of HSP70 in BVDV infection and the latest insights have not been reported in sufficient detail. In this review, we focus on the role and mechanisms of HSP70 in BVDV-infected animals/cells to further explore the possibility of targeting this protein for antiviral therapy during viral infection.",

        "Abstract": "The operating skills of vascular interventionists have an important impact on the effect of surgery. However, current research on behavior recognition and skills learning of interventionists' operating skills is limited. In this study, an innovative deep learning-based multimodal information fusion architecture is proposed for recognizing and analyzing eight common operating behaviors of interventionists. An experimental platform integrating four modal sensors is used to collect multimodal data from interventionists. The ANOVA and Manner-Whitney tests is used for relevance analysis of the data. The analysis results demonstrate that there is almost no significant difference ( p <0.001) between the actions related to the unimodal data, which cannot be used for accurate behavior recognition. Therefore, a study of the fusion architecture based on the existing machine learning classifier and the proposed deep learning fusion architecture is carried out. The research findings indicate that the proposed deep learning-based fusion architecture achieves an impressive overall accuracy of 98.5%, surpassing both the machine learning classifier (93.51%) and the unimodal data (90.05%). The deep learning-based multimodal information fusion architecture proves the feasibility of behavior recognition and skills learning of interventionist's operating skills. Furthermore, the application of deep learning-based multimodal fusion technology of surgeon's operating skills will help to improve the autonomy and intelligence of surgical robotic systems.",

        "Abstract": "Prototype foamy virus (PFV) is an ancient retrovirus that infects humans with persistent latent infections and non-pathogenic consequences. Lifelong latent PFV infections can be caused by restrictive factors in the host. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell regulation during PFV infection are not fully understood. The aim of the study was to investigate whether a zinc finger protein (ZFP), ZNF219, as a transcription factor, can regulate the transcriptional activity of the viral promoter. Here, using transcriptome sequencing, we found that ZNF219, is downregulated in PFV infected cells and that ZNF219 suppresses viral replication by targeting the viral 5'LTR promoter region to repress its transcription. We also found that PFV infection induced abnormal expression of miRNAs targeting the ZNF219-3'UTR to downregulate ZNF219 expression. These findings indicated that ZNF219 may be a potent antiviral factor for suppressing PFV infection, and may shed light on the mechanism of virus-host interactions.",

        "Abstract": "Colonoscopy is indispensable in the diagnosis and treatment of lower digestive tract (LDT) diseases. Skilled colonoscopists are in great demand, but it takes considerable time for beginners to become experts. In addition, patients may refuse to permit primary learners to practise colonoscopy on them. Thus, improving the instructional programmes and models for primary learners is a key issue in endoscopy training. Convenience and a self-paced, learner-centred approach make e-learning an excellent instructional prospect. Therefore, we created the Colonoscope Roaming System (CRS) to assist in colonoscopy teaching procedures. We aimed to develop the e-learning software, test it with beginner colonoscopists and evaluate its effectiveness via subjective and objective methods.",

        "Abstract": "Developing composite materials with optimized mechanics, degradation, and bioactivity for bone regeneration has long been a crucial mission. Herein, a multifunctional Mg/Poly-l-lactic acid (Mg/PLLA) composite membrane based on the \"materials plain\" concept through the accumulative rolling (AR) method is proposed. Results show that at a rolling ratio of 75%, the comprehensive mechanical properties of the membrane in the rolling direction are self-reinforced significantly (elongation at break \u224853.2%, tensile strength \u2248104.0 MPa, Young's modulus \u22482.13 GPa). This enhancement is attributed to the directional arrangement and increased crystallization of PLLA molecular chains, as demonstrated by SAXS and DSC results. Furthermore, the AR composite membrane presents a lamellar heterostructure, which not only avoids the accumulation of Mg microparticles (MgMPs) but also regulates the degradation rate. Through the contribution of bioactive MgMPs and their photothermal effect synergistically, the membrane effectively eliminates bacterial infection and accelerates vascularized bone regeneration both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the membrane exhibits outstanding rat skull bone regeneration performance in only 4 weeks, surpassing most literature reports. In short, this work develops a composite membrane with a \"one stone, four birds\" effect, opening an efficient avenue toward high-performance orthopedic materials.",

        "Abstract": "Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) mediates necroptosis and inflammation in various pathophysiologies, emerging as a pharmacological target for neurodegenerative and inflammatory indications. This phase I, first-in-human, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of GFH312, an RIPK1 inhibitor, in healthy adults. Subjects received GFH312 as a single ascending dose up to 500\u2009mg (part I) or once-daily repeated doses up to 200\u2009mg for 14\u2009days (part II). PKs were assessed using plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); PDs were assessed by phospho-RIPK1 levels. Seventy-six subjects were enrolled between April 2021 and June 2022: 38 (part I) and 19 (part II) received GFH312; 14 and five received placebo, respectively. At least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) occurred in 42.1% (part I) and 63.2% (part II) of subjects receiving GFH312, compared with 42.9% and 40.0% of subjects receiving placebo, respectively. The most common TEAE was headache (21.1%). Two treatment-related TEAEs were reported in part I and four in part II. No serious TEAEs were reported. Systemic absorption was rapid; exposure (area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration and maximum plasma concentration) increased with dose level. The GFH312 CSF concentration post 100\u2009mg single dose was approximately fourfold higher than the half maximal inhibitory concentration of human monocyte-derived macrophages necroptosis with expected central nervous system penetration. Subjects receiving GFH312 had decreased phospho-RIPK1 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells postdose. In conclusion, GFH312 was well-tolerated and demonstrated RIPK1 inhibition in healthy subjects. Ongoing studies will inform the use of GFH312 in potential indications.",

        "Abstract": "Chemotherapy is one of the most commonly treatments of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the drug resistant following chemotherapeutic treatment is a significant challenge in the clinical management of CRC. Therefore, understanding the resistance mechanisms and developing new strategies for enhancing the sensitivity are urgently needed to improve CRC outcome. Connexins contribute to the formation of gap junctions among neighboring cells and then advance gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) for transportation of ions and small molecules. Although the drug resistance resulted from GJIC dysfunctional by aberrant expression of connexins is relatively well understood, the underlying mechanisms of mechanical stiffness mediated by connexin responsible for chemoresistance are largely unknown in CRC. Here, we demonstrated that connexin 43 (CX43) expression was downregulated in CRC and that loss of CX43 expression was positively correlated with metastasis and poor prognosis of CRC patients. The CX43 overexpressing suppressed CRC progression and increased the sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) ",

        "Abstract": "Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is a malignant neoplasm of the kidney and is highly interesting due to its increasing incidence. Many studies have shown that the basement membrane (BM) plays an important role in the development of cancer, and structural and functional changes in the BM can be observed in most renal lesions. However, the role of BM in the malignant progression of PRCC and its impact on prognosis has not been fully studied. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the functional and prognostic value of basement membrane-associated genes (BMs) in PRCC patients. We identified differentially expressed BMs between PRCC tumor samples and normal tissue and systematically explored the relevance of BMs to immune infiltration. Moreover, we constructed a risk signature based on these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using Lasso regression analysis and demonstrated their independence using Cox regression analysis. Finally, we predicted 9 small molecule drugs with the potential to treat PRCC and compared the differences in sensitivity to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents between high and low-risk groups to better target patients for more precise treatment planning. Taken together, our study suggested that BMs might play a crucial role in the development of PRCC, and these results might provide new insights into the treatment of PRCC.",

Fucoidan (FD), a marine prebiotic, may further enhance the ability of probiotics to promote ulcer healing. However, neither FD nor probiotics are attached to the oral cavity and neither are well-suited for oral ulcer healing owing to the wet and highly dynamic environment. In this study, probiotic-loaded calcium alginate/fucoidan composite hydrogels were developed for use as bioactive oral ulcer patches. The well-shaped hydrogels exhibited remarkable wet-tissue adhesion, suitable swelling and mechanical properties, sustained probiotic release, and excellent storage durability. Moreover, in vitro biological assays demonstrated that the composite hydrogel exhibited excellent cyto/hemocompatibility and antimicrobial effects. Importantly, compared to commercial oral ulcer patches, bioactive hydrogels show superior therapeutic capability for promoting ulcer healing in vivo by enhancing cell migration, inducing epithelial formation and orderly collagen fiber deposition, as well as facilitating neovascularization. These results demonstrate that this novel composite hydrogel patch demonstrates great potential for the treatment of oral ulcerations.",

        "Title": "Crop Production and Security in Ningjin County of the North China Plain.",
        "Abstract": "Stable growth in grain production is a critical challenge to ensure food security in North China Plain (NCP), an area dominated by smallholder farming. Food production and security of NCP largely depend on how smallholders farm their land. This study took Ningjin County of the NCP as an example to describe the characteristics of crop planting structure and the changes in crop production based on household surveys, statistics, various documents, and literature by descriptive statistics, calculation of crop self-sufficiency, and curve fitting, and aimed to reveal crop security and the influencing factors of crop production at the household level. The results were as follows: (1) Wheat and maize sown area accounted for 61.69% and 47.96% of the total sown area of crops during 2000-2020, increasing at a rate of 3.42% and 5.93%, respectively. Their planted areas increased from 27.52% and 15.54% in 2000 to 47.82% and 44.75% in 2020, respectively. (2) The self-sufficiency rate of maize showed a significant upward trend and reached its peak in 2019. the self-sufficiency rate of wheat also showed an increasing trend, from 192.87% to 617.37%, which indicates that wheat and maize can meet food self-sufficiency and the per capita grain yield is in a safe state. (3) The trends on wheat yield and fertilizer initially grew, then decreased, closely resembling an inverted \"U\", while the maize yield showed a pattern of increasing first and then basically remaining stable, similar to an \"S\" shape. A turning point for fertilizer use (550 kg/ha) was identified, indicating the limits of fertilizer use to increase yield. The national agricultural production and environmental protection policies, continuous improvement of crop varieties, as well as the farmers' traditional practices have significant impacts on crop production. This study will enhance management practices for improved yield, which can support the integrated management of agricultural production in intensive agricultural areas.",

Data suggests that the breastmilk profile, and more specifically human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) composition, differ by maternal HIV status and may partly help explain this increased risk. We are currently conducting an HMO-based synbiotic randomized trial in breastfed children HEU, the MIGH-T MO study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05282485), to assess the impact on health outcomes of children HEU.

        "Abstract": "The main bottlenecks limiting the practical application of primary explosives are the contradiction between safety and detonation performance, as well as the inherent brittleness of powder charge. Traditional methods to improve sensitivity performance such as adding carbon nanomaterials or embedding metal-organic framework (MOF) structure methods are mostly powders, which are inherently brittle and unsafe. Here, we report three types of typical azide aerogels that can be directly prepared and obtained in this paper by combining electrospinning with aerogel. Their electrostatic sensitivity and flame sensitivity were significantly improved and could be detonated successfully at an initiation voltage of 25 V, demonstrating good ignition performance. This enhancement is primarily due to the porous carbon skeleton structure evolved from a three-dimensional nanofiber aerogel, which has good thermal and electrical conductivity characteristics and can also uniformly load azide particles, contributing to improved explosive system sensitivity. The most important aspect of this method is that it can directly prepare molded explosives, which can be matched with the micro-electrical-mechanical system (MEMS) process, and it offers a new idea for the preparation of high-security molded explosives.",

        "Abstract": "Speech emotion recognition is challenging due to the subjectivity and ambiguity of emotion. In recent years, multimodal methods for speech emotion recognition have achieved promising results. However, due to the heterogeneity of data from different modalities, effectively integrating different modal information remains a difficulty and breakthrough point of the research. Moreover, in view of the limitations of feature-level fusion and decision-level fusion methods, capturing fine-grained modal interactions has often been neglected in previous studies. We propose a method named multimodal transformer augmented fusion that uses a hybrid fusion strategy, combing feature-level fusion and model-level fusion methods, to perform fine-grained information interaction within and between modalities. A Model-fusion module composed of three Cross-Transformer Encoders is proposed to generate multimodal emotional representation for modal guidance and information fusion. Specifically, the multimodal features obtained by feature-level fusion and text features are used to enhance speech features. Our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on the IEMOCAP and MELD dataset.",

        "Abstract": "Cognitive impairment is the most common complication in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis. There is no effective treatment for cognitive impairment. Medial septum cholinergic neurons have been reported to be a potential target for controlling epileptic seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy. However, their role in the cognitive impairment of temporal lobe epilepsy remains unclear. In this study, we found that patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis had a low memory quotient and severe impairment in verbal memory, but had no impairment in nonverbal memory. The cognitive impairment was slightly correlated with reduced medial septum volume and medial septum-hippocampus tracts measured by diffusion tensor imaging. In a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy induced by kainic acid, the number of medial septum cholinergic neurons was reduced and acetylcholine release was reduced in the hippocampus. Furthermore, selective apoptosis of medial septum cholinergic neurons mimicked the cognitive deficits in epileptic mice, and activation of medial septum cholinergic neurons enhanced hippocampal acetylcholine release and restored cognitive function in both kainic acid- and kindling-induced epilepsy models. These results suggest that activation of medial septum cholinergic neurons reduces cognitive deficits in temporal lobe epilepsy by increasing acetylcholine release via projections to the hippocampus.",

        "Abstract": "Domain generalization (DG) is one of the critical issues for deep learning in unknown domains. How to effectively represent domain-invariant context (DIC) is a difficult problem that DG needs to solve. Transformers have shown the potential to learn generalized features, since the powerful ability to learn global context. In this article, a novel method named patch diversity Transformer (PDTrans) is proposed to improve the DG for scene segmentation by learning global multidomain semantic relations. Specifically, patch photometric perturbation (PPP) is proposed to improve the representation of multidomain in the global context information, which helps the Transformer learn the relationship between multiple domains. Besides, patch statistics perturbation (PSP) is proposed to model the feature statistics of patches under different domain shifts, which enables the model to encode domain-invariant semantic features and improve generalization. PPP and PSP can help to diversify the source domain at the patch level and feature level. PDTrans learns context across diverse patches and takes advantage of self-attention to improve DG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the tremendous performance advantages of the PDTrans over state-of-the-art DG methods.",

        "Abstract": "The surface displacement and deformation of goaf caused by coal mining destroy the underground rock structure and surface ecological environment in the mining area and endanger the safety of human life and property. An accurate and efficient dynamic prediction system of mining subsidence is indispensable. Given the limited scope of the application of the probability integral model on the edge of the mobile basin, its poor prediction effect, and its low accuracy, a new mining subsidence prediction model based on the Boltzmann function is proposed. Combined with the transformed normal distribution time function, a B-normal prediction model that can predict the dynamic displacement and deformation of any point on the surface was constructed. The global optimal solution of the parameters of the dynamic prediction model was inversed by introducing particle swarm optimization shuffled frog leaping intelligent algorithm (PSO-SFLA), and then, the model was applied to the 8102 working face of the Guobei coal mine to dynamically predict the subsidence, inclination, curvature, horizontal displacement, and horizontal deformation of the goaf surface. The prediction results showed that on the strike and dip observation lines, the prediction accuracy of the dynamic subsidence and horizontal displacement of the surface could reach the centimeter level, the predicted root mean square error (RMSE) of dynamic tilt and horizontal deformation was less than 0.51 mm/m, and the predicted RMSE of dynamic curvature was within 0.020 mm/m",

        "Abstract": "Given the development of the digital economy, the shift to digitalization is an inevitable direction for corporate strategic planning. This empirical study investigates the impact of corporate digital strategic orientation on innovation output. It also examines the moderating effects of executive equity and compensation incentives on the relationship between corporate digital strategic orientation and innovation output. We selected a sample of Chinese listed companies and adopted the Heckman two-stage and two-stage least square (2\u00a0S\u00a0LS) methods to control for potential endogenous problems. Our findings indicate that corporate digital strategic orientation significantly enhances innovation output. Additionally, we found that executive compensation and equity incentives positively moderate the impact of corporate digital strategic orientation on innovation output, with equity incentives having a greater moderating effect than compensation incentives. Further analysis shows that the impact of corporate digital strategic orientation on innovation output is greater in non-manufacturing industries and non-state-owned enterprises. Our study provides policy insights on how companies can enhance their innovation capability in the digital economy.",

As the major components of insect cuticle, the diverse structural cuticle proteins (CPs) contribute to variation in physical properties and functions of cuticle. However, the roles of CPs in cuticular versatility, especially in the stress response or adaption, remain incompletely understood. In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of CP superfamily in the rice-boring pest Chilosuppressalis. A total of 211 CP genes were identified and their encoding proteins were classified into eleven families and three subfamilies (RR1, RR2, and RR3). The comparative genomic analysis of CPs revealed that C. suppressalis had fewer CP genes compared to other lepidopteran species, which largely resulted from a less expansion of his-rich RR2 genes involved in cuticular sclerotization, suggesting long-term boring life of C. suppressalis inside rice hosts might evolutionarily prefer cuticular elasticity rather than cuticular sclerotization. We also investigated the response pattern of all CP genes under insecticidal stresses. >50\u00a0% CsCPs were upregulated at least 2-fold under insecticidal stresses. Notably, the majority of the highly upregulated CsCPs formed gene pairs or gene clusters on chromosomes, indicating the rapid response of adjacent CsCPs to insecticidal stress. Most high-response CsCPs encoded AAPA/V/L motifs that are related to cuticular elasticity and >50\u00a0% of the sclerotization-related his-rich RR2 genes were also upregulated. These results suggested the potential roles of CsCPs in balancing the elasticity and sclerotization of cuticles, which is essential for the survival and adaptation of plant borers including C. suppressalis. Our study provides valuable information for further developing cuticle-based strategies of both pest management and biomimetic applications.",

        "Abstract": "The round-robin differential phase shift (RRDPS) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol is the only one that does not require monitoring of signal disturbance. Moreover, it has been proven that RRDPS has excellent performance of resistance to finite-key effects and high error rate tolerance. However, the existing theories and experiments do not take the afterpulse effects into account, which cannot be neglected in high-speed QKD systems. Here, we propose a tight finite-key analysis with afterpulse effects. The results show that the non-Markovian afterpulse RRDPS model optimizes the system performance considering afterpulse effects. The advantage of RRDPS over decoy-state BB84 under short-time communication still holds at typical values of afterpulse.",

However, current drugs and measures for the prevention and treatment of sepsis have little effect. Sepsis-associated acute liver injury (SALI) is an independent risk factor for sepsis, which seriously affects the prognosis of sepsis. Studies have found that gut microbiota is closely related to SALI, and indole-3-propionic Acid (IPA) can activate Pregnane X receptor (PXR). However, the role of IPA and PXR in SALI has not been reported.",

        "Title": "Targeting lactate metabolism and immune interaction in breast tumor via protease-triggered delivery.",
        "Abstract": "Lactate is abundant in cancer tissues due to active glycolysis (aka Warburg effect) and mediates crosstalk between tumor cells and the immune microenvironment (TIME) to promote the progression of breast cancer. Quercetin (QU) is a potent monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) inhibitor, which can reduce lactate production and secretion of tumor cells. Doxorubicin (DOX) can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), which promotes tumor-specific immune activation. Thus, we propose a combination therapy of QU&DOX to inhibit lactate metabolism and stimulate anti-tumor immunity. To enhance tumor-targeting efficiency, we developed a legumain-activatable liposome system (KC26-Lipo) with modification of KC26 peptide for co-delivery of QU&DOX for modulation of tumor metabolism and TIME in breast cancer. The KC26 peptide is a legumain-responsive, hairpin-structured cell-penetrating peptide (polyarginine) derivative. Legumain is a protease overexpressed in breast tumors, allowing selective activation of the KC26-Lipo to subsequently facilitate intra-tumoral and intracellular penetration. The KC26-Lipo effectively inhibited 4T1 breast cancer tumor growth through chemotherapy and anti-tumor immunity. Besides, inhibition of lactate metabolism suppressed the HIF-1\u03b1/VEGF pathway and angiogenesis and repolarized the tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). This work provides a promising breast cancer therapy strategy by regulating lactate metabolism and TIME.",

        "Abstract": "Seizures due to cortical dysplasia are notorious for their poor prognosis even with medications and surgery, likely due to the widespread seizure network. Previous studies have primarily focused on the disruption of dysplastic lesions, rather than remote regions such as the hippocampus. Here, we first quantified the epileptogenicity of the hippocampus in patients with late-stage cortical dysplasia. We further investigated the cellular substrates leading to the epileptic hippocampus, using multiscale tools including calcium imaging, optogenetics, immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology. For the first time, we revealed the role of hippocampal somatostatin-positive interneurons in cortical dysplasia-related seizures. Somatostatin-positive were recruited during cortical dysplasia-related seizures. Interestingly, optogenetic studies suggested that somatostatin-positive interneurons paradoxically facilitated seizure generalization. By contrast, parvalbumin-positive interneurons retained an inhibitory role as in controls. Electrophysiological recordings and immunohistochemical studies revealed glutamate-mediated excitatory transmission from somatostatin-positive interneurons in the dentate gyrus. Taken together, our study reveals a novel role of excitatory somatostatin-positive neurons in the seizure network and brings new insights into the cellular basis of cortical dysplasia.",

        "Abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomics is rapidly advancing our understanding of the composition of complex tissues and biological cells, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) holds great potential for identifying and characterizing the cell composition of complex tissues. Cell type identification by analyzing scRNA-seq data is mostly limited by time-consuming and irreproducible manual annotation. As scRNA-seq technology scales to thousands of cells per experiment, the exponential increase in the number of cell samples makes manual annotation more difficult. On the other hand, the sparsity of gene transcriptome data remains a major challenge. This paper applied the idea of the transformer to single-cell classification tasks based on scRNA-seq data. We propose scTransSort, a cell-type annotation method pretrained with single-cell transcriptomics data. The scTransSort incorporates a method of representing genes as gene expression embedding blocks to reduce the sparsity of data used for cell type identification and reduce the computational complexity. The feature of scTransSort is that its implementation of intelligent information extraction for unordered data, automatically extracting valid features of cell types without the need for manually labeled features and additional references. In experiments on cells from 35 human and 26 mouse tissues, scTransSort successfully elucidated its high accuracy and high performance for cell type identification, and demonstrated its own high robustness and generalization ability.",

        "Title": "Non-invasive activation of intratumoural gene editing for improved adoptive T-cell therapy in solid tumours.",
        "Abstract": "Adoptive T-cell therapy against solid tumours is limited by the apoptosis resistance mechanisms of tumour cells and by the extracellular, immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. Here we report a temperature-sensitive genome-editing nanodevice that can deliver a Cas9 editor with an external trigger which can be used to edit the genome of tumour cells to reduce resistance to apoptosis and modulate the tumour microenvironment via a mild heating trigger. After local or systemic delivery of Cas9, mild heating is induced by non-invasive near-infrared (NIR) light or focused ultrasound (FUS) to activate Cas9, which initiates simultaneous genome editing of HSP70 (HSPA1A) and BAG3 in tumour cells. This disrupts the apoptotic resistance machinery of the tumour cells against adoptive T cells. At the same time, an NIR- or FUS-induced mild thermal effect reshapes the extracellular tumour microenvironment by disrupting the physical barriers and immune suppression. This facilitates the infiltration of adoptive T cells and enhances their therapeutic activity. Mild thermal Cas9 delivery is demonstrated in different murine tumour models which mimic a range of clinical indications, including a tumour model based on humanized patient-derived xenografts. As a result, the non-invasive thermal delivery of Cas9 significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacies of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and chimeric antigen receptor T and shows potential for clinical application.",

        "Abstract": "Skin aging is a complex process involving intricate genetic and environmental factors. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional regulatory landscape of skin aging in canines. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was employed to identify aging-related gene modules. We subsequently validated the expression changes of these module genes in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of human aging skin. Notably, basal cell (BC), spinous cell (SC), mitotic cell (MC), and fibroblast (FB) were identified as the cell types with the most significant gene expression changes during aging. By integrating GENIE3 and RcisTarget, we constructed gene regulation networks (GRNs) for aging-related modules and identified core transcription factors (TFs) by intersecting significantly enriched TFs within the GRNs with hub TFs from WGCNA analysis, revealing key regulators of skin aging. Furthermore, we demonstrated the conserved role of CTCF and RAD21 in skin aging using an H",

        "Title": "First Report of Calystegia hederacea as a new host of sweet potato leaf curl Hubei virus.",
        "Abstract": "Calystegia hederacea (Convolvulaceae) is one of the most problematic perennial weeds widely distributed around or in crop fields. Our previous studies showed that C. hederacea is natural reservoir of sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus isolate CH (SPCSV-CH) and sweet potato latent virus (SPLV) (Liu et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2022). To shed further light on the role of C. hederacea in the epidemiology of sweet potato viruses, in May 2021, a total of seven C. hederacea plants (five asymptomatic, one curling and one mild vein-clearing) were collected from two different sweet potato fields in Xinxiang city of Henan Province in China. Total RNA was prepared from a pool of the seven leaf samples using the EZNA Plant RNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA). A library was constructed from the ribosomal-depleted RNA using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, MA, USA) and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform (Novogene, Tianjin, China). A total of 139,057,020 paired-end clean reads of 150 bp were obtained after removing adaptor sequences and low-quality reads and used for de novo assembly using the Trinity (v2.2.0) software. Blast searches of the assembled contigs longer than 200 bp against NCBI nucleotide and protein sequence databases revealed the presence of 37 contigs (237 to 4885 bp) and 19 contigs (261 to 758 bp) with high nucleotide (nt) identity with SPLV and SPCSV-CH, respectively. The occurrence of SPLV and SPCSV-CH on C. hederacea was previously reported, and thus the contig sequences related to SPLV and SPCSV-CH were not subjected to further verification in this study. In addition, one contig (2,827 bp) with the highest nt sequence identity of 94.94% with sweet potato leaf curl Hubei virus (SPLCHbV, genus Begomovirus, family Geminiviridae, accession no. MK931304) was assembled from 16,592 reads, with average coverage depth of 740.5X. These results suggested the presence of SPLCHbV in C. hederacea. To further confirm the RNA sequencing result, each of the seven samples was tested by PCR using partially overlapping (italicized nucleotides) forward and reverse primers (SweeIn-F1, 5`-GGAGGAAGCTAAGTACGAGAATCAGTTAGAG-3`; SweeIn-R1, 5`-GCTTCCTCCTTGTGATTGTAAGTAACATGG-3`) that were designed based on the SPLCHbV-related contig for amplification of circular DNA viral genome (approximately 2.7 kb). Two symptomatic and three symptomless C. hederacea samples were SPLCHbV positive, indicating that virus-like symptoms of the two C. hederacea samples were probably not induced by SPLCHbV. Two of the five amplified products were completely sequenced and deposited to GenBank (accession nos. OQ551733 and OQ551734). Sequences analysis showed that the complete genome sequences of two SPLCHbV C. headrace isolates (2,763 nt and 2,761 nt) had 96.53% nt identity with each other and 95.92 to 97.70% nt identity with that of SPLCHbV isolate Shandong7-2017 (MK931304). In August 2021, fourteen C. hederacea plants (three symptomatic, 11 asymptomatic) collected from natural fields from Zhumadian and Pingdingshan cities in Henan Province, were tested by PCR using SweeIn-F1/R1 primers for SPLCHbV, showing that eight samples were SPLCHbV positive. SPLCHbV belongs to the sweepoviruses, a group of phylogenetically distinct begomoviruses infecting sweet potato, and was reported to infect sweet potato from many provinces of China (Wang et al., 2021). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of SPLCHbV infection in C. hederacea, which expands the natural host range of SPLCHbV.",

        "Abstract": "Two new RNA viruses were identified in Ageratum conyzoides in China using high-throughput sequencing, and their genome sequences were determined using PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The new viruses, which have positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes, were provisionally named \"ageratum virus 1\" (AgV1) and \"ageratum virus 2\" (AgV2). AgV1 has a genome of 3,526 nucleotides with three open reading frames (ORFs) and shares 49.9% nucleotide sequence identity with the complete genome of Ethiopian tobacco bushy top virus (genus Umbravirus, family Tombusviridae). The genome of AgV2 consists of 5,523 nucleotides and contains five ORFs that are commonly observed in members of the genus Enamovirus of the family Solemoviridae. Proteins encoded by AgV2 exhibited the highest amino acid sequence similarity (31.7-75.0% identity) to the corresponding proteins of pepper enamovirus R1 (an unclassified enamovirus) and citrus vein enation virus (genus Enamovirus). Based on their genome organization, sequence, and phylogenetic relationships, AgV1 is proposed to be a new umbra-like virus of the family Tombusviridae, and AgV2 is proposed to be a new member of the genus Enamovirus of the family Solemoviridae.",

        "Abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus often leads to severe skin infections. However, S. aureus is facing a crisis of antibiotic resistance. The combination of phage and antibiotics is effective for drug-resistant S. aureus infections. Therefore, it is worth exploiting novel antibacterial agents to cooperate with antibiotics against S. aureus infections. Herein, a novel chimeric lysin ClyQ was constructed, which was composed of a cysteine- and histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase (CHAP) catalytic domain from S. aureus phage lysin LysGH15 and cell wall-binding domain (CBD) from Enterococcus faecalis phage lysin PlyV12. ClyQ had an exceptionally broad host range targeting streptococci, staphylococci, E. faecalis, and ",
