        "Title": "Lysine methylation modifications in tumor immunomodulation and immunotherapy: regulatory mechanisms and perspectives.",
        "Abstract": "Lysine methylation is a crucial post-translational modification (PTM) that significantly impacts gene expression regulation. This modification not only influences cancer development directly but also has significant implications for the immune system. Lysine methylation modulates immune cell functions and shapes the anti-tumor immune response, highlighting its dual role in both tumor progression and immune regulation. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the intrinsic role of lysine methylation in the activation and function of immune cells, detailing how these modifications affect cellular processes and signaling pathways. We delve into the mechanisms by which lysine methylation contributes to tumor immune evasion, allowing cancer cells to escape immune surveillance and thrive. Furthermore, we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting lysine methylation in cancer immunotherapy. Emerging strategies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, are being explored for their efficacy in modulating lysine methylation to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. By targeting these modifications, we can potentially improve the effectiveness of existing treatments and develop novel therapeutic approaches to combat cancer more effectively.",

Cuproptosis is a recently proposed method of cell death in 2022, and it is different from any previously reported method. The principle is that copper ions lead to aggregation and instability of intracellular proteins. An increasing number of researchers are dedicated to enriching the mechanism of cuproptosis and exploring its relationship with cancer. Studies have found that intracellular copper levels have an impact on the occurrence and development of lymphoma. The complexity of lymphoma and the limitations of treatment necessitate in-depth studies of the disease. We will review the mechanism of cuproptosis and its potential in lymphoma therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is characterized by rapid onset and high chance of metastasis. Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets is imperative. E26 transformation-specific homologous factor (EHF), a member of the E26 transformation-specific transcription factor family, plays a pivotal role in epithelial cell differentiation and cancer progression. However, its precise role in CCA remains unclear. In this study, through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that EHF plays a profound role in promoting CCA by transcriptional activation of glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1). Moreover, EHF significantly recruited and activated tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through the C-C motif chemokine 2/C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCL2/CCR2) axis, thereby remodeling the tumor microenvironment. In human CCA tissues, EHF expression was positively correlated with GLI1 and CCL2 expression, and patients with co-expression of EHF/GLI1 or EHF/CCL2 had the most adverse prognosis. Furthermore, the combination of the GLI1 inhibitor, GANT58, and CCR2 inhibitor, INCB3344, substantially reduced the occurrence of EHF-mediated CCA. In summary, our findings suggest that EHF is a potential prognostic biomarker for patients with CCA, while also advocating the therapeutic approach of combined targeting of GLI1 and CCL2/CCR2-TAMs to inhibit EHF-driven CCA development.",

        "Title": "Myeloid-derived suppressor cells in cancer: therapeutic targets to overcome tumor immune evasion.",
        "Abstract": "Paradoxically, tumor development and progression can be inhibited and promoted by the immune system. After three stages of immune editing, namely, elimination, homeostasis and escape, tumor cells are no longer restricted by immune surveillance and thus develop into clinical tumors. The mechanisms of immune escape include abnormalities in antitumor-associated immune cells, selection for immune resistance to tumor cells, impaired transport of T cells, and the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. A population of distinct immature myeloid cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), mediate immune escape primarily by exerting immunosuppressive effects and participating in the constitution of an immunosuppressive microtumor environment. Clinical trials have found that the levels of MDSCs in the peripheral blood of cancer patients are strongly correlated with tumor stage, metastasis and prognosis. Moreover, animal experiments have confirmed that elimination of MDSCs inhibits tumor growth and metastasis to some extent. Therefore, MDSCs may become the target of immunotherapy for many cancers, and eliminating MDSCs can help improve the response rate to cancer treatment and patient survival. However, a clear definition of MDSCs and the specific mechanism involved in immune escape are lacking. In this paper, we review the role of the MDSCs population in tumor development and the mechanisms involved in immune escape in different tumor contexts. In addition, we discuss the use of these cells as targets for tumor immunotherapy. This review not only contributes to a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the essential role of MDSCs in immune system reactions against tumors but also provides information to guide the development of cancer therapies targeting MDSCs.",

        "Abstract": "The use of biochar for soil improvement and emission reduction has been widely recognized for its excellent performance. However, the choice of feedstock and pyrolysis temperature for biochar production significantly affects its surface parameters and interactions with soil substances. In this study, we retrieved 465 peer-reviewed papers on the application of biochar in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient losses in soil and analyzed the changes in biochar physicochemical parameters from different feedstock and pyrolytic temperatures. Molecular simulation computing technology was also used to explore the impacts of these changes on the interaction between biochar and soil substances. The statistical results from the peer-reviewed papers indicated that biochar derived from wood-based feedstock exhibits superior physical characteristics, such as increased porosity and specific surface area. Conversely, biochar derived from straw-based feedstock was found to contain excellent element content, such as O, N, and H, and biochar derived from straw and produced at low pyrolysis temperatures contains a significant number of functional groups that enhance the charge transfer potential and adsorption stability by increasing surface charge density, charge distribution and bonding orbitals. However, it should be noted that this enhancement may also activate certain recalcitrant C compounds and promote biochar decomposition. Taken together, these results have significant implications for biochar practitioners when selecting suitable feedstock and pyrolysis temperatures based on agricultural needs and increasing their understanding of the interaction mechanism between biochar and soil substances.",

ABCC1 has been shown to be associated with the growth, progression, and drug resistance of various types of cancer. However, the impact of ABCC1 on cancer immune infiltration and pan-cancer prognosis has been rarely studied. Our comprehensive pan-cancer analysis unveiled elevated ABCC1 expression across various cancers. ABCC1 overexpression consistently predicted unfavorable outcomes based on TCGA data. Moreover, ABCC1 expression exhibited intricate associations with diverse immune-related genes and demonstrated a close correlation with immune scores across multiple tumor types. Analysis of scRNA-seq data from the GEO database revealed that the expression of ABCC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells is significant positively correlated with macrophage infiltration. Furthermore, various in vitro and in vivo experiments substantiated the role of ABCC1 in promoting the progression of HCC, along with increased macrophage recruitment. Based on the results, we propose ABCC1 as a potentially valuable prognostic indicator and a prospective target for immune-based cancer therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, a significant proportion of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients fail to respond to conventional drug therapy such as immunosuppressants and biologic agents. Interference with the JAK/STAT pathway and blocking of IL-1 signaling are two promising therapeutic strategies for these unresponsive IBD patients. This work describes the discovery of an inhibitor 10v that not only blocks NLRP3 and AIM-2 inflammasome-mediated IL-1\u03b2 signaling, but also reduces the expression of STAT1 and STAT5 in the JAK/STAT pathway. Importantly, 10v exhibits a significant anti-IL-1\u03b2 effect and decreases the levels of STAT1 and STAT5 in a mouse model of colitis. As a result, a novel small molecule is identified with a dual inhibitory capacity towards both inflammasomes/IL-1\u03b2 and STAT pathways, which supports further exploration of the therapeutic potential for IBD patients that do not respond to current drug therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Deterioration of neurovascular conditions can be rapid in patients with spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and often lead to poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is crucial to promptly assess and continually track the progression of the disease. This study incorporated baseline clinical conditions, repeatedly measured neurological grades and haematological biomarkers for dynamic outcome prediction in patients with spontaneous SAH. Neurological intervention, mainly aneurysm clipping and endovascular embolisation, was also incorporated as an intermediate event in developing a neurological intervention transition (NIT) joint model. A retrospective cohort study was performed on 701 patients in spontaneous SAH with a study period of 14\u00a0days from the MIMIC-IV dataset. A dynamic prognostic model predicting outcome of patients was developed based on combination of Cox model and piecewise linear mixed-effect models to incorporate different types of prognostic information. Clinical baseline covariates, including cerebral oedema, cerebral infarction, respiratory failure, hydrocephalus and vasospasm, as well as repeated measured Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), glucose and white blood cell (WBC) levels were covariates contributing to the optimal model. Incorporation of neurological intervention as an intermediate event increases the prediction performance compared with baseline joint modelling approach. The average AUC of the optimal model proposed in this study is 0.7783 across different starting points of prediction and prediction intervals. The model proposed in this study can provide dynamic prognosis for spontaneous SAH patients and significant potential benefits in critical care management.",

        "Abstract": "To investigate the conversion of carbon and nitrogen organic matter to humus mediated by mineral material additives through biotic and abiotic pathways, three chicken manure composting experiments were conducted using calcium superphosphate (CS) and fly ash (FA). Results showed that CS and FA promoted carbon and nitrogen organic degradation and improved compost maturity. The ratio of humic acid-like to fulvic acid-like substances for FA (30) was significantly higher than for control (18) and CS (13). Excitation-emission-matrix spectra and parallel factor analysis identified a higher transformation of protein-like components into humic-like components in FA. Network analysis showed that CS improved compost maturity by promoting the rapid conversion of humus precursors to humus, while FA increased the richness and diversity of the microbial community, such as Chloroflexi, the unique phylum in FA. Overall, CS and FA facilitated the humification process through abiotic and biotic pathways, and FA had better humification performance.",

        "Title": "Total Lipid Extracts of Honeybee Drone Larvae Are Modulated by Extraction Temperature and Display Consistent Anti-Inflammatory Potential.",
        "Abstract": "Honeybee drone larvae are male bees that develop from unfertilized eggs and play a role in colony reproduction. The nutritional value of honeybee drone larvae is due to their high protein, lipid, and other nutrient contents, making them a profitable food source for humans in some cultures. Drone larvae lipids (DLLs) contribute to drone development; however, few studies have explored their substantial compositions and bioactive functions. In this study, we carried out DLL lipidomics analysis using UPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS prior to in vitro anti-inflammatory activity analysis. The results highlighted the importance of the extraction temperature on the DLL composition. A total of 21 lipids were found in the DLL extract, mostly categorized into five groups: nine phospholipids, three sphingolipids, two neutral lipids, one plant glycoglycerolipid, four lipid acyl, and others. Drying extraction at -20 \u00b0C produced more sphingolipids, phospholipids, and unsaturated fatty acids. Of 37 fatty acids, 18 were displayed at -20 \u00b0C degrees, as shown by GC-MS quantitative analysis. Myristic (246.99 \u00b1 13.19 \u03bcg/g), palmitic (1707.87 \u00b1 60.53 \u03bcg/g), stearic (852.32 \u00b1 24.17 \u03bcg/g), and oleic (2463.03 \u00b1 149.61 \u03bcg/g) acids were the predominant fatty acids. Furthermore, we examined the significant in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of DLL (-20 \u00b0C) using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged RAW264.7 cells. Nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen (ROS) production and mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-10, COX-2, and iNOS were significantly decreased, demonstrating the anti-inflammatory function of DLL. Overall, this study provided insight into the lipid composition of DLL, revealed the influence of temperature, and explored the functionality of DLL (-20 \u00b0C), allowing for further application of DLLs as functional foods.",

        "Abstract": "Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) has a high mortality rate and lacks effective targeted treatment. We applied lipopolysaccharides-induced injury models in human and mouse renal tubular epithelial cells, and at the same time, we selected a commonly used sedative drug, dexmedetomidine, to investigate its potential for renal protection. We found a significant increase in the expression level of HSP90, and the interaction with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) led to autophagic degradation of GPX4, triggering ferroptosis. Dexmedetomidine reduced the degradation of GPX4 by increasing the binding of KEAP1 and HSP90 in the cytoplasm. Therefore, lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis were reduced. Similarly, dexmedetomidine showed renal protective effects in C57BL/6J male mice with SA-AKI induced by cecal ligation. Our study reveals a new mechanism of renal tubular epithelial cell ferroptosis in SA-AKI treated with dexmedetomidine.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive human malignancies worldwide. However, the molecular mechanism of HCC metastasis is largely unknown. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a key role in gene regulation, and dysregulation of lncRNA is critical to cancer metastasis. LINC01980 has been reported in ESCC recently, but the mechanism underlying its function in HCC is still unknown. In this study, we found that LINC01980 was upregulated and associated with notably poor overall survival in HCC patients. Functionally, LINC01980 played a carcinogenic role and promoted HCC metastasis. Mechanically, LINC01980 enhanced the E2F5 expression via competitively binding miR-376b-5p, thereby inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promoting HCC cells migration and invasion. In addition, LINC01980-mediated HCC cells metastasis was dependent on E2F5. What's more, TGF-\u03b2 activated LINC01980 transcription through the canonical TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway in HCC. In conclusion, LINC01980, activated by the canonical TGF-\u03b2/SMAD pathway, promoted HCC metastasis via miR-376b-5p/E2F5 axis. Therefore, LINC01980 might be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of HCC.",

Hence, novel therapeutic strategies that target LSCs are crucial for treatment success. We investigated if targeting Bcl-2 and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), two distinct cell survival regulating mechanisms could eliminate LSCs. This study demonstrate that the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax combined with the PPAR\u03b1 agonist chiglitazar resulted in synergistic killing of LSC-like cell lines and CD34",

        "Abstract": "Laser-scribed graphene (LSG), a promising electrode material has attracted special research interest in recent years. Here, the fabricating process-electrochemical property correlation of laser-scribed graphene (LSG) devices was discussed emphatically and a pertinent optimization was performed to achieve better electroanalytical performance. Experiment results indicated that the laser scribing technique possessed great process latitude and reducing laser power and scribing speed facilitated fabricating high-quality graphene electrodes. Benefiting from its binder-free 3D porous network structure and high active/geometric area ratio, the optimized LSG electrode was superior to the screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) on electrochemical performance in the [Fe(CN)",

        "Abstract": "3,4-bis(3-nitrofurazan-4-yl)furoxan\u00a0(DNTF) is a new energetic compound with high energy and high density, and it is an important component of propellant and melt cast explosive. In order to study the effect of solvent on the growth morphology of DNTF, the growth plane of DNTF in vacuum is predicted by attachment energy\u00a0(AE) model, and then the modified attachment energy of each growth plane in different solvents is calculated by molecular dynamics simulation. The morphology of crystal in solvent is predicted by modified attachment energy (MAE) model. The factors affecting crystal growth in solvent environment are analyzed by mass density distribution, radial distribution function and diffusion coefficient. The results show that the growth morphology of crystal in solvent is not only related to the adsorption strength of solvent to crystal plane, but affected by the attraction of crystal plane to solute. The hydrogen bond plays an important role in the adsorption strength between solvent and crystal plane. The polarity of solvent has a great influence on the crystal morphology, and the interaction between the solvent with stronger polarity and the crystal plane is stronger. The morphology of DNTF in n-butanol solvent is closer to spherical, which can effectively reduce the sensitivity of DNTF.",

        "Abstract": "Bone is the second leading metastatic site for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with HCC and bone metastasis suffer poor quality of life and reduced survival time. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are widely involved in HCC formation and metastasis. However, the communication between primary HCC and bone lesions mediated by EVs remains unclear and the possible effect of bone metastasis on the progression of HCC remains largely unknown. Here, bone-metastasized HCC-derived EVs (BM-EVs) are found to localize to orthotropic HCC cells and promote HCC progression. Mechanistically, miR-3190-5p (miR-3190) is upregulated in intracellular HCC cells isolated from bone lesions as well as in their derived EVs. miR-3190 in BM-EVs is transferred into orthotopic tumor cells and enhances their metastatic capacity by downregulating AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) expression. Decreased level of ALKBH5 exacerbates the prometastatic characteristics of HCC by modulating gene expression in N6-methyladenosine-dependent and -independent ways. Finally, antagomir-miR-3190-loaded liposomes with HCC affinity successfully suppress HCC progression in mice treated with BM-EVs. These findings reveal that BM-EVs initiate prometastatic cascades in orthotopic HCC by transferring ALKBH5-targeting miR-3190 and miR-3190 is serving as a promising therapeutic target for inhibiting the progression of HCC in patients with bone metastasis.",

        "Abstract": "This article presents a novel method for face clustering in videos using a video-centralised transformer. Previous works often employed contrastive learning to learn frame-level representation and used average pooling to aggregate the features along the temporal dimension. This approach may not fully capture the complicated video dynamics. In addition, despite the recent progress in video-based contrastive learning, few have attempted to learn a self-supervised clustering-friendly face representation that benefits the video face clustering task. To overcome these limitations, our method employs a transformer to directly learn video-level representations that can better reflect the temporally-varying property of faces in videos, while we also propose a video-centralised self-supervised framework to train the transformer model. We also investigate face clustering in egocentric videos, a fast-emerging field that has not been studied yet in works related to face clustering. To this end, we present and release the first large-scale egocentric video face clustering dataset named EasyCom-Clustering. We evaluate our proposed method on both the widely used Big Bang Theory (BBT) dataset and the new EasyCom-Clustering dataset. Results show the performance of our video-centralised transformer has surpassed all previous state-of-the-art methods on both benchmarks, exhibiting a self-attentive understanding of face videos.",

        "Abstract": "Photoperiod is an important environmental cue interacting with circadian clock pathway to optimize the local adaption and yield of crops. Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) in family Amaranthaceae has been known as superfood due to the nutritious elements. As quinoa was originated from the low-latitude Andes, most of the quinoa accessions are short-day type. Short-day type quinoa usually displays altered growth and yield status when introduced into higher latitude regions. Thus, deciphering the photoperiodic regulation on circadian clock pathway will help breed adaptable and high yielding quinoa cultivars.",

        "Abstract": "Treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with chemotherapeutic agents fails to eliminate leukemia stem cells (LSC)\uff0cand thus patients remain at high risk for relapse. Therefore, the identification of agents that target LSC is an important consideration for the development of new therapies. Enhanced glycolysis in LSC contributes to the aggressiveness of AML, which is difficult to be targeted. In this study, we showed that targeting peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), a ligand-activated transcription factor by chiglitazar provided a promising therapeutic approach. We first identified that chiglitazar reduced cell viability and proliferation of the leukemia stem-like cells population in AML. Treatment with chiglitazar blocked the ubiquitination of PPAR\u03b1 and increased its expression, resulting in the inhibition of glucose metabolism and apoptosis of AML cells. Consistent with its anti-leukemia stem-like cells activity in vitro, chiglitazar treatment in vivo resulted in the significant killing of leukemia stem-like cells as demonstrated in AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Mechanistically, PPAR\u03b1 overexpression inhibited the expression and promoter activity of PGK1 through blocking HIF1-\u03b1 interaction on the PGK1 promoter. Thus, we concluded that targeting PPAR\u03b1 may serve as a novel approach for enhancing stem and progenitor cells elimination in AML.",

Recent studies indicate that RHO GTPases participate in the proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis of cancer, playing an essential role in the tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This review first introduces the classification, structure, regulators and functions of RHO GTPases, then dissects its role in HCC, especially in migration and metastasis. Finally, we summarize inhibitors targeting RHO GTPases and highlight the issues that should be addressed to improve the potency of these inhibitors.",

        "Abstract": "Learning-based surface reconstruction methods have received considerable attention in recent years due to their excellent expressiveness. However, existing learning-based methods lack scalability in processing large-scale point clouds. This paper proposes a novel scalable learning-based 3D surface reconstruction method based on octree, called SSRNet. SSRNet works in a scalable reconstruction pipeline, which divides oriented point clouds into different local parts and then processes them in parallel. Accommodating this scalable design pattern, SSRNet constructs local geometric features for octree vertices. Such features comprise the relation between the vertices and the implicit surface, ensuring geometric perception. Focusing on local geometric information also enables the network to avoid the overfitting problem and generalize well on different datasets. Finally, as a learning-based method, SSRNet can process large-scale point clouds in a short time. And to further solve the efficiency problem, we provide a lightweight and efficient version that is about five times faster while maintaining reconstruction performance. Experiments show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance with outstanding efficiency.",

Short-chain CPs (SCCPs) were classified as persistent organic pollutants under the Stockholm Convention in 2017. Medium-chain CPs (MCCPs) became candidate persistent organic pollutants in 2021. CPs are now ubiquitously found in the environment. Honey bees can be exposed to CPs during foraging, and this exposure subsequently results in the contamination of honey and other bee products along with colony food production and storage. Here, SCCP and MCCP concentrations in honey collected from Chinese apiaries in 2015 and 2021 were determined. Total CP concentrations in honey from 2021 to 2015 were comparable, but the ratio of MCCPs/SCCPs was higher in 2021 than in 2015. SCCP and MCCP congener group profiles in all honey samples were similar and dominated by C",

        "Abstract": "Limbal dermoid (LD) is a congenital ocular tumor that causes amblyopia and damages visual acuity (VA) and visual function. This study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of perceptual learning (PL) toward improving contrast sensitivity function (CSF) and VA. A total of 25 children with LD and 25 normal children were compared in terms of CSF and VA. The LD group was further randomly allocated into two arms: nine underwent PL combined with patching and eight underwent patching only; eight patients quit the amblyopia treatment. The primary outcome was the area under log CSF (AULCSF), and the secondary outcome was the best corrected VA (BCVA). The CSF was obviously reduced in the LD group compared with that in the normal group. Moreover, the difference in the changes in the AULCSF between the PL and patching groups after 6 months of training was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.86, p < 0.001), and the between-group difference in VA at 6 months was \u22120.30 (95% CI: \u22120.46, \u22120.14, p < 0.001). Children suffering from LD with amblyopia exhibited CSF deficits and VA loss simultaneously. PL could improve CSF and VA in the amblyopic eye better than patching.",

        "Abstract": "Manufacturing of porous carbon with biomass resources is intensively investigated in recent decades. The diversity of biomass species and great variety of processing methods enable the structural richness of porous carbon as well as their wide applications. This review specifically focuses on the structure of biomass-derived porous carbon either inherited from natural biomass or created by post-treatment. The intrinsic structure of plant biomass is briefly introduced and the utilization of the unique structures at different length-scales is discussed. In term of post-treatment, the structural features of activated carbon by traditional physical and chemical activation are summarized and compared in a wide spectrum of biomass species, statistical analysis is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of different activation methods in creating specific pore structures. The similar pore structure of biomass-derived carbon and coal-derived carbon suggests a promising replacement with more sustainable biomass resources in producing porous carbon. In summary, using biomass as porous carbon precursor endows the flexibility of using its naturally patterned microstructure and the tunability of controlled pore-creation by post-treatment.",

        "Abstract": "As a momentous energetic group, a nitro group widely exists in high-energy-density materials (HEDMs), such as trinitrotoluene (TNT), 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB), cyclo-1,3,5-trimethylene-2,4,6-trinitramine (RDX), etc. The nitro group has a significant effect on improving the oxygen balance and detonation performances of energetic materials (EMs). Moreover, the nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, and it can increase the acidity of the acidic hydrogen-containing nitrogen-rich energetic compounds to facilitate the construction of energetic ionic salts. Thus, it is possible to design nitro-nitrogen-rich energetic compounds with adjustable properties. In this paper, the nitration methods of azoles, including imidazole, pyrazole, triazole, tetrazole, and oxadiazole, as well as azines, including pyrazine, pyridazine, triazine, and tetrazine, have been concluded. Furthermore, the prospect of the future development of nitrogen-rich heterocyclic energetic compounds has been stated, so as to provide references for researchers who are engaged in the synthesis of EMs.",

        "Abstract": "Over the last 25 years, inhibition of Janus kinases (JAKs) has been pursued as a modality for treating various immune and inflammatory disorders. While the clinical development of JAK inhibitors (jakinibs) began with the investigation of their use in allogeneic transplantation, their widest successful application came in autoimmune and allergic diseases. Multiple molecules have now been approved for diseases ranging from rheumatoid and juvenile arthritis to ulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis, graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and other inflammatory pathologies in 80 countries around the world. Moreover, two jakinibs have also shown surprising efficacy in the treatment of hospitalized coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients, indicating additional roles for jakinibs in infectious diseases, cytokine storms and other hyperinflammatory syndromes. Jakinibs, as a class of pharmaceutics, continue to expand in clinical applications and with the development of more selective JAK-targeting and organ-selective delivery. Importantly, jakinib safety and pharmacokinetics have been investigated alongside clinical development, further cementing the potential benefits and limits of jakinib use. This review covers jakinibs that are approved or are under late phase investigation, focusing on clinical applications, pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, and future opportunities and challenges.",

        "Abstract": "The four Janus kinase (JAK) proteins and seven signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) transcription factors mediate intracellular signal transduction downstream of cytokine receptors, which are implicated in the pathology of autoimmune, allergic and inflammatory diseases. Development of targeted small-molecule therapies such as JAK inhibitors, which have varied selective inhibitory profiles, has enabled a paradigm shift in the treatment of diverse disorders. JAK inhibitors suppress intracellular signalling mediated by multiple cytokines involved in the pathological processes of rheumatoid arthritis and many other immune and inflammatory diseases, and therefore have the capacity to target multiple aspects of those diseases. In addition to rheumatoid arthritis, JAK inhibition has potential for treatment of autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus, spondyloarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and alopecia areata, in which stimulation of innate immunity activates adaptive immunity, leading to generation of autoreactive T cells and activation and differentiation of B cells. JAK inhibitors are also effective in the treatment of allergic disorders, such as atopic dermatitis, and can even be used for the COVID-19-related cytokine storm. Mechanism-based treatments targeting JAK-STAT pathways have the potential to provide positive outcomes by minimizing the use of glucocorticoids and/or non-specific immunosuppressants in the treatment of systemic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, Virtual Reality (VR) Head-Mounted Displays (HMD) have been used to provide an immersive, first-person view in real-time for the remote-control of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV). One critical issue is that it is challenging to perceive the distance of obstacles surrounding the vehicle from 2D views in the HMD, which deteriorates the control of UGV. Conventional distance indicators used in HMD take up screen space which leads clutter on the display and can further reduce situation awareness of the physical environment. To address the issue, in this paper we propose off-screen in-device feedback using vibro-tactile and/or light-visual cues to provide real-time distance information for the remote control of UGV. Results from a study show a significantly better performance with either feedback type, reduced workload and improved usability in a driving task that requires continuous perception of the distance between the UGV and its environmental objects or obstacles. Our findings show a solid case for in-device vibro-tactile and/or light-visual feedback to support remote operation of UGVs that highly relies on distance perception of objects.",

Severe acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the major clinical manifestations of COVID-19 with the need for renal replacement therapy.

Therefore, thermal stability is crucial for EMs, especially the thermal dynamic behavior. In the past decade, significant efforts have been made to study the thermal dynamic behavior of 3,4-bis(3-nitrofurazan-4-yl)furoxan (DNTF), one of the new high-energy-density materials (HEDMs). However, the thermal decomposition mechanism of DNTF is still not specific or comprehensive. In this study, the self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding method was combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal the differences in the thermal decomposition of DNTF under four heating conditions. The O-N (O) bond would fracture first during DNTF initial thermal decomposition at medium and low temperatures, thus triggering the cracking of the whole structure. At 2000 and 2500 K, NO",

        "Abstract": "Since its discovery, the Janus kinase-signal transduction and activation of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway has become recognized as a central mediator of widespread and varied human physiological processes. The field of JAK-STAT biology, particularly its clinical relevance, continues to be shaped by 2 important advances. First, the increased use of genomic sequencing has led to the discovery of novel clinical syndromes caused by mutations in JAK and STAT genes. This has provided insights regarding the consequences of aberrant JAK-STAT signaling for immunity, lymphoproliferation, and malignancy. In addition, since the approval of ruxolitinib and tofacitinib, the therapeutic use of JAK inhibitors (jakinibs) has expanded to include a large spectrum of diseases. Efficacy and safety data from over a decade of clinical studies have provided additional mechanistic insights while improving the care of patients with inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. This review discusses major advances in the field, focusing on updates in genetic diseases and in studies of clinical jakinibs in human disease.",

        "Abstract": "The secretory carrier-associated membrane proteins (SCAMPs) are associated with the development of multiple human cancers. The role of SCAMPs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, remains to be identified. In the present study, we explored expression patterns and prognostic value of SCAMPs and network analysis of SCAMPs-related signaling pathways in AML using Oncomine, GEPIA, cBioPortal, LinkedOmics, DAVID and Metascape databases. Genetic alteration analysis revealed that the mutation rate of SCAMP genes was below 1% (9/1272) in AML, and there was no significant correlation between SCAMPs gene mutation and AML prognosis. However, the SCAMP2/5 mRNA levels were significantly higher in AML patients than in healthy controls. Moreover, high mRNA expressions of SCAMP2/4/5 were associated with poor overall survival, which might be due to that SCAMP2/4/5 and their co-expressed genes were associated with multiple pathways related to tumorigenesis and progression, including human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection, acute myeloid leukemia, mTOR and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. These results suggest that SCAMP2/4/5 are potential prognostic markers for AML, and that SCAMP2 and SCAMP5 individually or in combination may be used as diagnostic markers for AML.",

        "Title": "Autophagy-Related Gene Pairs Signature for the Prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.",
        "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been recognized as the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. There is increasing evidence that the abnormal expression of autophagy-related genes plays an important role in the occurrence and development of HCC. Therefore, the study of autophagy-related genes can further elucidate the genetic drivers of cancer and provide valuable therapeutic targets for clinical treatment. In this study, we used 232 autophagy-related genes extracted from the Human Autophagy Database (HADb) and Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to construct 1884 autophagy-related gene pairs. On this basis, we developed a prognostic model based on autophagy-related gene pairs using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression to evaluate the prognosis of patients after liver cancer resection. We then used 845 liver cancer samples from three different databases to test the reliability of the risk signature through survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, univariate and multivariate analysis. To further explore the underlying biological mechanisms, we conducted an enrichment analysis of autophagy-related genes. Finally, we combined the signature with independent prognostic factors to construct a nomogram. Based on the autophagy-related gene pair (ARGP) signature, we can divide patients into high- or low-risk groups. Survival analysis and ROC curve analysis verified the validity of the signature (AUC: 0.786-0.828). Multivariate Cox regression showed that the risk score can be used as an independent predictor of the clinical outcomes of liver cancer patients. Notably, this model has a more accurate predictive effect than most prognostic models for hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, our model is a powerful supplement to the HCC staging indicator, and a nomogram comprising both indicators can provide a better prognostic effect. Based on pairs of multiple autophagy-related genes, we proposed a prognostic model for predicting the overall survival rate of HCC patients after surgery, which is a promising prognostic indicator.

        "Abstract": "1-Methyl-4,5-dinitroimidazole (MDNI)/1-methyl-3,4,5-trinitropyrazole (MTNP) mixtures with different mass ratios were investigated by a combination of theory and experiment. The melting points were predicted using the relationships of specific volume versus temperature, non-bond energy versus temperature, and diffusion coefficient versus temperature, and compared with the experimental values. It was found that the melting point values obtained from the three relationships were in good agreement with the experimentally measured melting points with little error. The interactions between MDNI/MTNP were analyzed by binding energy and RDF, and the results showed that, as the temperature increased, the intermolecular interactions weakened, the binding energy decreased, and the stability of the system decreased. The comprehensive results show that mixture 4 (MDNI/MTNP\u2009=\u200960/40) has a low melting point value and good compatibility, and the detonation velocity and density are improved compared with TNT and MDNI, which is expected to be further applied in melt-cast explosives.",

        "Abstract": "Exosomes are small membranous vesicles released by many kinds of cells, and are indispensable in cell-to-cell communication by delivering functional biological components both locally and systemically. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are long transcripts over 200 nucleotides that exhibit no or limited protein-coding potentials. LncRNAs are dramatic gene expression regulators, and can be selectively sorted into exosomes. Exosomal lncRNAs derived from cancer cells and stromal cells can mediate the generation of pre-metastatic niches (PMNs) and thus promote the progression of cancer. In this review, we summarized the fundamental biology and characteristics of exosomal lncRNAs. Besides, we provided an overview of current research on functions of exosomal lncRNAs between cancer cells and non-cancer cells. A deep understanding of exosomal lncRNAs' role in cancer will be facilitated to find important implications for cancer development and treatment.",

        "Abstract": "T cells are indisputably critical mediators of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), where they secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote vascular pathology. Equally well-established is the fact that autoimmune diseases, which are mediated by autoreactive T cells, substantially increase the risk of developing CVD. Indeed, as immunomodulatory treatments have become more effective at treating end-organ pathology, CVD has become a leading cause of death in patients with autoimmune diseases. Despite this, investigators have only recently begun to probe the mechanisms by which autoreactive T cells promote CVD in the context of autoimmune diseases. T cells are best-studied in the pathogenesis of systemic vasculitides, where they react to self-antigen in the vessel wall. However, newer studies indicate that T cells also contribute to the increased CVD risk associated with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Given the central role of T-cell-derived cytokines in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the role of these factors in psoriatic CVD is also under investigation. In the future, T cells are likely to represent major targets for the prevention and treatment of CVD in patients with autoimmune diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Chenopodium quinoa, a halophytic crop belonging to the Amaranthaceae, has remarkable resistance to harsh growth conditions and produces seed with excellent nutritional value. This makes it a suitable crop for marginal soils. However, to date most of the commercial cultivars are susceptible to preharvest sprouting (PHS). Meanwhile, understanding of the PHS regulatory mechanisms is still limited. Abscisic acid (ABA) has been demonstrated to be tightly associated with seed dormancy and germination regulation in many crops. Whether ABA metabolism pathway could be manipulated to prevent PHS in quinoa is worth investigating. In the present study, we tested the inhibitory effects of exogenous ABA on quinoa seed germination. By RNA-seq analysis we investigated the global gene expression changes during seed germination, and obtained 1066 ABA-repressed and 392 ABA-induced genes. Cis-elements enrichment analysis indicated that the promoters of these genes were highly enriched in motifs \"AAAAAAAA\" and \"ACGTGKC (K\u00a0=\u00a0G/T)\", the specific binding motifs of ABI3/VP1 and ABI5. Transcription factor annotation showed that 13 genes in bHLH, MADS-box, G2-like and NF-YB, and five genes in B3, bZIP, GATA and LBD families were specifically ABA-repressed and -induced, respectively. Furthermore, expression levels of 53 key homologs involved in seed dormancy and germination regulation were markedly changed. Hence, we speculated that the 18 transcription factors and the homologs were potential candidates involved in ABA-mediated seed dormancy and germination regulation, which could be manipulated for molecular breeding of quinoa elites with PHS tolerance in future.",

        "Title": "Influence of Temperature Variation on the Vibrational Characteristics of Fused Silica Cylindrical Resonators for Coriolis Vibratory Gyroscopes.",
        "Abstract": "The fused silica cylindrical resonator is a type of axisymmetric resonator that can be used for Coriolis vibratory gyroscopes. Although the resonant frequency, frequency mismatch, and Q factor are natural properties of the resonator, they can change with temperature. Therefore, the temperature drift severely limits the detection accuracy and bias stability of the gyroscope. In this paper, the influence of temperature variation on the vibrational characteristics of fused silica cylindrical resonators was investigated. Experiments were performed on a fused silica cylindrical resonator coated with Cr/Au films. It was shown that at the temperature range from 253.15 K to 353.15 K, the resonant frequency linearly increased with temperature, the frequency mismatch remained unchanged, and the Q factor gradually increased till about 333.15 K, when it began to decrease. Meanwhile, the change of thermoelastic damping with temperature may dominate the variation of Q factor at the temperature range from 253.15 K to 353.15 K. This phenomenon was theoretically analyzed and the variation trends of results were consistent with the theoretical analysis. This study indicates that, for the fused silica cylindrical resonator, to discover the influence of temperature variation on the resonant frequency, frequency mismatch, and Q factor, there are certain rules to follow and repeat. The relationship between temperature and frequency can be established, which provides the feasibility of using self-calibration based on temperature characteristics of the resonator for temperature drift compensations. Additionally, there is an optimum temperature that may improve the performance of the Coriolis vibratory gyroscope with the fused silica cylindrical resonator.",

        "Abstract": "Many living organisms undergo conspicuous or abrupt changes in body structure, which is often accompanied by a behavioral change. Inspired by the natural metamorphosis, robotic systems can be designed as reconfigurable to be multifunctional. Here, a tissue-engineered transformable robot is developed, which can be remotely controlled to assume different mechanical structures for switching locomotive function. The soft robot is actuated by a muscular tail fin that emulates the swimming of whales and works as a cellular engine powered by the synchronized contraction of striated cardiac microtissue constructs. For a transition of locomotive behavior, the robot can be optically triggered to transform from a spread to a retracted form, which effectively changes the bending stiffness of the tail fins, thus minimizing the propulsion output from the \"tail fin\" and effectively switching off the engine. With the unprecedented controllability and responsiveness, the transformable robot is implemented to work as a cargo carrier for programmed delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to selectively eradicate cancer cells. It is believed that the realization of the transformable concept paves a pathway for potential development of intelligent biohybrid robotic systems.",

        "Abstract": "The pathophysiology of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is heterogeneous, associated with systemic arteriopathies and inflammatory diseases, and often compounded by environmental precipitants, genetics, or stressors. However, the frequency of these associated conditions with SCAD on a population level remains unknown. Therefore, the objective of this analysis was to evaluate heterogeneous phenotypes of SCAD in the United States using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample collected from January 1, 2004, to September 31, 2015. Among 66,360 patients diagnosed with SCAD, the mean age was 63.1 \u00b1 13.2 years and 44.2% were women. A total of 3,415 (5.14%) had depression, 670 (1.0%) had rheumatoid arthritis, 640 (0.96%) had anxiety, 545 (0.82%) had a migraine disorder, 440 (0.66%) used steroids, 385 (0.58%) had malignant hypertension, 280 (0.42%) had systemic lupus erythematosus, 250 (0.38%) had cocaine abuse, 215 (0.32%) had hypertensive heart or renal disease, 130 (0.19%) had coronary spasm, 105 (0.16%) had fibromuscular dysplasia, 85 (0.13%) had Crohn's disease, 75 (0.11%) had celiac disease, 60 (0.09%) had adult autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, 60 (0.09%) had hormone replacement therapy, 55 (0.08%) had sarcoidosis, 55 (0.08%) had amphetamine abuse, 15 (0.02%) had granulomatosis polyangiitis, 10 (0.02%) had \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency, 10 (0.02%) had Marfan syndrome, 10 (0.02%) had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 10 (0.02%) had Kawasaki disease, 10 (0.02%) had polyarteritis nodosa, and 5 (0.01%) had multiparity. In conclusion, most cases of SCAD had no apparent concomitant arteriopathy, inflammatory disorder, or evident risk factor.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in literature for a constellation of MAS, glomerulonephritis, pericarditis, and retinal vasculitis as initial presentation of SLE. Despite extensive multisystem involvement of his disease, the patient responded well to initial steroid treatment, with mycophenolate mofetil successfully added as a steroid-sparing agent. Our case highlights the importance of multispecialty collaboration in the diagnosis and management of SLE with multisystem involvement.",

Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, has shown activity in diffuse large B cell lymphoma, especially in the subtype of ABC DLBCL. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and adverse events in bortezomib-containing regimens with standard R-CHOP regimen in treating DLBCL. Our results show that comparing to standard R-CHOP regimen, bortezomib-containing regimen could not prolong the survival in patients with ABC DLBCL. And patients who received bortezomib had a trend of higher risk with peripheral neuropathy, although there is no significant statistical difference.",

        "Abstract": "Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders. Mounting studies have suggested an involvement of angiogenesis signaling in NHLs progression and resistance to treatment. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of CS2164, a novel receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor selectively targeting VEGFR-2 and Aurora B in NHL cells. By in vitro culture system and in vivo xenograft model, we found that CS2164 significantly inhibited cell growth and abolished clonogenicity in NHL cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, CS2164 significantly induced NHL cells apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Moreover, CS2164 suppressed NHL cells growth and progression in an in vivo xenograft model. Mechanistically, CS2164-induced cytotoxicity was closely associated with inhibition of VEGFR2 and Aurora B as well as their downstream signaling cascades, including P38, ERK and H3 pathways. In conclusion, CS2164 exerts its cytotoxic effect via inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis by modulating VEGFR2 and Aurora B signaling pathway, supporting a potential role for CS2164 in the treatment of NHLs.",

        "Title": "Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with increased in-hospital mortality in asthma exacerbations: a nationwide study.",
        "Abstract": "The relationship between RA and asthma has been yielding conflicting results, with most recent studies showing a possible positive association. The study aims at the outcomes of adult patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbation in those with and without RA. We used data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) for the period of 2012-2014. ICD 9 code was used to identify the diagnosis. Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Our secondary outcome was total asthma exacerbation hospitalizations, length of stay, and total hospital charges. Compared to those without RA, RA was associated with increased hospitalizations for asthma exacerbation (unadjusted OR 1.29, p\u2009<\u20090.001; adjusted OR 1.06, p\u2009=\u20090.002), more respiratory and systemic comorbidities, increased in-hospital mortality (unadjusted OR 1.89, p\u2009=\u20090.001; adjusted OR 1.60, p\u2009=\u20090.020), length of stay (4.5 vs 3.8; unadjusted p\u2009<\u20090.001, adjusted p\u2009<\u20090.001), and total hospital charges (30,149 vs 26,247; unadjusted p\u2009<\u20090.001, adjusted p\u2009=\u20090.048). Our study was the first to demonstrate that RA is associated with increased in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and cost using a national inpatient database. We hypothesize that in asthmatic patients with concurrent RA, their asthma may represent a distinctive subgroup that is more severe and carries a poorer prognosis, which deserves more attention and future investigation.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding how the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) evolved during crucial past geological periods is important in order to decipher the interplay between ocean dynamics and global climate change. Previous research, based on geological proxies, has provided invaluable insights into past AMOC changes. However, the causes of the changes in water mass distributions in the Atlantic during different periods remain mostly elusive. Using a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we show that the bulk of NCW in the deep South Atlantic Ocean below 4000\u2009m migrated from the western basins at 125\u2009ka to the eastern basins at 115\u2009ka, though the AMOC strength is only slightly reduced. These changes are consistent with proxy records, and it is mainly due to more penetration of the AABW at depth at 115\u2009ka, as a result of a larger density of AABW formed at 115\u2009ka. Our results show that depth changes in regional deep water pathways can result in large local changes, while the overall AMOC structure hardly changes. Future research should thus be careful when interpreting single proxy records in terms of large-scale AMOC changes, and considering variability of water-mass distributions on sub-basin scale would give more comprehensive interpretations of sediment records.",

        "Title": "Prognostic role of TET2 deficiency in myelodysplastic syndromes: A meta-analysis.",
        "Abstract": "Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase2 gene (TET2) is one of the most frequently mutated gene in myeloid neoplasm, but the prognostic role of TET2 aberrations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) remains unclear. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis. Fourteen eligible studies with 1983 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Among these, 2 studies evaluated the impact that the TET2 expression level had on the prognosis. The combined hazard ratios (HR) estimated for overall survival (OS) was 1.00 (95%CI: 0.74 to 1.37; p=0.989) when comparing those with TET2 mutations with those without. Among the patients treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the pooled HR for OS was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.77-1.35, p=0.89) and 1.54 (95%CI: 0.69 to 3.44; p=0.29), respectively. We also conducted an analysis of the response rate to HMAs, and the OR was 1.73 (95%CI: 1.11 to 2.70; p=0.016). Additionally, subgroup analyses showed the pooled HR for OS was 0.93(95%CI: 0.44 to 1.98; P=0.849) in WHO-classified CMML patients and 1.02(95%CI: 1.02 to 3.46; p=0.042) in studies evaluated TET2 expression level. The analysis suggested TET2 mutations had no significant prognostic value on MDS. However, the response rates to HMAs were significantly different between those with and without TET2 mutations, and the low expression level of TET2 gene was significantly associated with a poor OS in MDS patients.",

        "Abstract": "Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare systemic vasculitis commonly with cardiac complications. We describe a case of anti-PR3 ANCA-positive EGPA complicated by congestive heart failure and intraventricular thrombosis. Interestingly, the thrombus was resolved rapidly with steroid and cyclophosphamide in the setting of interrupted anticoagulation. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of anti-PR3 positive EGPA with extensive cardiac involvement. Our patient had overlapping features with previously studied ANCA-positive and ANCA-negative EGPA cases. We also hypothesize that the thrombogenic potential of eosinophils may play a central role in thrombogenesis in EGPA and aggressive immunosuppressive therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment, and the addition of anticoagulation therapy in the setting of thrombus formation and also very high risk of bleeding needs to be considered cautiously.",

        "Abstract": "Antibodies targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1) help prevent tumor cells from escaping immune-mediated destruction. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to gain insight into the efficacy of PD-1 antibodies for the treatment of melanoma. Five trials involving 2,828 adult patients were included in this meta-analysis. In patients with previously untreated or refractory melanoma, treatment with PD-1 antibodies significantly improved the six-month progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.50-0.60, P<0.00001) and the overall response rate (OR 3.89, 95% CI 3.12-4.83, P<0.00001). This meta-analysis indicated that anti-PD-1 treatment might provide a significant survival benefit in patients with melanoma. In addition, we found that patients treated with nivolumab reported significantly fewer treatment-related adverse events (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.97, P = 0.03) than those treated with other agents, but there was a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of adverse events in patients treated with pembrolizumab.",

        "Abstract": "The effects of femtosecond laser ablation, with 115 fs pulses at 1040 nm wavelength and 57 MHz repetition-rate, on the physical and chemical properties of polylactide (PLA) were studied in air and in water. The surface of the PLA sample ablated by high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser was analysed using field emission scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, raman spectroscopy, as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Compared with the experiments in the air at ambient temperature, melting resolidification was negligible for the experiments conducted under water. Neither in air nor under water did oxidation and crystallization process take place in the laser ablated surface. In addition, the intensity of some oxygen related peaks increased for water experiments, probably due to the hydrolysis. Meantime, the chemical shift to higher energies appeared in C1s XPS spectrum of laser processing in water. Interestingly, a large amount of defects were observed after laser processing in air, while no significant change was shown under water experiments. This indicates that thermal and mechanical effects by high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser ablation in water are quite limited, which could be even ignored.",

        "Title": "High resource-capture and -use efficiency, and effective antioxidant protection contribute to the invasiveness of Alnus formosana plants.",
        "Abstract": "To investigate the traits contributing to the invasiveness of Alnus formosana and the mechanisms underlying its invasiveness, we compared A. formosana with its native congener (Alnus cremastogyne) under three light treatments (13%, 56%, and 100%). The consistently higher plant height, total leaf area, light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)), light saturation point (LSP), light compensation point (LCP), respiration efficiency (RE), and non-photochemical quenching coefficient (NPQ) but lower root mass fraction (RMF) and specific leaf area (SLA) of the invader than of its native congener contributed to the higher RGR and total biomass of A. formosana across light regimes. The total biomass and RGR of the invader increased markedly with increased RMF, A(max), LSP, LCP, RE, stomatal conductance (G(s)) and total leaf area. Furthermore, compared with the native species, the higher plasticity index in plant height, RMF, leaf mass fraction (LMF), SMF, SLA, A(max) and dark respiration rate (R(d)) within the range of total light contributed to the higher performance of the invader. In addition, the activities of antioxidant enzymes were higher in the invader compared to the native, contributing to its invasion success under high/low light via photoprotection. With a decrease in light level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities increased significantly, whereas total carotenoid (Car) and total chlorophyll (Chl) decreased; ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities remained unchanged. These responses may help the invader to spread and invade a wide range of habitats and form dense monocultures, displacing native plant species. The results suggest that both resource capture-related traits (morphological and photosynthetic) and adaptation-related traits (antioxidant protection) contribute to the competitive advantage of the invader.",

        "Abstract": "Driven by the growing numbers of intensified pig farms around cities in China, there are problems of nutrient surplus and shortage of arable land for utilising the manure. Hence, sustainable livestock systems with effective manure management are needed. The objective of this study is to compare the existing manure treatment of a typical pig farm in Beijing area (separate collection of faeces; 'Gan qing fen' system) with an alternative system and to identify the nutrients flow of the whole farm in order to quantify environmental burdens and to estimate the arable land required for sustainable nutrients recycling. Life cycle assessment is used for this purpose. Acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP) and global warming potential (GWP) are analysed in detail; the functional unit is the annual production of the pig farm. The results show that the cropland area demand for sustainable land application of the effluent can be reduced from 238 to 139 ha with the alternative system. It is possible to transfer 29% of total nitrogen, 87% of phosphorus, 34% of potassium and 75% of magnesium to the compost, and to reduce the total AP, EP and GWP of manure management on the farm by 64.1%, 96.7% and 22%, respectively, compared with the current system. Besides an effective manure management system, a full inventory of the regional nutrients flow is needed for sustainable development of livestock systems around big cities in China.",

        "Abstract": "It is necessary to achieve the optimization for MSW logistics based on the new Xicheng (combining the former Xicheng and the former Xuanwu districts) and the new Dongcheng (combining the former Dongcheng and the former Chongwen districts) districts of Beijing. Based on the analysis of current MSW logistics system, transfer station's processing capacity and the terminal treatment facilities' conditions of the four former districts and other districts, a MSW logistics system was built by GIS methods considering transregional treatment. This article analyzes the MSW material balance of current and new logistics systems. Results show that the optimization scheme could reduce the MSW collection distance of the new Xicheng and the new Dongcheng by 9.3 x 10(5) km x a(-1), reduced by 10% compared with current logistics. Under the new logistics solution, considering transregional treatment, can reduce landfill treatment of untreated MSW about 28.3%. If the construction of three incineration plants finished based on the new logistics, the system's optimal ratio of incineration: biochemical treatment: landfill can reach 3.8 : 4.5 : 1.7 compared with 1 : 4.8 : 4.2, which is the ratio of current MSW logistics. The ratio of the amount of incineration: biochemical treatment: landfill approximately reach 4 : 3 : 3 which is the target for 2015. The research results are benefit in increasing MSW utilization and reduction rate of the new Dongcheng and Xicheng districts and nearby districts.",

        "Abstract": "A laboratory scale experiment of composting in a forced aeration system using pig manure with cornstalks was carried out to investigate the effects of both phosphogypsum and dicyandiamide (DCD, C2H4N4) as additives on gaseous emissions and compost quality. Besides a control, there were three amended treatments with different amounts of additives. The results indicated that the phosphogypsum addition at the rate of 10% of mixture dry weight decreased NH3 and CH4 emissions significantly during composting. The addition of DCD at the rate of 0.2% of mixture dry weight together with 10% of phosphogypsum further reduced the N2O emission by affecting the nitrification process. Reducing the phosphogypsum addition to 5% in the presence of 0.2% DCD moderately increased the NH3 emissions but not N2O emission. The additives increased the ammonium content and electrical conductivity significantly in the final compost. No adverse effect on organic matter degradation or the germination index of the compost was found in the amended treatments. It was recommended that phosphogypsum and DCD could be used in composting for the purpose of reducing NH3, CH4 and N2O emissions. Optimal conditions and dose of DCD additive during composting should be determined with different materials and composting systems in further study.",

Chinese pediatric emergency medicine is just children's internal medicine and does not include general surgery, ear-nose-throat, etc. If children have an emergency condition that require specialized treatments they need to go to different departments. However in Canada, the pediatric emergency physicians will first treat the patients whatever the condition, then, if it is a complicated sub specialty problem, they will consult the specialist or let the patient see the specialist later. In addition, resuscitation is done in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in China, but it is done in the emergency room in Canada.

In the present research, a pot experiment with different organic fertilizer and different fertilizer amount input was conducted to study the possibility of using digital photography analysis technology to monitor the N status of organic fertilized maize at 10 leaves unfold stage. The results showed that the greenness intensity (GI) and redness intensity (RI) from maize canopy image had significant inverse linear correlations with the conventional N diagnosis parameters of SPAD readings, upland biomass and upland N uptake. However the blueness intensity (BI) had no significant correlations with those maize N indexes. The correlation coefficient values (r) were from 0.40 to 0.45 for GI, and from 0.45 to 0.53 for RI. To sum totally, the visible digital image color analysis method can be used for the organic fertilized maize N diagnosis at 10 leaves unfold stage. The redness intensity was a relatively better index than others for the organic fertilized maize N status diagnosis in this experimental condition.",

        "Abstract": "The qualities of leachate and groundwater of six MSW landfills in wet period, water period and dry period in Beijing in 2006 were analyzed. The results demonstrated that: although BOD5 and suspended solids content in the leachate of Beishenshu landfill were within acceptable levels according to China standards, COD, ammonia, fecal coliform, BOD5 and suspended solids content in other landfills were greatly high above the permissible range of GB 16889-1997 standards. Ammonia and fecal coliform were mostly serious among assaying index. Using fuzzy mathematics, comprehensive evaluation was that: the underground water qualities of six MSW landfills are all substandard and 95% of groundwater quality was bad. The primary pollutants in groundwater of six MSW landfills were total hardness, followed by fecal coliform.",

        "Abstract": "Transfer station (TS) is an integral part of present-day municipal solid waste (MSW) management systems. To provide information for the incorporation of waste facilities within the current integrated waste management system, the authors measured the existing environmental quality at five MSW TSs. Discharged wastewater, air, and noise were monitored and assayed at the five TSs in Beijing in 2001-2006 during rainy seasons (RSs) and dry seasons (DSs). Except Ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the analytical results of total suspended particles (TSPs), odor, noise, ammonium nitrogen (NH4(+)-N), chemical oxygen demand (COD(Cr)), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), suspended solid (SS), and fecal coliform concentrations were all degree-varied higher than the criteria limit in China. Using fuzzy mathematics, the environmental quality of MSW TSs in Beijing was classified into five categories, with levels of certainty of belonging to different categories and evaluations. The result indicated that the whole environmental quality of Datun TS, Majialou TS, and Xiaowuji TS, in Beijing, were bad during 2001-2006 in RSs and DSs. Except in 2002, the entire environmental quality of the Wuluju TS during 2001-2006 in RSs was poor. Only in the DSs of 2002 and 2003 was the whole environmental quality of the Wuluju TS good. The whole environmental quality of the Yamenkou TS during 2001-2006 in DSs was bad, which was lower than that of 2001-2006 DSs.",

The ligands and the corresponding metal complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, infrared, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and TG-DTA. Analysis of the IR spectra suggested that the lanthanide metal ion Tb(III) coordinated to the ligands via the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring and the carbonyl oxygen atoms for ligand L1 and the nitrogen atom of the pyrazole ring for ligand L2. The fluorescence properties of the two complexes in solid state were investigated and it was discovered that the Tb(III) ions could be sensitized by both the ligand (L1) and ligand (L2) to some extent. In particular, the complex of ligand (L2) is a better green luminescent material that could be used as a candidate material in organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) since it could be much better sensitized by the ligand (L2), and the fluorescence intensity of Tb(III) complex of L2 are almost as twice strong as L1's.",

We measured the air quality at several municipal solid waste (MSW) sites to provide information for the incorporation of logistics facilities within the current integrated waste management system. We monitored ambient air quality at eight MSW collecting stations, five transfer stations, one composting plant, and five disposal sites in Beijing during April 2006. Composite air samples were collected and analyzed for levels of odor, ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), total suspended particles (TSPs), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The results of our atmospheric monitoring demonstrated that although CO and SO2 were within acceptable emission levels according to ambient standards, levels of H2S, TSP, and NO2 in the ambient air at most MSW logistics facilities far exceeded ambient limits established for China. The primary pollutants in the ambient air at Beijing MSW logistics facilities were H2S, TSPs, NO2, and odor. To improve current environmental conditions at MSW logistics facilities, the Chinese government encourages the separation of biogenic waste from MSW at the source.",
