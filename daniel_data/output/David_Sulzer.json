The first committee meeting was held at the Van Andel Institute in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 2012. This group of PD experts has subsequently met annually to assess and prioritize agents that may slow the progression of this neurodegenerative condition, using a systematic approach based on preclinical, epidemiological and, where possible, clinical data. Over the last 12 years, 171 unique agents have been evaluated by the iLCT committee, and there have been 21 completed clinical studies and 20 ongoing trials associated with the initiative. In this review, we briefly outline the iLCT process as well as the clinical development and outcomes of some of the top prioritized agents. We also discuss a few of the lessons that have been learnt, and we conclude with a perspective on what the next decade may bring, including the introduction of multi-arm, multi-stage clinical trial platforms and the possibility of combination therapies for PD.", "pub_date": "2024"}, {"title": "A Human Brain Map of Mitochondrial Respiratory Capacity and Diversity.", "abstract": "Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) powers brain activity", "pub_date": "2024-Mar-22"}, {"title": "5-HT1B receptors mediate dopaminergic inhibition of vesicular fusion and GABA release from striatonigral synapses.", "abstract": "The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a crucial basal ganglia output nucleus, contains a dense expression of dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs), along with dendrites belonging to dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta. These D1Rs are primarily located on the terminals of striatonigral medium spiny neurons, suggesting their involvement in the regulation of neurotransmitter release from the direct pathway in response to somatodendritic dopamine release. To explore the hypothesis that D1Rs modulate GABA release from striatonigral synapses, we conducted optical recordings of striatonigral activity and postsynaptic patch-clamp recordings from SNr neurons in the presence of dopamine and D1R agonists. We found that dopamine inhibits optogenetically triggered striatonigral GABA release by modulating vesicle fusion and Ca ", "pub_date": "2024-Mar-14"}, {"title": "Molecular Design of SERTlight: A Fluorescent Serotonin Probe for Neuronal Labeling in the Brain.", "abstract": "The serotonergic transmitter system plays fundamental roles in the nervous system in neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, pathological processes, and therapeutic effects of antidepressants and psychedelics, as well as in the gastrointestinal and circulatory systems.

Multiple neuroantigens are targets of autoinflammatory T cells in classical central nervous system autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we explored whether additional autoantigenic targets of T cells in PD. We generated 15-mer peptide pools spanning several PD-related proteins implicated in PD pathology, including GBA, SOD1, PINK1, parkin, OGDH, and LRRK2. Cytokine production (IFN\u03b3, IL-5, IL-10) against these proteins was measured using a fluorospot assay and PBMCs from patients with PD and age-matched healthy controls. This approach identified unique epitopes and their HLA restriction from the mitochondrial-associated protein PINK1, a regulator of mitochondrial stability, as an autoantigen targeted by T cells. The T cell reactivity was predominantly found in male patients with PD, which may contribute to the heterogeneity of PD. Identifying and characterizing PINK1 and other autoinflammatory targets may lead to antigen-specific diagnostics, progression markers, and/or novel therapeutic strategies for PD.", "pub_date": "2024-Feb-12"}, {"title": "Dysregulated acetylcholine-mediated dopamine neurotransmission in the eIF4E Tg mouse model of autism spectrum disorders.", "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) consist of diverse neurodevelopmental conditions where core behavioral symptoms are critical for diagnosis. Altered dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum has been suggested to contribute to the behavioral features of ASD. Here, we examine dopamine neurotransmission in a mouse model of ASD characterized by elevated expression of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a key regulator of cap-dependent translation, using a comprehensive approach that encompasses genetics, behavior, synaptic physiology, and imaging. The results indicate that increased eIF4E expression leads to behavioral inflexibility and impaired striatal dopamine release. The loss of normal dopamine neurotransmission is due to a defective nicotinic receptor signaling that regulates calcium dynamics in dopaminergic axons. These findings reveal an intricate interplay between eIF4E, DA neurotransmission, and behavioral flexibility, provide a mechanistic understanding of ASD symptoms and offer a foundation for targeted therapeutic interventions.", "pub_date": "2024-Jan-30"}, {"title": "Interaction of an \u03b1-synuclein epitope with HLA-DRB1", "abstract": "Enteric symptoms are hallmarks of prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD) that appear decades before the onset of motor symptoms and diagnosis.

The cerebellum receives axonal projections from the locus coeruleus, and norepinephrine release is implicated in states of arousal and stress, but whether aversive learning relies on plastic changes in norepinephrine release in the cerebellum is unknown. Here we report that in mice, norepinephrine is released in the cerebellum following an unpredicted noxious event (a foot-shock) and that this norepinephrine release is potentiated powerfully with fear acquisition as animals learn that a previously neutral stimulus (tone) predicts the aversive event. Importantly, both chemogenetic and optogenetic inhibition of the locus coeruleus-cerebellum pathway block fear memory without impairing motor function. Thus, norepinephrine release in the cerebellum is modulated by experience and underlies aversive learning.", "pub_date": "2023-Aug-10"}, {"title": "Perturbation of serine enantiomers homeostasis in the striatum of MPTP-lesioned monkeys and mice reflects the extent of dopaminergic midbrain degeneration.", "abstract": "Loss of dopaminergic midbrain neurons perturbs l-serine and d-serine homeostasis in the post-mortem caudate putamen (CPu) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, it is unclear whether the severity of dopaminergic nigrostriatal degeneration plays a role in deregulating serine enantiomers' metabolism. Here, through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), we measured the levels of these amino acids in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkeys and MPTP-plus-probenecid (MPTPp)-treated mice to determine whether and how dopaminergic midbrain degeneration affects the levels of serine enantiomers in various basal ganglia subregions. In addition, in the same brain regions, we measured the levels of key neuroactive amino acids modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission, including l-glutamate, glycine, l-aspartate, d-aspartate, and their precursors l-glutamine, l-asparagine. In monkeys, MPTP treatment produced severe denervation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic fibers (\u205375%) and increased the levels of serine enantiomers in the rostral putamen (rPut), but not in the subthalamic nucleus, and the lateral and medial portion of the globus pallidus. Moreover, this neurotoxin significantly reduced the protein expression of the astrocytic serine transporter ASCT1 and the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH in the rPut of monkeys. Conversely, concentrations of d-serine and l-serine, as well as ASCT1 and GAPDH expression were unaffected in the striatum of MPTPp-treated mice, which showed only mild dopaminergic degeneration (\u205330%). These findings unveil a link between the severity of dopaminergic nigrostriatal degeneration and striatal serine enantiomers concentration, ASCT1 and GAPDH expression. We hypothesize that the up-regulation of d-serine and l-serine levels occurs as a secondary response within a homeostatic loop to support the metabolic and neurotransmission demands imposed by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Homeostasis of serine enantiomers is disrupted in the post-mortem caudate putamen and cerebrospinal fluid of living Parkinson's disease patients.", "abstract": "L-serine generated in astrocytes plays a pivotal role in modulating essential neurometabolic processes, while its enantiomer, D-serine, specifically regulates NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signalling. Despite their physiological relevance in modulating cerebral activity, serine enantiomers metabolism in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains elusive. Using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), we measured D- and L-serine levels along with other amino acids known to modulate NMDAR function, such as L-glutamate, L-aspartate, D-aspartate, and glycine, in the post-mortem caudate putamen (CPu) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) of PD patients. Moreover, we examined these amino acids in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of de novo living PD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients versus subjects with other neurological disorders (OND), used as control. We found higher D-serine and L-serine levels in the CPu of PD patients but not in the SFG, a cerebral region that, in contrast to the CPu, is not innervated by nigral dopaminergic terminals. We also highlighted a significant elevation of both serine enantiomers in the CSF samples from PD but not in those of AD and ALS patients, compared with control subjects. By contrast, none or only minor changes were found in the amount of other NMDAR modulating amino acids. Our findings identify D-serine and L-serine level upregulation as a biochemical signature associated with nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in PD.", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Conserved and cell type-specific transcriptional responses to IFN-\u03b3 in the ventral midbrain.", "abstract": "Dysregulated inflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) contributes to neuropathology in infectious, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease. With the exception of microglia, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins are virtually undetectable in the mature, healthy central nervous system (CNS). Neurons have generally been considered incapable of antigen presentation, and although interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) can elicit neuronal MHC class I (MHC-I) expression and antigen presentation in vitro, it has been unclear whether similar responses occur in vivo. Here we directly injected IFN-\u03b3 into the ventral midbrain of mature mice and analyzed gene expression profiles of specific CNS cell types. We found that IFN-\u03b3 upregulated MHC-I and associated mRNAs in ventral midbrain microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic neurons. The core set of IFN-\u03b3-induced genes and their response kinetics were similar in neurons and glia, but with a lower amplitude of expression in neurons. A diverse repertoire of genes was upregulated in glia, particularly microglia, which were the only cells to undergo cellular proliferation and express MHC classII (MHC-II) and associated genes. To determine if neurons respond directly via cell-autonomous IFN-\u03b3 receptor (IFNGR) signaling, we produced mutant mice with a deletion of the IFN-\u03b3-binding domain of IFNGR1 in dopaminergic neurons, which resulted in a complete loss of dopaminergic neuronal responses to IFN-\u03b3. Our results demonstrate that IFN-\u03b3 induces neuronal IFNGR signaling and upregulation of MHC-I and related genes in vivo, although the expression level is low compared to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia.", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Dopamine transporter and synaptic vesicle sorting defects underlie auxilin-associated Parkinson's disease.", "abstract": "Auxilin participates in the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), thereby facilitating synaptic vesicle (SV) regeneration at presynaptic sites. Auxilin (DNAJC6/PARK19) loss-of-function mutations cause early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we utilized auxilin knockout (KO) mice to elucidate the mechanisms through which auxilin deficiency and clathrin-uncoating deficits lead to PD. Auxilin KO mice display cardinal features of PD, including progressive motor deficits, \u03b1-synuclein pathology, nigral dopaminergic loss, and neuroinflammation. Significantly, treatment with L-DOPA ameliorated motor deficits. Unbiased proteomic and neurochemical analyses of auxilin KO brains indicated dopamine dyshomeostasis. We validated these findings by demonstrating slower dopamine reuptake kinetics in\u00a0vivo, an effect associated with dopamine transporter misrouting into axonal membrane deformities in the dorsal striatum. Defective SV protein sorting and elevated synaptic autophagy also contribute to ineffective dopamine sequestration and compartmentalization, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration.

Ventral midbrain dopamine neurons exhibit ongoing tonic firing that produces low extrasynaptic levels of dopamine below the detection of conventional extrasynaptic cyclic voltammetry (\u223c10-20 nanomolar), with superimposed bursts that can saturate the dopamine uptake transporter and produce transient micromolar concentrations. The bursts are known to lead to marked presynaptic plasticity via multiple mechanisms, but analysis methods for these kinetic parameters are limited. To provide a deeper understanding of the mechanics of the modulation of dopamine neurotransmission by physiological, genetic, and pharmacological means, we present three computational models of dopamine release with different levels of spatiotemporal complexity to analyze in vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry recordings from the dorsal striatum of mice. The models accurately fit to cyclic voltammetry data and provide estimates of presynaptic dopamine facilitation/depression kinetics and dopamine transporter reuptake kinetics, and we used the models to analyze the role of synuclein proteins in neurotransmission. The models' results support recent findings linking the presynaptic protein \u03b1-synuclein to the short-term facilitation and long-term depression of dopamine release, as well as reveal a new role for \u03b2-synuclein and/or \u03b3-synuclein in the long-term regulation of dopamine reuptake.", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Dynamic physiological \u03b1-synuclein S129 phosphorylation is driven by neuronal activity.", "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies, the elevation of \u03b1-synuclein phosphorylated at Serine129 (pS129) is a widely cited marker of pathology. However, the physiological role for pS129 has remained undefined. Here we use multiple approaches to show for the first time that pS129 functions as a physiological regulator of neuronal activity. Neuronal activity triggers a sustained increase of pS129 in cultured neurons (200% within 4\u2009h). In accord, brain pS129 is elevated in environmentally enriched mice exhibiting enhanced long-term potentiation. Activity-dependent \u03b1-synuclein phosphorylation is S129-specific, reversible, confers no cytotoxicity, and accumulates at synapsin-containing presynaptic boutons. Mechanistically, our findings are consistent with a model in which neuronal stimulation enhances Plk2 kinase activity via a calcium/calcineurin pathway to counteract PP2A phosphatase activity for efficient phosphorylation of membrane-bound \u03b1-synuclein.
