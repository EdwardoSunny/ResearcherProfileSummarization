We previously reported that a brief train of PP stimuli evokes strong supralinear temporal summation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in CA1 PNs that requires NMDAR activation, with relatively little summation in CA2 PNs in mice of either sex. Here we provide evidence from combined immunogold electron microscopy, cell-type specific genetic deletion and pharmacology that the NMDARs required for supralinear temporal summation of the CA1 PP EPSP are presynaptic, located in the PP terminals. Moreover, we found that the number of NMDARs in PP terminals innervating CA1 PNs is significantly greater than that found in PP terminals innervating CA2 PNs, providing a potential explanation for the difference in temporal summation in these two classes of hippocampal PNs.", "pub_date": "2024-Jun-13"}, {"title": "Modulation of aggression by social novelty recognition memory in the hippocampal CA2 region.", "abstract": "The dorsal CA2 subregion (dCA2) of the hippocampus exerts a critical role in social novelty recognition (SNR) memory and in the promotion of social aggression. Whether the social aggression and SNR memory functions of dCA2 are related or represent independent processes is unknown. Here we investigated the hypotheses that an animal is more likely to attack a novel compared to familiar animal and that dCA2 promotes social aggression through its ability to discriminate between novel and familiar conspecifics. To test these ideas, we conducted a multi-day resident intruder (R-I) test of aggression towards novel and familiar conspecifics. We found that mice were more likely to attack a novel compared to familiarized intruder and that silencing of dCA2 caused a more profound inhibition of aggression towards a novel than familiarized intruder. To explore whether and how dCA2 pyramidal neurons encode aggression, we recorded their activity using microendoscopic calcium imaging throughout the days of the R-I test. We found that a fraction of dCA2 neurons were selectively activated or inhibited during exploration, dominance, and attack behaviors and that these signals were enhanced during interaction with a novel compared to familiarized conspecific. Based on dCA2 population activity, a set of binary linear classifiers accurately decoded whether an animal was engaged in each of these forms of social behavior. Of particular interest, the accuracy of decoding aggression was greater with novel compared to familiarized intruders, with significant cross-day decoding using the same familiar animal on each day but not for a familiar-novel pair. Together, these findings demonstrate that dCA2 integrates information about social novelty with signals of behavioral state to promote aggression towards novel conspecifics.", "pub_date": "2024-May-04"}, {"title": "Vivien Chevaleyre (1973-2024).", "abstract": null, "pub_date": "2024-May-01"}, {"title": "Tuned geometries of hippocampal representations meet the computational demands of social memory.", "abstract": "Social memory consists of two processes: the detection of familiar compared with novel conspecifics and the detailed recollection of past social episodes. We investigated the neural bases for these processes using calcium imaging of dorsal CA2 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, known to be important for social memory, during social/spatial encounters with novel conspecifics and familiar littermates. Whereas novel individuals were represented in a low-dimensional geometry that allows for generalization of social identity across different spatial locations and of location across different identities, littermates were represented in a higher-dimensional geometry that supports high-capacity memory storage. Moreover, familiarity was represented in an abstract format, independent of individual identity. The degree to which familiarity increased the dimensionality of CA2 representations for individual mice predicted their performance in a social novelty recognition memory test. Thus, by tuning the geometry of structured neural activity, CA2 is able to meet the demands of distinct social memory processes.", "pub_date": "2024-Apr-17"}, {"title": "Reduced Cholecystokinin-Expressing Interneuron Input Contributes to Disinhibition of the Hippocampal CA2 Region in a Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.", "abstract": "A significant proportion of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients experience drug-resistant seizures associated with mesial temporal sclerosis, in which there is extensive cell loss in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields, with a relative sparing of dentate gyrus granule cells and CA2 pyramidal neurons (PNs). A role for CA2 in seizure generation was suggested based on findings of a reduction in CA2 synaptic inhibition (Williamson and Spencer, 1994) and the presence of interictal-like spike activity in CA2 in resected hippocampal tissue from TLE patients (Wittner et al., 2009). We recently found that in the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PILO-SE) mouse model of TLE there was an increase in CA2 intrinsic excitability associated with a loss of CA2 synaptic inhibition. Furthermore, chemogenetic silencing of CA2 significantly reduced seizure frequency, consistent with a role of CA2 in promoting seizure generation and/or propagation (Whitebirch et al., 2022). In the present study, we explored the cellular basis of this inhibitory deficit using immunohistochemical and electrophysiological approaches in PILO-SE male and female mice.

Although recent progress has been made in identifying the neural circuits that contribute to different types of positive and negative social interactions, the neural mechanisms that enable the discrimination of individuals based on past aversive experiences remain unknown. Here, we developed a modified social fear conditioning paradigm that induced in both sexes robust behavioral discrimination of a conspecific associated with a footshock (CS+) from a non-reinforced interaction partner (CS-). Strikingly, chemogenetic or optogenetic silencing of hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons, which have been previously implicated in social novelty recognition memory, resulted in generalized avoidance fear behavior towards the equally familiar CS-and CS+. One-photon calcium imaging revealed that the accuracy with which CA2 representations discriminate the CS+ from the CS-animal was enhanced following social fear conditioning and strongly correlated with behavioral discrimination. Moreover the CA2 representations incorporated a generalized or abstract representation of social valence irrespective of conspecific identity and location. Thus, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the same hippocampal CA2 subregion mediates social memories based on conspecific familiarity and social threat, through the incorporation of a representation of social valence into an initial representation of social identity.", "pub_date": "2023-Jul-27"}, {"title": "Social odor discrimination and its enhancement by associative learning in the hippocampal CA2 region.", "abstract": "Although the hippocampus is crucial for social memory, how social sensory information is combined with contextual information to form episodic social memories remains unknown. Here, we investigated the mechanisms for social sensory information processing using two-photon calcium imaging from hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons (PNs)-which are crucial for social memory-in awake head-fixed mice exposed to social and non-social odors. We found that CA2 PNs represent social odors of individual conspecifics and that these representations are refined during associative social odor-reward learning to enhance the discrimination of rewarded compared with unrewarded odors. Moreover, the structure of the CA2 PN population activity enables CA2 to generalize along categories of rewarded versus unrewarded and social versus non-social odor stimuli. Finally, we found that CA2 is important for learning social but not non-social odor-reward associations. These properties of CA2 odor representations provide a likely substrate for the encoding of episodic social memory.", "pub_date": "2023-Jul-19"}, {"title": "Hippocampal area CA2 controls seizure dynamics, interictal EEG abnormalities and social comorbidity in mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy.", "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures, abnormal activity between seizures, and impaired behavior. CA2 pyramidal neurons (PNs) are potentially important because inhibiting them with a chemogenetic approach reduces seizure frequency in a mouse model of TLE. However, whether seizures could be stopped by timing inhibition just as a seizure begins is unclear. Furthermore, whether inhibition would reduce the cortical and motor manifestations of seizures are not clear. Finally, whether interictal EEG abnormalities and TLE comorbidities would be improved are unknown. Therefore, real-time optogenetic silencing of CA2 PNs during seizures, interictal activity and behavior were studied in 2 mouse models of TLE. CA2 silencing significantly reduced seizure duration and time spent in convulsive behavior. Interictal spikes and high frequency oscillations were significantly reduced, and social behavior was improved. Therefore, brief focal silencing of CA2 PNs reduces seizures, their propagation, and convulsive manifestations, improves interictal EEG, and ameliorates social comorbidities.", "pub_date": "2023-Jan-18"}, {"title": "Enhanced excitability of the hippocampal CA2 region and its contribution to seizure activity in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy.", "abstract": "The hippocampal CA2 region, an area important for social memory, has been suspected to play a role in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) because of its resistance to degeneration observed in neighboring CA1 and CA3 regions in both humans and rodent models of TLE.

Here, we addressed the role of CA2 using the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus model of TLE. Ex\u00a0vivo electrophysiological recordings from acute hippocampal slices revealed a set of coordinated changes that enhance CA2 PC intrinsic excitability, reduce CA2 inhibitory input, and increase CA2 excitatory output to its major CA1 synaptic target.

These findings provide the first evidence that CA2 actively contributes to TLE seizure activity and may thus be a promising therapeutic target.", "pub_date": "2022-Oct-05"}, {"title": "Seizures, behavioral deficits, and adverse drug responses in two new genetic mouse models of ", "abstract": "De novo mutations in voltage- and ligand-gated channels have been associated with an increasing number of cases of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, which often fail to respond to classic antiseizure medications.

However, distal dendritic spikes are subject to significant attenuation by dendritic cable properties, and often produce only a weak subthreshold depolarization of the soma. Nonetheless, such spikes have been implicated in memory storage, sensory perception and place field formation. How can such a weak somatic response produce such powerful behavioral effects? Here, we use dual dendritic and somatic recordings in acute hippocampal slices of male mice to reveal that dendritic spike propagation, but not spike initiation, is strongly enhanced when the somatic resting potential is depolarized, likely as a result of increased inactivation of A-type K", "pub_date": "2022-Apr-20"}, {"title": "A direct lateral entorhinal cortex to hippocampal CA2 circuit conveys social information required for social memory.", "abstract": "The hippocampus is essential for different forms of declarative memory, including social memory, the ability to recognize and remember a conspecific. Although recent studies identify the importance of the dorsal CA2 region of the hippocampus in social memory storage, little is known about its sources of social information. Because CA2, like other hippocampal regions, receives its major source of spatial and non-spatial information from the medial and lateral subdivisions of entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC), respectively, we investigated the importance of these inputs for social memory. Whereas MEC inputs to CA2 are dispensable, the direct inputs to CA2 from LEC are both selectively activated during social exploration and required for social memory. This selective behavioral role of LEC is reflected in the stronger excitatory drive it provides to CA2 compared with MEC. Thus, a direct LEC \u2192 CA2 circuit is tuned to convey social information that is critical for social memory.", "pub_date": "2022-May-04"}, {"title": "Frequency-Dependent Synaptic Dynamics Differentially Tune CA1 and CA2 Pyramidal Neuron Responses to Cortical Input.", "abstract": "Entorhinal cortex neurons make monosynaptic connections onto distal apical dendrites of CA1 and CA2 pyramidal neurons through the perforant path (PP) projection. Previous studies show that differences in dendritic properties and synaptic input density enable the PP inputs to produce a much stronger excitation of CA2 compared with CA1 pyramidal neurons. Here, using mice of both sexes, we report that the difference in PP efficacy varies substantially as a function of presynaptic firing rate. Although a single PP stimulus evokes a 5- to 6-fold greater EPSP in CA2 compared with CA1, a brief high-frequency train of PP stimuli evokes a strongly facilitating postsynaptic response in CA1, with relatively little change in CA2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that blockade of NMDARs significantly reduces strong temporal summation in CA1 but has little impact on that in CA2. As a result of the differences in the frequency- and NMDAR-dependent temporal summation, naturalistic patterns of presynaptic activity evoke CA1 and CA2 responses with distinct dynamics, differentially tuning CA1 and CA2 responses to bursts of presynaptic firing versus single presynaptic spikes, respectively.", "pub_date": "2021-Sep-29"}, {"title": "Gating movements and ion permeation in HCN4 pacemaker channels.", "abstract": "The HCN1-4 channel family is responsible for the hyperpolarization-activated cation current I", "pub_date": "2021-Jul-15"}, {"title": "Enkephalin release from VIP interneurons in the hippocampal CA2/3a region mediates heterosynaptic plasticity and social memory.", "abstract": "The hippocampus contains a diverse array of inhibitory interneurons that gate information flow through local cortico-hippocampal circuits to regulate memory storage. Although most studies of interneurons have focused on their role in fast synaptic inhibition mediated by GABA release, different classes of interneurons express unique sets of neuropeptides, many of which have been shown to exert powerful effects on neuronal function and memory when applied pharmacologically. However, relatively little is known about whether and how release of endogenous neuropeptides from inhibitory cells contributes to their behavioral role in regulating memory formation. Here we report that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons participate in social memory storage by enhancing information transfer from hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons to CA2 pyramidal neurons. Notably, this action depends on release of the neuropeptide enkephalin from VIP neurons, causing long-term depression of feedforward inhibition onto CA2 pyramidal cells. Moreover, VIP neuron activity in the CA2 region is increased selectively during exploration of a novel conspecific. Our findings, thus, enhance our appreciation of how GABAergic neurons can regulate synaptic plasticity and mnemonic behavior by demonstrating that such actions can be mediated by release of a specific neuropeptide, rather than through classic fast inhibitory transmission.", "pub_date": "2022"}]}
