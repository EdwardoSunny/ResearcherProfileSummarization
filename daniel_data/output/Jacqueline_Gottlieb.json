Curiosity is inversely associated with confidence, suggesting that it is triggered by states of low confidence (subjective uncertainty). The neural mechanisms of this process, however, have been little investigated. What are the mechanisms through which uncertainty about an event gives rise to curiosity about that event? Inspired by studies of sensory uncertainty, we hypothesized that visual areas provide multivariate representations of uncertainty, which are then read out by higher-order structures to generate signals of confidence and, ultimately, trigger curiosity. During fMRI, participants (17 female, 15 male) performed a new task in which they rated their confidence in identifying distorted images of animals and objects and their curiosity to see the clear image. To link sensory certainty and curiosity, we measured the activity evoked by each image in occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) and devised a new metric of \"OTC Certainty\" indicating the strength of evidence this activity conveys about the animal vs. object categories. We show that, consistent with findings using trivia questions, perceptual curiosity peaked at low confidence. Moreover, OTC Certainty negatively correlated with curiosity, establishing a link between curiosity and a multivariate representation of sensory uncertainty. Finally, univariate (average) activity in two frontal areas - vmPFC and ACC - correlated positively with confidence and negatively with curiosity, and the vmPFC mediated the relationship between OTC Certainty and curiosity. The results suggest that multiple mechanisms link curiosity with representations of confidence and uncertainty.", "pub_date": "2024-Jul-05"}, {"title": "The parieto-occipital cortex is a candidate neural substrate for the human ability to approximate Bayesian inference.", "abstract": "Adaptive decision-making often requires one to infer unobservable states based on incomplete information. Bayesian logic prescribes that individuals should do so by estimating the posterior probability by integrating the prior probability with new information, but the neural basis of this integration is incompletely understood. We record fMRI during a task in which participants infer the posterior probability of a hidden state while we independently modulate the prior probability and likelihood of evidence regarding the state; the task incentivizes participants to make accurate inferences and dissociates expected value from posterior probability. Here we show that activation in a region of left parieto-occipital cortex independently tracks the subjective posterior probability, combining its subcomponents of prior probability and evidence likelihood, and reflecting the individual participants' systematic deviations from objective probabilities. The parieto-occipital cortex is thus a candidate neural substrate for humans' ability to approximate Bayesian inference by integrating prior beliefs with new information.", "pub_date": "2024-Feb-09"}, {"title": "A Distinct Neural Code Supports Prospection of Future Probabilities During Instrumental Information-Seeking.", "abstract": "To make adaptive decisions, we must actively demand information, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms of active information gathering. An open question is how the brain estimates expected information gains (EIG) when comparing the current decision uncertainty with the uncertainty that is expected after gathering information. We examined this question using fMRI in a task in which people placed bids to obtain information in conditions that varied independently by prior decision uncertainty, information diagnosticity, and the penalty for an erroneous choice. Consistent with value of information theory, bids were sensitive to EIG and its components of prior certainty and expected posterior certainty. Expected posterior certainty was decoded above chance from multivoxel activation patterns in the posterior parietal and extrastriate cortices. This representation was independent of instrumental rewards and overlapped with distinct representations of EIG and prior certainty. Thus, posterior parietal and extrastriate cortices are candidates for mediating the prospection of posterior probabilities as a key step to estimate EIG during active information gathering.", "pub_date": "2023-Nov-27"}, {"title": "Beta traveling waves in monkey frontal and parietal areas encode recent reward history.", "abstract": "Brain function depends on neural communication, but the mechanisms of this communication are not well understood. Recent studies suggest that one form of neural communication is through traveling waves (TWs)-patterns of neural oscillations that propagate within and between brain areas. We show that TWs are robust in microarray recordings in frontal and parietal cortex and encode recent reward history. Two adult male monkeys made saccades to obtain probabilistic rewards and were sensitive to the (statistically irrelevant) reward on the previous trial. TWs in frontal and parietal areas were stronger in trials that followed a prior reward versus a lack of reward and, in the frontal lobe, correlated with the monkeys' behavioral sensitivity to the prior reward. The findings suggest that neural communication mediated by TWs within the frontal and parietal lobes contribute to maintaining information about recent reward history and mediating the impact of this history on the monkeys' expectations.", "pub_date": "2023-Sep-05"}, {"title": "Inefficient prioritization of task-relevant attributes during instrumental information demand.", "abstract": "In natural settings, people evaluate complex multi-attribute situations and decide which attribute to request information about. Little is known about how people make this selection and specifically, how they identify individual observations that best predict the value of a multi-attribute situation. Here show that, in a simple task of information demand, participants inefficiently query attributes that have high individual value but are relatively uninformative about a total payoff. This inefficiency is robust in two instrumental conditions in which gathering less informative observations leads to significantly lower rewards. Across individuals, variations in the sensitivity to informativeness is associated with personality metrics, showing\u00a0negative associations with extraversion and thrill seeking and positive associations with stress tolerance and need for cognition. Thus, people select informative queries using sub-optimal strategies that are associated with personality traits and influence consequential choices.", "pub_date": "2023-Jun-01"}, {"title": "A Reinforcement Meta-Learning framework of executive function and information demand.", "abstract": "Gathering information is crucial for maximizing fitness, but requires diverting resources from searching directly for primary rewards to actively exploring the environment. Optimal decision-making thus maximizes information while reducing effort costs, but little is known about the neuro-computational implementation of this tradeoff. We present a Reinforcement Meta-Learning (RML) computational model that solves the trade-off between the value and costs of gathering information. We implement the RML in a biologically plausible architecture that links catecholaminergic neuromodulators, the medial prefrontal cortex and topographically organized visual maps and show that it accounts for neural and behavioral findings on information demand motivated by instrumental incentives and intrinsic utility. Moreover, the utility function used by the RML, encoded by dopamine, is an approximation of variational free energy. Thus, the RML presents a biologically plausible mechanism for coordinating motivational, executive and sensory systems generate visual information gathering policies that minimize free energy.", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Uncertainty modulates visual maps during noninstrumental information demand.", "abstract": "Animals are intrinsically motivated to obtain information independently of instrumental incentives. This motivation depends on two factors: a desire to resolve uncertainty by gathering accurate information and a desire to obtain positively-valenced observations, which predict favorable rather than unfavorable outcomes.

We show that valence and uncertainty independently modulated parietal neuronal\u00a0activity, and uncertainty but not reward-related enhancement consistently correlated with behavioral sensitivity.

We replicated prior results that monkeys reliably learned the implicit order of the learnable set. Surprisingly, the monkeys behaved as though some ordering also existed in the unlearnable set, showing consistent choice preference that transferred to novel untrained pairs in this set, even under a preference-discouraging reward schedule that gave rewards more frequently to the stimulus that was selected less often.

By enabling humans to autonomously decide when and what to learn, curiosity has been argued to be crucial for self-organizing temporally extended learning curricula. However, the mechanisms driving people to set intrinsic goals, when they are free to explore multiple learning activities, are still poorly understood. Computational theories propose different heuristics, including competence measures (e.g., percent correct) and learning progress, that could be used as intrinsic utility functions to efficiently organize exploration. Such intrinsic utilities constitute computationally cheap but smart heuristics to prevent people from laboring in vain on unlearnable activities, while still motivating them to self-challenge on difficult learnable activities. Here, we provide empirical evidence for these ideas by means of a free-choice experimental paradigm and computational modeling. We show that while humans rely on competence information to avoid easy tasks, models that include a learning-progress component provide the best fit to task selection data.

Sensitivity to information gain correlates with the monkeys' efficiency at processing the information in the post-saccadic fixation, but is independent of neuronal reward sensitivity. Reward sensitivity, in turn, is unreliable across task contexts, inconsistent with the view that the cells encode economic utility.

We distinguish between information sampling, in which organisms reduce uncertainty relevant to a familiar task, and information search, in which they investigate in an open-ended fashion to discover new tasks. We review evidence that both sampling and search depend on individual preferences over cognitive states, including attitudes towards uncertainty, learning progress and types of information.

In this paper I review recent studies that address questions of attentional learning, cue validity and information seeking in humans and non-human primates. These studies suggest that learning a sampling policy involves large scale interactions between networks of attention and valuation, which implement these policies based on reward maximization, uncertainty reduction and the intrinsic utility of cognitive states.
