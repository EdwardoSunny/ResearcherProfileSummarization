We investigate how such strategies are learned in a task where perched head-fixed mice learn to reach to an invisible target area from a set start position using a joystick. This can be achieved by learning to move in a specific direction or to a specific endpoint location. As mice learn to reach the target, they refine their variable joystick trajectories into controlled reaches, which depend on the sensorimotor cortex. We show that individual mice learned strategies biased to either direction- or endpoint-based movements. This endpoint/direction bias correlates with spatial directional variability with which the workspace was explored during training. Model-free reinforcement learning agents can generate both strategies with similar correlation between variability during training and learning bias. These results provide evidence that reinforcement of individual exploratory behavior during training biases the reaching strategies that mice learn.", "pub_date": "2024-Apr-23"}, {"title": "Dopamine neuron activity encodes the length of upcoming contralateral movement sequences.", "abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) have been related to movement speed, and loss of these neurons leads to bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, other aspects of movement vigor are also affected in PD; for example, movement sequences are typically shorter. However, the relationship between the activity of DANs and the length of movement sequences is unknown. We imaged activity of SNc DANs in mice trained in a freely moving operant task, which relies on individual forelimb sequences. We uncovered a similar proportion of SNc DANs increasing their activity before either ipsilateral or contralateral sequences. However, the magnitude of this activity was higher for contralateral actions and was related to contralateral but not ipsilateral sequence length. In contrast, the activity of reward-modulated DANs, largely distinct from those modulated by movement, was not lateralized. Finally, unilateral dopamine depletion impaired contralateral, but not ipsilateral, sequence length. These results indicate that movement-initiation DANs encode more than a general motivation signal and invigorate aspects of contralateral movements.", "pub_date": "2024-Mar-11"}, {"title": "Myomatrix arrays for high-definition muscle recording.", "abstract": "Neurons coordinate their activity to produce an astonishing variety of motor behaviors.

Previous work has identified that dynamics of neural population\u00a0activity are similar during different movements, where dynamics refer to how the instantaneous spatial\u00a0pattern of population activity changes in time. Here, we test whether invariant dynamics of neural populations are actually used to issue the commands that direct movement. Using a brain-machine interface (BMI) that transforms rhesus macaques' motor-cortex activity into commands for a neuroprosthetic cursor, we discovered that the same command is issued with different neural-activity patterns in different movements. However, these different patterns were predictable, as we found that the transitions\u00a0between activity patterns are governed by the same dynamics across movements. These invariant dynamics are low dimensional, and critically, they align with the BMI, so that they predict the specific component of neural activity that actually issues the next command. We introduce a model of optimal feedback control (OFC) that shows that invariant dynamics can help transform movement feedback into commands, reducing the input that the neural population needs to control movement. Altogether our results demonstrate that invariant dynamics drive commands to control a variety of movements and show how feedback can be integrated with invariant dynamics to issue generalizable commands.", "pub_date": "2023-Jul-24"}, {"title": "Myomatrix arrays for high-definition muscle recording.", "abstract": "Neurons coordinate their activity to produce an astonishing variety of motor behaviors.

A population of sensory neurons labeled by developmental expression of the G protein-coupled receptor Mrgprb4 detects mechanical stimulation in mice. Here, we study the social relevance of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons and reveal that these neurons are required for sexual receptivity and sufficient to induce dopamine release in the brain. Even in social isolation, optogenetic stimulation of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons through the back skin is sufficient to induce a conditioned place preference and a striking dorsiflexion resembling the lordotic copulatory posture. In the absence of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons, female mice no longer find male mounts rewarding: sexual receptivity is supplanted by aggression and a coincident decline in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens.

Despite several pharmacological advances in the use of L-DOPA, a high proportion of chronically treated patients continues to suffer disabling involuntary movements, namely, L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs). As part of the effort to stop these unwanted side effects, the present study used a rodent model to identify and manipulate the striatal outflow circuitry responsible for LIDs. To do so, optogenetic technology was used to activate separately the striatal direct (D1R- expressing) and indirect (D2R- expressing) pathways in a mouse model of PD. Firstly, D1-cre or A2a-cre animals received unilateral injections of neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to simulate the loss of dopamine observed in PD patients. The effects of independently stimulating each pathway were tested to see if experimental dyskinesias could be induced. Secondly, dopamine depleted A2a-cre animals received systemic L-DOPA to evoke dyskinetic movements. The ability of indirect pathway optogenetic stimulation to suppress pre-established LIDs was then tested. Selective manipulation of direct pathway evoked optodyskinesias both in dopamine depleted and intact animals, but optical inhibition of these neurons failed to suppress LIDs. On the other hand, selective activation of indirect striatal projection neurons produced an immediate and reliable suppression of LIDs. Thus, a functional dissociation has been found here whereby activation of D1R- and D2R-expressing projection neurons evokes and inhibits LIDs respectively, supporting the notion of tight interaction between the two striatal efferent systems in both normal and pathological conditions. This points to the importance of maintaining an equilibrium in the activity of both striatal pathways to produce normal movement. Finally, the ability of selective indirect pathway optogenetic activation to block the expression of LIDs in an animal model of PD sheds light on intrinsic mechanisms responsible for striatal-based dyskinesias and identifies a potential therapeutic target for suppressing LIDs in PD patients.", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Prevalence of visual snow and relation to attentional absorption.", "abstract": "Visual snow is a condition of unclear prevalence characterized by tiny flickering dots throughout the entire visual field. It appears to result from visual cortex hyperactivity and possibly correlates with propensity to be engrossed in sensory and imaginary experiences (absorption). The prevalence and correlates of visual snow, and emotional reactions to it, were explored in the general Portuguese population with three studies with online surveys. In Study 1, 564 participants were shown an animated graphic simulation of visual snow and asked to rate how frequently they have similar percepts on a scale anchored by 0% and 100% of their waking time. They also reported their degree of distress and fascination resulting from visual snow. Absorption was measured with the Modified Tellegen Absorption Scale. 44% of respondents reported they see visual snow at least 10% of the time, and 20% reported seeing it between 80% and 100% of the time. Similar to findings in clinical samples, the frequency of visual snow correlated with tinnitus frequency and entoptic phenomena, but not with ophthalmologic problems. It was confirmed that visual snow is related to absorption. Although distress caused by visual snow was generally absent or minimal in our samples, a substantial minority (28%) reported moderate to high levels of distress. High fascination with visual snow was reported by 9%. In Studies 2 and 3, visual snow was measured by means of verbal descriptions without graphic simulation (\"visual field full of tiny dots of light\" and \"world seen with many dots of light\", respectively). The results were similar to those in Study 1, but seeing visual snow 80%-100% of the time was less frequent (6.5% in Study 2 and 3.6% in Study 3). Visual snow has been insufficiently investigated.

Yet antagonist cocontraction is often required to stabilize joints, like when loads are handled. Previous results suggest that these different muscle activation patterns are mediated by separate flexion- and extension-related motor cortical output populations, while others suggest recruitment of task-specific populations. To distinguish between hypotheses, we developed a paradigm in which mice toggle between forelimb tasks requiring antagonist alternation or cocontraction and measured activity in motor cortical layer 5b. Our results conform to neither hypothesis: consistent flexion- and extension-related activity is not observed across tasks, and no task-specific populations are observed. Instead, activity covariation among motor cortical neurons dramatically changes between tasks, thereby altering the relation between neural and muscle activity. This is also observed specifically for corticospinal neurons. Collectively, our findings indicate that motor cortex drives different muscle activation patterns via task-specific activity covariation.", "pub_date": "2022-Sep-27"}]}
