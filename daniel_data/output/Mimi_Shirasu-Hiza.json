Here, we characterize ASD-related pathologies caused by neuron-specific Cul3 knockdown in Drosophila. We confirmed that neuronal Cul3 knockdown causes short sleep, paralleling sleep disturbances in ASD. Because sleep defects and ASD are linked to metabolic dysregulation, we tested the starvation response of neuronal Cul3 knockdown flies; they starved faster and had lower triacylglyceride levels than controls, suggesting defects in metabolic homeostasis. ASD is also characterized by increased biomarkers of oxidative stress; we found that neuronal Cul3 knockdown increased sensitivity to hyperoxia, an exogenous oxidative stress. Additional hallmarks of ASD are deficits in social interactions and learning. Using a courtship suppression assay that measures social interactions and memory of prior courtship, we found that neuronal Cul3 knockdown reduced courtship and learning compared to controls. Finally, we found that neuronal Cul3 depletion alters the anatomy of the mushroom body, a brain region required for memory and sleep. Taken together, the ASD-related phenotypes of neuronal Cul3 knockdown flies establish these flies\u00a0as a genetic model to study molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying ASD pathology, including metabolic and oxidative stress dysregulation and neurodevelopment.", "pub_date": "2024-Jan-17"}, {"title": "Germ fate determinants protect germ precursor cell division by restricting septin and anillin levels at the division plane.", "abstract": "Animal cell cytokinesis, or the physical division of one cell into two, is thought to be driven by constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring at the division plane.

Here, we investigated the genetic loss of a similar enzyme in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Because the enzyme Ebony modifies and inactivates amine neurotransmitters, its loss is assumed to increase neurotransmitter levels, increasing behaviors such as aggression and courtship and decreasing sleep. Indeed, ebony mutants have been described since 1960 as \"aggressive mutants,\" though this behavior has not been quantified. Using automated machine learning-based analyses, we quantitatively confirmed that ebony mutants exhibited increased aggressive behaviors such as boxing\u00a0but also decreased courtship behaviors and increased sleep. Through tissue-specific knockdown, we found that ebony's role in these behaviors was specific to glia. Unexpectedly, direct measurement of amine neurotransmitters in ebony brains revealed that their levels were not increased but reduced. Thus, increased aggression is the anomalous behavior for this neurotransmitter profile. We further found that ebony mutants exhibited increased aggression only when fighting each other, not when fighting wild-type controls. Moreover, fights between ebony mutants were less likely to end with a clear winner than fights between controls or fights between ebony mutants and controls. In ebony vs. control fights, ebony mutants were more likely to win. Together, these results suggest that ebony mutants exhibit prolonged aggressive behavior only in a specific context, with an equally dominant opponent.", "pub_date": "2023-Jun-27"}, {"title": "Dietary restriction ameliorates TBI-induced phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster.", "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions annually and is associated with long-term health decline. TBI also shares molecular and cellular hallmarks with neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), typically increasing in prevalence with age, and is a major risk factor for developing neurodegeneration later in life. While our understanding of genes and pathways that underlie neurotoxicity in specific NDs has advanced, we still lack a complete understanding of early molecular and physiological changes that drive neurodegeneration, particularly as an individual ages following a TBI. Recently Drosophila has been introduced as a model organism for studying closed-head TBI. In this paper, we deliver a TBI to flies early in adult life, and then measure molecular and physiological phenotypes at short-, mid-, and long-term timepoints following the injury. We aim to identify the timing of changes that contribute to neurodegeneration. Here we confirm prior work demonstrating a TBI-induced decline in lifespan, and present evidence of a progressive decline in locomotor function, robust acute and modest chronic neuroinflammation, and a late-onset increase in protein aggregation. We also present evidence of metabolic dysfunction, in the form of starvation sensitivity and decreased lipids, that persists beyond the immediate injury response, but does not differ long-term. An intervention of dietary restriction (DR) partially ameliorates some TBI-induced phenotypes, including lifespan and locomotor function, though it does not alter the pattern of starvation sensitivity of injured flies. In the future, molecular pathways identified as altered following TBI-particularly in the short-, or mid-term-could present potential therapeutic targets.", "pub_date": "2022-Jun-09"}, {"title": "Functional midbody assembly in the absence of a central spindle.", "abstract": "Contractile ring constriction during cytokinesis is thought to compact central spindle microtubules to form the midbody, an antiparallel microtubule bundle at the intercellular bridge. In Caenorhabditis elegans, central spindle microtubule assembly requires targeting of the CLASP family protein CLS-2 to the kinetochores in metaphase and spindle midzone in anaphase. CLS-2 targeting is mediated by the CENP-F-like HCP-1/2, but their roles in cytokinesis and midbody assembly are not known. We found that although HCP-1 and HCP-2 mostly function cooperatively, HCP-1 plays a more primary role in promoting CLS-2-dependent central spindle microtubule assembly. HCP-1/2 codisrupted embryos did not form central spindles but completed cytokinesis and formed functional midbodies capable of supporting abscission. These central spindle-independent midbodies appeared to form via contractile ring constriction-driven bundling of astral microtubules at the furrow tip. This work suggests that, in the absence of a central spindle, astral microtubules can support midbody assembly and that midbody assembly is more predictive of successful cytokinesis than central spindle assembly.", "pub_date": "2022-Mar-07"}, {"title": "Circadian autophagy drives iTRF-mediated longevity.", "abstract": "Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has recently gained interest as a potential anti-ageing treatment for organisms from\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0to humans", "pub_date": "2021"}, {"title": "Circadian regulation of mitochondrial uncoupling and lifespan.", "abstract": "Because old age is associated with defects in circadian rhythm, loss of circadian regulation is thought to be pathogenic and contribute to mortality. We show instead that loss of specific circadian clock components Period (Per) and Timeless (Tim) in male Drosophila significantly extends lifespan. This lifespan extension is not mediated by canonical diet-restriction longevity pathways but is due to altered cellular respiration via increased mitochondrial uncoupling. Lifespan extension of per mutants depends on mitochondrial uncoupling in the intestine. Moreover, upregulated uncoupling protein UCP4C in intestinal stem cells and enteroblasts is sufficient to extend lifespan and preserve proliferative homeostasis in the gut with age. Consistent with inducing a metabolic state that prevents overproliferation, mitochondrial uncoupling drugs also extend lifespan and inhibit intestinal stem cell overproliferation due to aging or even tumorigenesis. These results demonstrate that circadian-regulated intestinal mitochondrial uncoupling controls longevity in Drosophila and suggest a new potential anti-aging therapeutic target.", "pub_date": "2020-Apr-21"}, {"title": "Dissection of central clock function in ", "abstract": "In ", "pub_date": "2019-Oct-15"}, {"title": "Intestinal Snakeskin Limits Microbial Dysbiosis during Aging and Promotes Longevity.", "abstract": "Intestinal barrier dysfunction is an evolutionarily conserved hallmark of aging, which has been linked to microbial dysbiosis, altered expression of occluding junction proteins, and impending mortality. However, the interplay between intestinal junction proteins, age-onset dysbiosis, and lifespan determination remains unclear. Here, we show that altered expression of Snakeskin (Ssk), a septate junction-specific protein, can modulate intestinal homeostasis, microbial dynamics, immune activity, and lifespan in Drosophila. Loss of Ssk leads to rapid and reversible intestinal barrier dysfunction, altered gut morphology, dysbiosis, and dramatically reduced lifespan. Remarkably, restoration of Ssk expression in flies showing intestinal barrier dysfunction rescues each of these phenotypes previously linked to aging. Intestinal up-regulation of Ssk protects against microbial translocation following oral infection with pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, intestinal up-regulation of Ssk improves intestinal barrier function during aging, limits dysbiosis, and extends lifespan.
