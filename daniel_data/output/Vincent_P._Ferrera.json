We investigated transitive inference (TI), a classic relational task paradigm in which subjects must learn a relation ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]) and generalize it to new combinations of items ([Formula: see text]). Through mathematical analysis, we found that a broad range of biologically relevant learning models (e.g. gradient flow or ridge regression) perform TI successfully and recapitulate signature behavioral patterns long observed in living subjects. First, we found that models with item-wise additive representations automatically encode transitive relations. Second, for more general representations, a single scalar \"conjunctivity factor\" determines model behavior on TI and, further, the principle of norm minimization (a standard statistical inductive bias) enables models with fixed, partly conjunctive representations to generalize transitively. Finally, neural networks in the \"rich regime,\" which enables representation learning and improves generalization on many tasks, unexpectedly show poor generalization and anomalous behavior on TI. We find that such networks implement a form of norm minimization (over hidden weights) that yields a local encoding mechanism lacking transitivity. Our findings show how minimal statistical learning principles give rise to a classical relational inductive bias (transitivity), explain empirically observed behaviors, and establish a formal approach to understanding the neural basis of relational abstraction.", "pub_date": "2024-Jul-09"}, {"title": "Emergent neural dynamics and geometry for generalization in a transitive inference task.", "abstract": "Relational cognition-the ability to infer relationships that generalize to novel combinations of objects-is fundamental to human and animal intelligence. Despite this importance, it remains unclear how relational cognition is implemented in the brain due in part to a lack of hypotheses and predictions at the levels of collective neural activity and behavior. Here we discovered, analyzed, and experimentally tested neural networks (NNs) that perform transitive inference (TI), a classic relational task (if A > B and B > C, then A > C). We found NNs that (i) generalized perfectly, despite lacking overt transitive structure prior to training, (ii) generalized when the task required working memory (WM), a capacity thought to be essential to inference in the brain, (iii) emergently expressed behaviors long observed in living subjects, in addition to a novel order-dependent behavior, and (iv) expressed different task solutions yielding alternative behavioral and neural predictions. Further, in a large-scale experiment, we found that human subjects performing WM-based TI showed behavior inconsistent with a class of NNs that characteristically expressed an intuitive task solution. These findings provide neural insights into a classical relational ability, with wider implications for how the brain realizes relational cognition.", "pub_date": "2024"}, {"title": "A mathematical theory of relational generalization in transitive inference.", "abstract": "Humans and animals routinely infer relations between different items or events and generalize these relations to novel combinations of items.

FUS combined with microbubbles can temporarily open the intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) of animals and humans, and facilitate drug delivery. FUS exposure, either with or without microbubbles, has been demonstrated to alter the behavior of non-human primates (NHP), and previous studies have demonstrated the transient and long-term effects of FUS neuromodulation on functional connectivity using resting state functional MRI.

However, cognitive mechanisms of transitive inferences based on rank order remain unclear, as are relative contributions of reward associations and rule-based inference. To explore these issues, we created a conflict between rule- and reward-based learning during a serial ordering task. Rhesus macaques learned two lists, each containing five stimuli that were trained exclusively with adjacent pairs. Selection of the higher-ranked item resulted in rewards. \"Small reward\" lists yielded two drops of fluid reward, whereas \"large reward\" lists yielded five drops. Following training of adjacent pairs, monkeys were tested on novels pairs. One item was selected from each list, such that a ranking rule could conflict with preferences for large rewards. Differences between the corresponding reward magnitudes had a strong influence on accuracy, but we also observed a symbolic distance effect. That provided evidence of a rule-based influence on decisions. RT comparisons suggested a conflict between rule- and reward-based processes. We conclude that performance reflects the contributions of two strategies and that a model-based strategy is employed in the face of a strong countervailing reward incentive.", "pub_date": "2022-Mar-05"}, {"title": "Transitive inference after minimal training in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta).", "abstract": "Rhesus macaques, when trained for several hundred trials on adjacent items in an ordered list (e.g., A > B, B > C, C > D), are able to make accurate transitive inferences (TI) about previously untrained pairs (e.g., A > C, B > D). How that learning unfolds during training, however, is not well understood. We sought to measure the relationship between the amount of TI training and the resulting response accuracy in 4 rhesus macaques using seven-item lists. The training conditions included the absolute minimal case of presenting each of the six adjacent pairs only once prior to testing. We also tested transfer to nonadjacent pairs with 24 and 114 training trials. Because performance during and after small amounts of training is expected to be near chance levels, we developed a descriptive statistical model to estimate potentially subtle learning effects in the presence of much larger random response variability and systematic bias. These results suggest that subjects learned serial order in an incremental fashion. Thus, rather than performing transitive inference by a logical process, serial learning in rhesus macaques proceeds in a manner more akin to a statistical inference, with an initial uncertainty about list position that gradually becomes more accurate as evidence accumulates.

In this context, transitive inference (TI) can be understood as a specific heuristic that applies broadly to many different serial learning tasks, which have been the focus of hundreds of studies involving dozens of species. In the present study, monkeys learned the order of 7-item lists of photographic stimuli by trial and error, and were then tested on \"derived\" lists. These derived test lists combined stimuli from multiple training lists in ambiguous ways, sometimes changing their order relative to training. We found that subjects displayed strong preferences when presented with novel test pairs, even when those pairs were drawn from different training lists. These preferences were helpful when test pairs had an ordering congruent with their ranks during training, but yielded consistently below-chance performance when pairs had an incongruent order relative to training. This behavior can be explained by the joint contributions of transitive inference and another heuristic that we refer to as \"positional inference.\" Positional inferences play a complementary role to transitive inferences in facilitating choices between novel pairs of stimuli. The theoretical framework that best explains both transitive and positional inferences is a spatial model that represents both the position of each stimulus and its uncertainty. A computational implementation of this framework yields accurate predictions about both correct responses and errors on derived lists.", "pub_date": "2022"}, {"title": "Safety evaluation of a clinical focused ultrasound system for neuronavigation guided blood-brain barrier opening in non-human primates.", "abstract": "An emerging approach with potential in improving the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors is the use of focused ultrasound (FUS) to bypass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a non-invasive and localized manner. A large body of pre-clinical work has paved the way for the gradual clinical implementation of FUS-induced BBB opening. Even though the safety profile of FUS treatments in rodents has been extensively studied, the histological and behavioral effects of clinically relevant BBB opening in large animals are relatively understudied. Here, we examine the histological and behavioral safety profile following localized BBB opening in non-human primates (NHPs), using a neuronavigation-guided clinical system prototype. We show that FUS treatment triggers a short-lived immune response within the targeted region without exacerbating the touch accuracy or reaction time in visual-motor cognitive tasks. Our experiments were designed using a multiple-case-study approach, in order to maximize the acquired data and support translation of the FUS system into human studies. Four NHPs underwent a single session of FUS-mediated BBB opening in the prefrontal cortex. Two NHPs were treated bilaterally at different pressures, sacrificed on day 2 and 18 post-FUS, respectively, and their brains were histologically processed. In separate experiments, two NHPs that were earlier trained in a behavioral task were exposed to FUS unilaterally, and their performance was tracked for at least 3\u00a0weeks after BBB opening. An increased microglia density around blood vessels was detected on day 2, but was resolved by day 18. We also detected signs of enhanced immature neuron presence within areas that underwent BBB opening, compared to regions with an intact BBB, confirming previous rodent studies. Logistic regression analysis showed that the NHP cognitive performance did not deteriorate following BBB opening. These preliminary results demonstrate that neuronavigation-guided FUS with a single-element transducer is a non-invasive method capable of reversibly opening the BBB, without substantial histological or behavioral impact in an animal model closely resembling humans. Future work should confirm the observations of this multiple-case-study work across animals, species and tasks.", "pub_date": "2021-Jul-22"}, {"title": "Negative allosteric modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 attenuates alcohol self-administration in baboons.", "abstract": "Many of the behavioral symptoms that define alcohol use disorder (AUD) are thought to be mediated by amplified glutamatergic activity. As a result, previous preclinical studies have investigated glutamate receptor inhibition as a potential pharmacotherapy for AUD, particularly the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5). In rodents, mGlu5 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) have been shown to decrease alcohol self-administration. However, their effect on non-human primates has not previously been explored. To bridge this gap, the effects of mGlu5 NAM pretreatment on sweetened alcohol (8% w/v in diluted KoolAid) self-administration in female baboons were evaluated. Two different mGlu5 NAMs were tested: 1) 3-2((-Methyl-4-thiazolyl) ethynyl) pyridine (MTEP) which was administered at a dose of 2\u00a0mg/kg IM; and 2) auglurant (N-(5-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-6-methyl-4-(pyrimidin-5-yloxy)picolinamide), a newly developed NAM, which was tested under two different routes (0.001, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1\u00a0mg/kg IM and 0.1, 0.3, 1.0\u00a0mg/kg PO). MTEP decreased both fixed ratio and progressive ratio responding for sweetened alcohol. Auglurant, administered IM, decreased alcohol self-administration at doses that did not affect self-administration of an alcohol-free sweet liquid reward (0.01 to 0.1\u00a0mg/kg). Oral administration of auglurant was not effective in decreasing alcohol self-administration. Our results extend positive findings from rodent studies on mGlu5 regulation of alcohol drinking to female baboons and further strengthen the rationale for targeting mGlu5 in clinical trials for AUD.", "pub_date": "2021"}, {"title": "Combining brain perturbation and neuroimaging in non-human primates.", "abstract": "Brain perturbation studies allow detailed causal inferences of behavioral and neural processes. Because the combination of brain perturbation methods and neural measurement techniques is inherently challenging, research in humans has predominantly focused on non-invasive, indirect brain perturbations, or neurological lesion studies. Non-human primates have been indispensable as a neurobiological system that is highly similar to humans while simultaneously being more experimentally tractable, allowing visualization of the functional and structural impact of systematic brain perturbation. This review considers the state of the art in non-human primate brain perturbation with a focus on approaches that can be combined with neuroimaging.

Such learning is difficult to explain by associative mechanisms, but can be accounted for by cognitive representations and processes such as transitive inference. Our study sought to determine if those processes also apply to learning categories of images. We asked whether participants can (a) infer that stimulus images belonged to familiar categories, even when the images for each trial were unique, and (b) sort those categories into an ordering that obeys transitivity. Participants received minimal verbal instruction and a single session of training. Despite this, they learned the implied order of lists of fixed stimuli and lists of ordered categories, using trial-unique exemplars. We trained two groups, one for which stimuli were constant throughout training and testing (n = 60), and one for which exemplars of each category were trial-unique (n = 50).

We recorded the activity of posterior parietal cortex (including lateral intraparietal area LIP) neurons while monkeys learned 7-item transitive inference (TI) lists with 2 items presented on each trial. Behavior and neuronal activity were significantly influenced by the ordinal relationship of the stimulus pairs, specifically symbolic distance (the difference in rank) and joint rank (the sum of the ranks). Symbolic distance strongly predicted decision accuracy and learning rate. An effect of joint rank on performance was found nested within the symbolic distance effect. Across the population of neurons, there was significant modulation of firing correlated with the relative ranks of the two stimuli presented on each trial. Neurons exhibited selectivity for stimulus rank during learning, but not before or after. The observed behavior is poorly explained by associative or reward mechanisms, and appears more consistent with a mental workspace model in which implied serial order is mapped within a spatial framework. The neural data suggest that posterior parietal cortex supports serial learning by representing information about the ordinal relationship of the stimuli presented during a given trial.", "pub_date": "2020-Jun-10"}, {"title": "Reward associations do not explain transitive inference performance in monkeys.", "abstract": "Most accounts of behavior in nonhuman animals assume that they make choices to maximize expected reward value. However, model-free reinforcement learning based on reward associations cannot account for choice behavior in transitive inference paradigms. We manipulated the amount of reward associated with each item of an ordered list, so that maximizing expected reward value was always in conflict with decision rules based on the implicit list order. Under such a schedule, model-free reinforcement algorithms cannot achieve high levels of accuracy, even after extensive training. Monkeys nevertheless learned to make correct rule-based choices. These results show that monkeys' performance in transitive inference paradigms is not driven solely by expected reward and that appropriate inferences are made despite discordant reward incentives.

In 2 experiments, we trained human participants to learn various lists of photographic images. We then tested the participants on new lists of photographic images. These new lists were constructed by selecting only 1 image from each list learned during training. In Experiment 1, participants were trained to choose the earlier (experimenter defined) item when presented with adjacent pairs of items on each of 5 different 5-item lists. Participants were then tested on derived lists, in which each item retained its original ordinal position, even though each of the presented pairs was novel. Participants performed above chance on all of the derived lists. In Experiment 2, a different group of participants received the same training as those of Experiment 1, but the ordinal positions of items were systematically changed on each derived list. The response accuracy for Experiment 2 varied inversely with the degree to which an item's original ordinal position was changed. These results can be explained by a model in which participants learned to make both positional inferences about the absolute rank of each stimulus, and transitive inferences about the relative ranks of pairs of stimuli. These inferences enhanced response accuracy when ordinal position was maintained, but not when it was changed. Our results demonstrate quantitatively that, in addition to item-item associations that participants acquire while learning a list of arbitrary items, they form a cognitive map that represents both experienced and inferred relationships.
