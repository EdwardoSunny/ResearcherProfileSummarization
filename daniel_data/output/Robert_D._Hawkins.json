How do learners aid teachers by providing them with information about their background knowledge and what they find confusing? We formalize this collaborative reasoning process using a hierarchical Bayesian model of pedagogy. We then evaluate this model in two online behavioral experiments (N = 312 adults). In Experiment 1, we show that teachers select examples that account for learners' background knowledge, and adjust their examples based on learners' feedback. In Experiment 2, we show that learners strategically provide more feedback when teachers' examples deviate from their background knowledge.

Recently, artificial neural networks based on the Transformer architecture have revolutionized the field of natural language processing. Transformers integrate contextual information across words via structured circuit computations. Prior work has focused on the internal representations (\"embeddings\") generated by these circuits. In this paper, we instead analyze the circuit computations directly: we deconstruct these computations into the functionally-specialized \"transformations\" that integrate contextual information across words. Using functional MRI data acquired while participants listened to naturalistic stories, we first verify that the transformations account for considerable variance in brain activity across the cortical language network. We then demonstrate that the emergent computations performed by individual, functionally-specialized \"attention heads\" differentially predict brain activity in specific cortical regions. These heads fall along gradients corresponding to different layers and context lengths in a low-dimensional cortical space.", "pub_date": "2024-Jun-29"}, {"title": "Single-neuron analysis of aging-associated changes in learning reveals impairments in transcriptional plasticity.", "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying age-related declines in learning and long-term memory are still not fully understood. To address this gap, our study focused on investigating the transcriptional landscape of a singularly identified motor neuron L7 in Aplysia, which is pivotal in a specific type of nonassociative learning known as sensitization of the siphon-withdraw reflex. Employing total RNAseq analysis on a single isolated L7 motor neuron after short-term or long-term sensitization (LTS) training of Aplysia at 8, 10, and 12\u2009months (representing mature, late mature, and senescent stages), we uncovered aberrant changes in transcriptional plasticity during the aging process. Our findings specifically highlight changes in the expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that encode transcription factors, translation regulators, RNA methylation participants, and contributors to cytoskeletal rearrangements during learning and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Furthermore, our comparative gene expression analysis identified distinct transcriptional alterations in two other neurons, namely the motor neuron L11 and the giant cholinergic neuron R2, whose roles in LTS are not yet fully elucidated. Taken together, our analyses underscore cell type-specific impairments in the expression of key components related to learning and memory within the transcriptome as organisms age, shedding light on the complex molecular mechanisms driving cognitive decline during aging.", "pub_date": "2024-Jun-24"}, {"title": "Flexible social inference facilitates targeted social learning when rewards are not observable.", "abstract": "Groups coordinate more effectively when individuals are able to learn from others' successes. But acquiring such knowledge is not always easy, especially in real-world environments where success is hidden from public view. We suggest that social inference capacities may help bridge this gap, allowing individuals to update their beliefs about others' underlying knowledge and success from observable trajectories of behaviour. We compared our social inference model against simpler heuristics in three studies of human behaviour in a collective-sensing task. Experiment 1 demonstrated that average performance improved as a function of group size at a rate greater than predicted by heuristic models. Experiment 2 introduced artificial agents to evaluate how individuals selectively rely on social information. Experiment 3 generalized these findings to a more complex reward landscape. Taken together, our findings provide insight into the relationship between individual social cognition and the flexibility of collective behaviour.", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Reconciling truthfulness and relevance as epistemic and decision-theoretic utility.", "abstract": "People use language to influence others' ", "pub_date": "2024"}, {"title": "Distribution, cellular localization, and colocalization of several peptide neurotransmitters in the central nervous system of ", "abstract": "Neuropeptides are widely used as neurotransmitters in vertebrates and invertebrates.

Do viewers understand drawings based on how strongly they resemble an entity (i.e., as images) or based on socially mediated conventions (i.e., as symbols)? Here we evaluate a cognitive account of pictorial meaning in which visual and social information jointly support visual communication. Pairs of participants used drawings to repeatedly communicate the identity of a target object among multiple distractor objects. We manipulated social cues across three experiments and a full replication, finding that participants developed object-specific and interaction-specific strategies for communicating more efficiently over time, beyond what task practice or a resemblance-based account alone could explain. Leveraging model-based image analyses and crowdsourced annotations, we further determined that drawings did not drift toward \"arbitrariness,\" as predicted by a pure convention-based account, but preserved visually diagnostic features.

Group coordination often brings to mind synchrony and alignment, where all individuals do the same thing (e.g., driving on the right side of the road, marching in lockstep, or playing musical instruments on a regular beat). Yet, effective coordination also typically involves differentiation, where specialized roles emerge for different members (e.g., prep stations in a kitchen or positions on an athletic team). Role specialization poses a challenge for computational models of group coordination, which have largely focused on achieving synchrony. Here, we present the CARMI framework, which characterizes role specialization processes in terms of five core features that we hope will help guide future model development: Communication, Adaptation to feedback, Repulsion, Multi-level planning, and Intention modeling. Although there are many paths to role formation, we suggest that roles emerge when each agent in a group dynamically allocates their behavior toward a shared goal to complement what they expect others to do. In other words, coordination concerns beliefs (who will do what) rather than simple actions. We describe three related experimental paradigms-\"Group Binary Search,\" \"Battles of the Exes,\" and \"Find the Unicorn\"-that we have used to study differentiation processes in the lab, each emphasizing different aspects of the CARMI framework.", "pub_date": "2024"}, {"title": "Show or tell? Exploring when (and why) teaching with language outperforms demonstration.", "abstract": "People use a wide range of communicative acts across different modalities, from concrete demonstrations to abstract language. While these modalities are typically studied independently, we take a comparative approach and ask when and why one modality might outperform another. We present a series of real-time, multi-player experiments asking participants to teach concepts using either demonstrations or language. Our first experiment (N=416) asks when language might outperform demonstration. We manipulate the complexity of the concept being taught and find that language communicates complex concepts more effectively than demonstration. We then ask why language succeeds in this setting. We hypothesized that language allowed teachers to reference abstract object features (e.g., shapes and colors), while demonstration teachers could only provide concrete examples (specific positive or negative objects). To test this hypothesis, our second experiment (N=568) ablated object features from the teacher's interface. This manipulation severely impaired linguistic (but not demonstrative) teaching. Our findings suggest that language communicates complex concepts by directly transmitting abstract rules. In contrast, demonstrations transmit examples, requiring the learner to infer the rules.", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "A Pragmatic Account of the Weak Evidence Effect.", "abstract": "Language is not only used to transmit neutral information; we often seek to ", "pub_date": "2022"}, {"title": "Semantic relatedness retroactively boosts memory and promotes memory interdependence across episodes.", "abstract": "Two fundamental issues in memory research concern when later experiences strengthen or weaken initial memories and when the two memories become linked or remain independent. A promising candidate for explaining these issues is semantic relatedness. Here, across five paired-associate learning experiments (N=1000), we systematically varied the semantic relatedness between initial and later cues, initial and later targets, or both. We found that learning retroactively benefited long-term memory performance for semantically related words (vs. unshown control words), and these benefits increased as a function of relatedness. Critically, memory dependence between initial and later pairs also increased with relatedness, suggesting that pre-existing semantic relationships promote interdependence for memories formed across episodes. We also found that modest retroactive benefits, but not interdependencies, emerged when subjects learned via studying rather than practice testing. These findings demonstrate that semantic relatedness during new learning retroactively strengthens old associations while scaffolding new ones into well-fortified memory traces.", "pub_date": "2022-Jun-15"}, {"title": "Shades of confusion: Lexical uncertainty modulates ad hoc coordination in an interactive communication task.", "abstract": "There is substantial variability in the expectations that communication partners bring into interactions, creating the potential for misunderstandings. To directly probe these gaps and our ability to overcome them, we propose a communication task based on color-concept associations. In Experiment 1, we establish several key properties of the mental representations of these expectations, or lexical priors, based on recent probabilistic theories. Associations are more variable for abstract concepts, variability is represented as uncertainty within each individual, and uncertainty enables accurate predictions about whether others are likely to share the same association. In Experiment 2, we then examine the downstream consequences of these representations for communication. Accuracy is initially low when communicating about concepts with more variable associations, but rapidly increases as participants form ad hoc conventions. Together, our findings suggest that people cope with variability by maintaining well-calibrated uncertainty about their partner and appropriately adaptable representations of their own.", "pub_date": "2022"}, {"title": "From partners to populations: A hierarchical Bayesian account of coordination and convention.", "abstract": "Languages are powerful solutions to coordination problems: They provide stable, shared expectations about how the words we say correspond to the beliefs and intentions in our heads.
