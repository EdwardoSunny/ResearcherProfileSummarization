Two salient limitations are that <2% of the ~600 E3 ligases in the human genome have been exploited to produce proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), and the efficacy of the approach has not been demonstrated for a vital class of complex multi-subunit membrane proteins- ion channels. NEDD4-1 and NEDD4-2 are physiological regulators of myriad ion channels, and belong to the 28-member HECT (homologous to E6AP C-terminus) family of E3 ligases with widespread roles in cell/developmental biology and diverse diseases including various cancers, immunological and neurological disorders, and chronic pain. The potential efficacy of HECT E3 ligases for targeted protein degradation is unexplored, constrained by a lack of appropriate binders, and uncertain due to their complex regulation by layered intra-molecular and posttranslational mechanisms. Here, we identified a nanobody that binds with high affinity and specificity to a unique site on the N-lobe of the NEDD4-2 HECT domain at a location physically separate from sites critical for catalysis- the E2 binding site, the catalytic cysteine, and the ubiquitin exosite- as revealed by a 3.1 \u00c5 cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction.

This cardiac response depends on \u03b2-adrenergic-initiated reversal of the small RGK G protein Rad-mediated inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV) acting through the Cav\u03b2 subunit. Here, we investigate how Rad couples phosphorylation to augmented Ca2+ influx and increased cardiac contraction. We show that reversal required phosphorylation of Ser272 and Ser300 within Rad's polybasic, hydrophobic C-terminal domain (CTD). Phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 in Rad's N-terminal domain (NTD) alone was ineffective. Phosphorylation of Ser272 and Ser300 or the addition of 4 Asp residues to the CTD reduced Rad's association with the negatively charged, cytoplasmic plasmalemmal surface and with CaV\u03b2, even in the absence of CaV\u03b1, measured here by FRET. Addition of a posttranslationally prenylated CAAX motif to Rad's C-terminus, which constitutively tethers Rad to the membrane, prevented the physiological and biochemical effects of both phosphorylation and Asp substitution. Thus, dissociation of Rad from the sarcolemma, and consequently from CaV\u03b2, is sufficient for sympathetic upregulation of Ca2+ currents.", "pub_date": "2024-Jan-16"}, {"title": "Transfer RNA-mediated restoration of potassium current and electrical correction in premature termination long-QT syndrome hERG mutants.", "abstract": "Disease-causing premature termination codons (PTCs) individually disrupt the functional expression of hundreds of genes and represent a pernicious clinical challenge. In the heart, loss-of-function mutations in the hERG potassium channel account for approximately 30% of long-QT syndrome arrhythmia, a lethal cardiac disorder with limited treatment options. Premature termination of ribosomal translation produces a truncated and, for potassium channels, a potentially dominant-negative protein that impairs the functional assembly of the wild-type homotetrameric hERG channel complex. We used high-throughput flow cytometry and patch-clamp electrophysiology to assess the trafficking and voltage-dependent activity of hERG channels carrying patient PTC variants that have been corrected by anticodon engineered tRNA. Adenoviral-mediated expression of mutant hERG channels in cultured adult guinea pig cardiomyocytes prolonged action potential durations, and this deleterious effect was corrected upon adenoviral delivery of a human Arg", "pub_date": "2023-Dec-12"}, {"title": "A Genetically Encoded Actuator Selectively Boosts L-type Calcium Channels in Diverse Physiological Settings.", "abstract": "L-type Ca ", "pub_date": "2023-Sep-23"}, {"title": "Divergent regulation of KCNQ1/E1 by targeted recruitment of protein kinase A to distinct sites on the channel complex.", "abstract": "The slow delayed rectifier potassium current, ", "pub_date": "2023-Aug-31"}, {"title": "Design and Applications of Genetically-Encoded Voltage-Dependent Calcium Channel Inhibitors.", "abstract": "Ca", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Perturbation of the host cell Ca", "abstract": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

As of February 2023, almost 670 million cases and 6,8 million deaths have been confirmed worldwide. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, contain a single-stranded RNA genome enclosed in a viral capsid consisting of four structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, in the ribonucleoprotein core, the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, and the membrane (M) protein, embedded in the surface envelope. In particular, the E protein is a poorly characterized viroporin with high identity amongst all the \u03b2-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43) and a low mutation rate.

In the present study, we uncover the primary mechanism underlying the heart's innate contractile reserve. We show that four protein kinase A (PKA)-phosphorylated residues in Rad, a calcium channel inhibitor, are crucial for controlling basal calcium current and essential for \u03b2-adrenergic augmentation of calcium influx in cardiomyocytes. Even with intact PKA signaling to other proteins modulating calcium handling, preventing adrenergic activation of calcium channels in Rad-phosphosite-mutant mice (4SA-Rad) has profound physiological effects: reduced heart rate with increased pauses, reduced basal contractility, near-complete attenuation of \u03b2-adrenergic contractile response and diminished exercise capacity. Conversely, expression of mutant calcium-channel \u03b2-subunits that cannot bind 4SA-Rad is sufficient to enhance basal calcium influx and contractility to adrenergically augmented levels of wild-type mice, rescuing the failing heart phenotype of 4SA-Rad mice. Hence, disruption of interactions between Rad and calcium channels constitutes the foundation toward next-generation therapeutics specifically enhancing cardiac contractility.", "pub_date": "2022"}, {"title": "Reduced calcium levels and accumulation of abnormal insulin granules in stem cell models of HNF1A deficiency.", "abstract": "Mutations in HNF1A cause Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (HNF1A-MODY). To understand mechanisms of \u03b2-cell dysfunction, we generated stem cell-derived pancreatic endocrine cells with hypomorphic mutations in HNF1A.

In HNF1A deficient \u03b2-cells, glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea drug used in the treatment of HNF1A-MODY patients, increases intracellular calcium, and restores insulin secretion. While insulin secretion defects are constitutive in \u03b2-cells null for HNF1A, \u03b2-cells heterozygous for hypomorphic HNF1A (R200Q) mutations lose the ability to secrete insulin gradually; this phenotype is prevented by correction of the mutation.

Genetically encoded molecules capable of interrupting nociception have the potential to confer long-lasting analgesia with minimal off-target effects. Here, we utilize a targeted ubiquitination approach to achieve a unique posttranslational functional knockdown of high-voltage-activated calcium channels (HVACCs) that are obligatory for neurotransmission in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. CaV-a\u03b2lator comprises a nanobody targeted to CaV channel cytosolic auxiliary \u03b2 subunits fused to the catalytic HECT domain of the Nedd4-2 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Subcutaneous injection of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 encoding CaV-a\u03b2lator in the hind paw of mice resulted in the expression of the protein in a subset of DRG neurons that displayed a concomitant ablation of CaV currents and also led to an increase in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Mice subjected to spare nerve injury displayed a characteristic long-lasting mechanical, thermal, and cold hyperalgesia underlain by a dramatic increase in coordinated phasic firing of DRG neurons as reported by in vivo Ca2+ spike recordings. CaV-a\u03b2lator significantly dampened the integrated Ca2+ spike activity and the hyperalgesia in response to nerve injury. The results advance the principle of targeting HVACCs as a gene therapy for neuropathic pain and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of posttranslational functional knockdown of ion channels achieved by exploiting the ubiquitin-proteasome system.", "pub_date": "2022-May-17"}, {"title": "Controlling ion channel function with renewable recombinant antibodies.", "abstract": "Selective ion channel modulators play a critical role in physiology in defining the contribution of specific ion channels to physiological function and as proof of concept for novel therapeutic strategies.
