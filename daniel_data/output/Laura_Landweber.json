Programmed genome rearrangements in ciliates offer an extreme example, making them a compelling model system to study DNA rearrangements. Currently, available methods for genome annotation are not adequate for highly scrambled genomes. We present a theoretical framework and software implementation for the systematic extraction and analysis of DNA rearrangement annotations from pairs of genome assemblies corresponding to precursor and product versions. The software makes no assumptions about the structure of the rearrangements, and permits the user to select parameters to suit the data. Compared to previous approaches, this work achieves more complete precursor-product mappings, allows for full transparency and reproducibility, and can be adapted to genomic data from different sources.", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Exploration of the Nuclear Proteomes in the Ciliate ", "abstract": "Nuclear dimorphism is a fundamental feature of ciliated protozoa, which have separate somatic and germline genomes in two distinct organelles within a single cell.

Ciliates, a group of microbial eukaryotes, exhibit germline-somatic nuclear dimorphism within a single cell with two different genomes. The ciliate Oxytricha trifallax undergoes massive RNA-guided DNA elimination and genome rearrangement to produce a new somatic macronucleus (MAC) from a copy of the germline micronucleus (MIC). This process eliminates noncoding DNA sequences that interrupt genes and also deletes hundreds of germline-limited open reading frames (ORFs) that are transcribed during genome rearrangement. Here, we update the set of transcribed germline-limited ORFs (TGLOs) in O. trifallax. We show that TGLOs tend to be expressed during nuclear development and then are absent from the somatic MAC. We also demonstrate that exposure to synthetic RNA can reprogram TGLO retention in the somatic MAC and that TGLO retention leads to transcription outside the normal developmental program. These data suggest that TGLOs represent a group of developmentally regulated protein-coding sequences whose gene expression is terminated by DNA elimination.", "pub_date": "2021-Jun-17"}, {"title": "SIGAR: Inferring Features of Genome Architecture and DNA Rearrangements by Split-Read Mapping.", "abstract": "Ciliates are microbial eukaryotes with distinct somatic and germline genomes. Postzygotic development involves extensive remodeling of the germline genome to form somatic chromosomes. Ciliates therefore offer a valuable model for studying the architecture and evolution of programed genome rearrangements. Current studies usually focus on a few model species, where rearrangement features are annotated by aligning reference germline and somatic genomes. Although many high-quality somatic genomes have been assembled, a high-quality germline genome assembly is difficult to obtain due to its smaller DNA content and abundance of repetitive sequences. To overcome these hurdles, we propose a new pipeline, SIGAR (Split-read Inference of Genome Architecture and Rearrangements) to infer germline genome architecture and rearrangement features without a germline genome assembly, requiring only short DNA sequencing reads. As a proof of principle, 93% of rearrangement junctions identified by SIGAR in the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax were validated by the existing germline assembly. We then applied SIGAR to six diverse ciliate species without germline genome assemblies, including Ichthyophthirius multifilii, a fish pathogen. Despite the high level of somatic DNA contamination in each sample, SIGAR successfully inferred rearrangement junctions, short eliminated sequences, and potential scrambled genes in each species. This pipeline enables pilot surveys or exploration of DNA rearrangements in species with limited DNA material access, thereby providing new insights into the evolution of chromosome rearrangements.", "pub_date": "2020-Oct-01"}, {"title": "Capture of complete ciliate chromosomes in single sequencing reads reveals widespread chromosome isoforms.", "abstract": "Whole-genome shotgun sequencing, which stitches together millions of short sequencing reads into a single genome, ushered in the era of modern genomics and led to a rapid expansion of the number of genome sequences available. Nevertheless, assembly of short reads remains difficult, resulting in fragmented genome sequences. Ultimately, only a sequencing technology capable of capturing complete chromosomes in a single run could resolve all ambiguities. Even \"third generation\" sequencing technologies produce reads far shorter than most eukaryotic chromosomes.

Here, we captured rearrangement-specific circular DNA molecules across the genome to gain insight into its processes of programmed genome rearrangement. We recovered thousands of circularly excised Tc1/mariner-type transposable elements and high confidence non-repetitive germline-limited loci. We verified their bona fide circular topology using circular DNA deep-sequencing, 2D gel electrophoresis and inverse polymerase chain reaction. In contrast to the precise circular excision of transposable elements, we report widespread heterogeneity in the circular excision of non-repetitive germline-limited loci. We also demonstrate that circular DNAs are transcribed in Oxytricha, producing rearrangement-specific long non-coding RNAs.

Here, we report a DNA 6mA methyltransferase complex in ciliates, termed MTA1c. It consists of two MT-A70 proteins and two homeobox-like DNA-binding proteins and specifically methylates dsDNA. Disruption of the catalytic subunit, MTA1, in the ciliate Oxytricha leads to genome-wide loss of 6mA and abolishment of the consensus ApT dimethylated motif. Mutants fail to complete the sexual cycle, which normally coincides with peak MTA1 expression. We investigate the impact of 6mA on nucleosome occupancy in\u00a0vitro by reconstructing complete, full-length Oxytricha chromosomes harboring 6mA in native or ectopic positions. We show that 6mA directly disfavors nucleosomes in\u00a0vitro in a local, quantitative manner, independent of DNA sequence. Furthermore, the chromatin remodeler ACF can overcome this effect.
