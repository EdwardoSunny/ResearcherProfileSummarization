Here, we show that the PERK arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) regulates both the glomerular coalescence of like axons and the specificity of their projections. Subtle differences in OR protein sequences lead to distinct patterns of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress during OSN development, converting OR identity into distinct gene expression signatures. We identify the transcription factor Ddit3 as a key effector of PERK signaling that maps OR-dependent ER stress patterns to the transcriptional regulation of axon guidance and cell-adhesion genes, instructing targeting precision.

To better understand the mechanism underlying long COVID biology, we compared the short- and long-term systemic responses in the golden hamster after either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 exceeded IAV in its capacity to cause permanent injury to the lung and kidney and uniquely affected the olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory epithelium (OE). Despite a lack of detectable infectious virus, the OB and OE demonstrated myeloid and T cell activation, proinflammatory cytokine production, and an interferon response that correlated with behavioral changes extending a month after viral clearance. These sustained transcriptional changes could also be corroborated from tissue isolated from individuals who recovered from COVID-19. These data highlight a molecular mechanism for persistent COVID-19 symptomology and provide a small animal model to explore future therapeutics.", "pub_date": "2022-Sep-28"}, {"title": "Non-cell-autonomous disruption of nuclear architecture as a potential cause of COVID-19-induced anosmia.", "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infects less than 1% of cells in the human body, yet it can cause severe damage in a variety of organs. Thus, deciphering the non-cell-autonomous effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection is imperative for understanding the cellular and molecular disruption it elicits. Neurological and cognitive defects are among the least understood symptoms of COVID-19 patients, with olfactory dysfunction being their most common sensory deficit. Here, we show that both in humans and hamsters, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes widespread downregulation of olfactory receptors (ORs) and of their signaling components. This non-cell-autonomous effect is preceded by a dramatic reorganization of the neuronal nuclear architecture, which results in dissipation of genomic compartments harboring OR genes.

Choreographed changes to OSN nuclear architecture are evidently necessary for OR expression. Additionally, the insulated organization of OR-enhancers around an OR allele is a hallmark of the chosen OR. However, the biology guiding OR choice itself is unclear. Innovations in single-cell and biophysics-based analysis of nuclear architecture are revising previous models of the nucleus to include its dynamic and probabilistic nature.

Disruption in our ability to detect odors, or anosmia, has emerged as a hallmark symptom of infection with SARS-CoV-2, yet the mechanism behind this abrupt sensory deficit remains elusive. Here, using molecular evaluation of human olfactory epithelium (OE) from subjects succumbing to COVID-19 and a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we discovered widespread downregulation of olfactory receptors (ORs) as well as key components of their signaling pathway. OR downregulation likely represents a non-cell autonomous effect, since SARS-CoV-2 detection in OSNs is extremely rare both in human and hamster OEs. A likely explanation for the reduction of OR transcription is the striking reorganization of nuclear architecture observed in the OSN lineage, which disrupts multi-chromosomal compartments regulating OR expression in humans and hamsters.

Setd1a targets\u00a0are highly expressed in pyramidal neurons and display a complex pattern of transcriptional up- and downregulations shaped by presumed opposing functions of Setd1a on promoters and Mef2-bound enhancers. Notably, evolutionarily conserved Setd1a targets are associated with neuropsychiatric genetic risk burden. Reinstating Setd1a expression in adulthood rescues cognitive deficits. Finally, we identify LSD1 as a major counteracting demethylase for Setd1a and show that its pharmacological antagonism results in a full rescue of the behavioral and morphological deficits in Setd1a-deficient mice.

However, with the development of powerful genomic and imaging tools for the analysis of the 3D genome, and with their application on an increasing number of cell types, it becomes apparent that regulated, specific, and functionally important inter-chromosomal contacts exist. Widespread and stereotypic inter-chromosomal interactions are at the center of chemosensation, where they regulate the singular and stochastic expression of olfactory receptor genes. In olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) coalescence of multiple intergenic enhancers to a multi-chromosomal hub orchestrates the expression of a single OR allele, whereas convergence of the remaining OR genes from 18 chromosomes into a few heterochromatic compartments mediates their effective transcriptional silencing. In this review we describe the role of interchromosomal interactions in OR gene choice, and we describe other biological systems where such genomic interactions may contribute to regulatory robustness and transcriptional diversification.", "pub_date": "2019"}, {"title": "Live-cell imaging reveals enhancer-dependent ", "abstract": "Enhancers are important regulatory elements that can control gene activity across vast genetic distances.

Transcription of an antisense long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) from this antisense promoter extends through the sense promoter, leading to DNA demethylation of the CTCF binding sites proximal to each promoter. Demethylation-dependent CTCF binding to both promoters facilitates cohesin-mediated DNA looping with a distal enhancer (HS5-1), locking in the transcriptional state of the chosen Pcdh\u03b1 gene. Uncoupling DNA demethylation from antisense transcription by Tet3 overexpression in mouse olfactory neurons promotes CTCF binding to all Pcdh\u03b1 promoters, resulting in proximity-biased DNA looping of the HS5-1 enhancer. Thus, antisense\u00a0transcription-mediated promoter demethylation functions as a mechanism for distance-independent enhancer/promoter DNA looping to ensure stochastic Pcdh\u03b1 promoter choice.", "pub_date": "2019-Apr-18"}]}
