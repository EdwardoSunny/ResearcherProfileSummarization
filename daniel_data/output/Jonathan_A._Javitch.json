Ligand binding to these receptors activates G proteins and arrestins, which function in different signaling pathways. Given that functionally selective or biased ligands preferentially activate one of these two groups of pathways, they may be superior medications for certain disease states. The identification of such ligands requires robust drug screening assays for both G protein and arrestin activity. This unit describes protocols for assays that monitor reversible arrestin recruitment to GPCRs in living cells using either bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) or nanoluciferase complementation (NanoLuc). Two types of assays can be used: one configuration directly measures arrestin recruitment to a GPCR fused to a protein tag at its intracellular C-terminus, whereas the other configuration detects arrestin translocation to the plasma membrane in response to activation of an unmodified GPCR. Together, these assays are powerful tools for studying dynamic interactions between GPCRs and arrestins. \u00a9 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the dorsal striatum (dStr) encode action sequences through changes in firing at the start and/or stop of action sequences or sustained changes in firing throughout the sequence. Acetylcholine (ACh), released from cholinergic interneurons (ChIs), regulates striatal function by modulating MSN and interneuron excitability, dopamine and glutamate release, and synaptic plasticity. Cholinergic neurons in dStr pause their tonic firing during the performance of learned action sequences. Activation of dopamine type-2 receptors (D2Rs) on ChIs is one mechanism of ChI pausing. In this study we show that deleting D2Rs from ChIs by crossing D2-floxed with ChAT-Cre mice (D2Flox-ChATCre), which inhibits dopamine-mediated ChI pausing and leads to deficits in an operant action sequence task and lower breakpoints in a progressive ratio task. These data suggest that D2Flox-ChATCre mice have reduced motivation to work for sucrose reward, but show no generalized motor skill deficits. D2Flox-ChATCre mice perform similarly to controls in a simple reversal learning task, indicating normal behavioral flexibility, a cognitive function associated with ChIs.

The expansion of smFRET imaging into living cells creates both numerous new research opportunities and new challenges. Automating dataset curation processes is critical to providing consistent, repeatable analysis in an efficient manner, freeing experimentalists to advance the technical boundaries and throughput of what is possible in imaging living cells. Here, we devise an automated solution to the problem of multiple particles entering a region of interest, an otherwise labor-intensive and subjective process that had been performed manually in our previous work. The resolution of these two issues increases the quantity of FRET data and improves the accuracy with which FRET distributions are generated, increasing knowledge about the biological functions of the molecules under study. Our automated approach is straightforward, interpretable, and requires only localization and intensity values for donor and acceptor channel signals, which we compute through our previously published smCellFRET pipeline. The development of our automated approach is informed by the insights of expert experimentalists with extensive experience inspecting smFRET trajectories (displacement and intensity traces) from live cells. We test our automated approach against our recently published research on the metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) and reveal substantial similarities, as well as potential shortcomings in the manual curation process that are addressable using the algorithms we developed here.", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Correction: Impact of membrane lipid polyunsaturation on dopamine D2 receptor ligand binding and signaling.", "abstract": null, "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Assessment of the potential of novel and classical opioids to induce respiratory depression in mice.", "abstract": "Opioid-induced respiratory depression limits the use of \u03bc-opioid receptor agonists in clinical settings and is the main cause of opioid overdose fatalities.

Tianeptine (TIAN) is an atypical antidepressant that activates the mu-opioid receptor but does not produce analgesic tolerance or withdrawal in mice, nor euphoria in humans, at clinically-relevant doses. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of TIAN at persistently alleviating mechanical allodynia in the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain, even well after drug clearance. After finding an accelerated onset of antiallodynic action compared to DMI, we used genetically modified mice to gain insight into RGS protein-associated pathways that modulate the efficacy of TIAN relative to DMI in models of neuropathic pain. Because we observed similar behavioral responses to both TIAN and DMI treatment in RGS4, RGSz1, and RGS9 knockout mice, we performed RNA sequencing on the NAc of TIAN- and DMI-treated mice after prolonged SNI to further clarify potential mechanisms underlying TIANs faster therapeutic actions. Our bioinformatic analysis revealed distinct transcriptomic signatures between the two drugs, with TIAN more directly reversing SNI-induced differentially expressed genes, and further predicted several upstream regulators that may be implicated in onset of action. This new understanding of the molecular pathways underlying TIAN action may enable the development of novel and more efficacious pharmacological approaches for the management of neuropathic pain.", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Free fatty acid receptor 1 stimulates cAMP production and gut hormone secretion through Gq-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase 2.", "abstract": "Free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFAR1) is highly expressed in enteroendocrine cells of the small intestine and pancreatic beta cells, where FFAR1 agonists function as GLP-1 and insulin secretagogues, respectively.

In particular, the biostatus of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) correlates with some symptoms of psychiatric disorders, as well as the efficacy of pharmacological treatments. Recent findings highlight a direct association between brain PUFA levels and dopamine transmission, a major neuromodulatory system implicated in the etiology of psychiatric symptoms. However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are still unknown. Here we demonstrate that membrane enrichment in the n-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), potentiates ligand binding to the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), suggesting that DHA acts as an allosteric modulator of this receptor. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm that DHA has a high preference for interaction with the D2R and show that membrane unsaturation selectively enhances the conformational dynamics of the receptor around its second intracellular loop. We find that membrane unsaturation spares G protein activity but potentiates the recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin in cells. Furthermore, in vivo n-3 PUFA deficiency blunts the behavioral effects of two D2R ligands, quinpirole and aripiprazole. These results highlight the importance of membrane unsaturation for D2R activity and provide a putative mechanism for the ability of PUFAs to enhance antipsychotic efficacy.", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Disentangling autoproteolytic cleavage from tethered agonist-dependent activation of the adhesion receptor ADGRL3.", "abstract": "Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor latrophilin 3 (ADGRL3), a cell adhesion molecule highly expressed in the central nervous system, acts in synapse formation through trans interactions with its ligands. It is largely unknown if these interactions serve a purely adhesive function or can modulate G protein signaling. To assess how different structural elements of ADGRL3 (e.g., the adhesive domains, autoproteolytic cleavage site, or tethered agonist (TA)) impact receptor function, we require constructs that disrupt specific receptor features without impacting others. While we showed previously that mutating conserved Phe and Met residues in the TA of ADGRL3-C-terminal fragment (CTF), a CTF truncated to the G protein-coupled receptor proteolysis site, abolishes receptor-mediated G protein activation, we now find that autoproteolytic cleavage is disrupted in the full-length version of this construct. To identify a construct that disrupts TA-dependent activity without impacting proteolysis, we explored other mutations in the TA. We found that mutating the sixth and seventh residues of the TA, Leu and Met, to Ala impaired activity in a serum response element activity assay for both full-length and CTF constructs. We confirmed this activity loss results from impaired G protein coupling using an assay that acutely exposes the TA through controlled proteolysis. The ADGRL3 mutant expresses normally at the cell surface, and immunoblotting shows that it undergoes normal autoproteolysis. Thus, we found a construct that disrupts tethered agonism while retaining autoproteolytic cleavage, providing a tool to disentangle these functions in\u00a0vivo.
