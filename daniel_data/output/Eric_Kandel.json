Ribonucleoprotein granules (RNPs) are a type of biomolecular condensate necessary for local protein synthesis and are involved in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. Most of the proteins in RNPs possess low-complexity motifs (LCM), allowing for increased promiscuity of protein-protein interactions. Here, we describe the importance of protein-protein interactions mediated by the LCM of RNA-binding protein cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 3 (CPEB3). CPEB3 is necessary for long-term synaptic plasticity and memory persistence, but the mechanisms involved are still not completely elucidated. We now present key mechanisms involved in its regulation of synaptic plasticity. We find that CPEB3-LCM plays a role in appropriate local protein synthesis of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) targets, through crucial protein-protein interactions that drive localization to neuronal Decapping protein 1 (DCP1)-bodies. Translation-promoting CPEB3 and translation-inhibiting CPEB1 are packaged into neuronal RNP granules immediately after chemical long-term potentiation is induced, but only translation-promoting CPEB3 is repackaged to these organelles at later time points. This localization to neuronal RNP granules is critical for functional influence on translation as well as overall local protein synthesis (measured as \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) insertion into the membrane and localization to the synapse). We therefore conclude that protein-protein interaction between the LCM of CPEB3 plays a critical role in local protein synthesis by utilizing neuronal RNP granules.", "pub_date": "2023-Feb-07"}, {"title": "Synaptoproteomic Analysis of the Prefrontal Cortex Reveals Spatio-Temporal Changes in SYNGAP1 Following Cannabinoid Exposure in Rat Adolescence.", "abstract": "The regular use of cannabis during adolescence has been associated with a number of negative life outcomes, including psychopathology and cognitive impairments. However, the exact molecular mechanisms that underlie these outcomes are just beginning to be understood. Moreover, very little is known about the spatio-temporal molecular changes that occur following cannabinoid exposure in adolescence. To understand these changes, we exposed mid-adolescent male rats to a synthetic cannabinoid (WIN 55,212-2 mesylate; WIN) and, following drug abstinence through late adolescence, we subjected the synaptosomal fractions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to proteomic analyses. A total of N = 487 differentially expressed proteins were found in WIN-exposed animals compared to controls. Gene ontology analyses revealed enrichment of terms related to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurotransmitter system. Among the top differentially expressed proteins was the synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein 1 (SYNGAP1). Using Western blotting experiments, we found that the WIN-induced upregulation of SYNGAP1 was spatio-temporal in nature, arising only in the synaptosomal fractions (not in the cytosol) and only following prolonged drug abstinence (not on abstinence day 1). Moreover, the SYNGAP1 changes were found to be specific to WIN-exposure in adolescence and not adulthood.

Although recent studies identify the importance of the dorsal CA2 region of the hippocampus in social memory storage, little is known about its sources of social information. Because CA2, like other hippocampal regions, receives its major source of spatial and non-spatial information from the medial and lateral subdivisions of entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC), respectively, we investigated the importance of these inputs for social memory. Whereas MEC inputs to CA2 are dispensable, the direct inputs to CA2 from LEC are both selectively activated during social exploration and required for social memory. This selective behavioral role of LEC is reflected in the stronger excitatory drive it provides to CA2 compared with MEC. Thus, a direct LEC \u2192 CA2 circuit is tuned to convey social information that is critical for social memory.", "pub_date": "2022-May-04"}, {"title": "A fast, aqueous, reversible three-day tissue clearing method for adult and embryonic mouse brain and whole body.", "abstract": "Optical clearing methods serve as powerful tools to study intact organs and neuronal circuits.

We examine somatic, dendritic, and axonal mitochondria in the dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) of the mouse hippocampus, two subregions with distinct principal cell types and functions.

Although most studies of interneurons have focused on their role in fast synaptic inhibition mediated by GABA release, different classes of interneurons express unique sets of neuropeptides, many of which have been shown to exert powerful effects on neuronal function and memory when applied pharmacologically. However, relatively little is known about whether and how release of endogenous neuropeptides from inhibitory cells contributes to their behavioral role in regulating memory formation. Here we report that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons participate in social memory storage by enhancing information transfer from hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons to CA2 pyramidal neurons. Notably, this action depends on release of the neuropeptide enkephalin from VIP neurons, causing long-term depression of feedforward inhibition onto CA2 pyramidal cells. Moreover, VIP neuron activity in the CA2 region is increased selectively during exploration of a novel conspecific. Our findings, thus, enhance our appreciation of how GABAergic neurons can regulate synaptic plasticity and mnemonic behavior by demonstrating that such actions can be mediated by release of a specific neuropeptide, rather than through classic fast inhibitory transmission.", "pub_date": "2022"}, {"title": "Loss of retinoid X receptor gamma subunit impairs group 1 mGluR mediated electrophysiological responses and group 1 mGluR dependent behaviors.", "abstract": "Retinoid X receptors are members of the nuclear receptor family that regulate gene expression in response to retinoic acid and related ligands. Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors are G-protein coupled transmembrane receptors that activate intracellular signaling cascades in response to the neurotransmitter, glutamate. These two classes of molecules have been studied independently and found to play important roles in regulating neuronal physiology with potential clinical implications for disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that mice lacking the retinoid X receptor subunit, RXR\u03b3, exhibit impairments in group 1 mGluR-mediated electrophysiological responses at hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapses, including impaired group 1 mGluR-dependent long-term synaptic depression (LTD), reduced group 1 mGluR-induced calcium release, and loss of group 1 mGluR-activated voltage-sensitive currents. These animals also exhibit impairments in a subset of group 1 mGluR-dependent behaviors, including motor performance, spatial object recognition, and prepulse inhibition. Together, these observations demonstrate convergence between the RXR\u03b3 and group 1 mGluR signaling pathways that may function to coordinate their regulation of neuronal activity.

In this study we evaluate the effects of social isolation on physical activity in mice. Utilizing a pixel-based tracking system, we continuously monitored the movement of isolated mice compared with paired cage mates in the home cage environment. We demonstrate that mice that are socially isolated dramatically decrease their movement when separated from their cage mate, and especially in the dark cycle, when mice are normally most active. When isolated mice are re-paired with their original cage mate, this effect is reversed, and mice return to their prior levels of activity. These findings suggest a close link between social isolation and physical activity, and are of particular interest in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019, when many are forced into isolation. Social isolation may affect an individual's overall activity levels in humans too, which may have unintended effects on health that deserve further consideration.", "pub_date": "2021"}, {"title": "Micellar TIA1 with folded RNA binding domains as a model for reversible stress granule formation.", "abstract": "TIA1, a protein critical for eukaryotic stress response and stress granule formation, is structurally characterized in full-length form.

CLT is based on experimental data showing that psychologically distant events (i.e., occurring farther away in space or time) are represented more abstractly than closer events. We measured construal level elicited by abstract vs. representational art and asked subjects to assign abstract/representational paintings by the same artist to a situation that was temporally/spatially near or distant. Across three experiments, we found that abstract paintings were assigned to the distant situation significantly more often than representational paintings, indicating that abstract art was evocative of greater psychological distance.
