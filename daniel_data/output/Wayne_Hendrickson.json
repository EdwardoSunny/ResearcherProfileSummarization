SLow Anion Channel 1 (SLAC1) mediates anion efflux from guard cells and plays a crucial role in controlling stomatal aperture. It serves as a central hub for multiple signaling pathways in response to environmental stimuli, with its activity regulated through phosphorylation via various plant protein kinases. However, the molecular mechanism underlying SLAC1 phosphoactivation has remained elusive. Through a combination of protein sequence analyses, AlphaFold-based modeling and electrophysiological studies, we unveiled that the highly conserved motifs on the N- and C-terminal segments of SLAC1 form a cytosolic regulatory domain (CRD) that interacts with the transmembrane domain(TMD), thereby maintaining the channel in an autoinhibited state. Mutations in these conserved motifs destabilize the CRD, releasing autoinhibition in SLAC1 and enabling its transition into an activated state. Our further studies demonstrated that SLAC1 activation undergoes an autoinhibition-release process and subsequent structural changes in the pore helices. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the activation mechanism of SLAC1 and shed light on understanding how SLAC1 controls stomatal closure in response to environmental stimuli.", "pub_date": "2024-Jul-16"}, {"title": "Promiscuous G-protein activation by the calcium-sensing receptor.", "abstract": "The human calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) detects fluctuations in the extracellular Ca", "pub_date": "2024"}, {"title": "Facing the phase problem.", "abstract": "The marvel of X-ray crystallography is the beauty and precision of the atomic structures deduced from diffraction patterns. Since these patterns record only amplitudes, phases for the diffracted waves must also be evaluated for systematic structure determination. Thus, we have the phase problem as a central complication, both intellectually for the field and practically so for many analyses. Here, I discuss how we - myself, my laboratory and the diffraction community - have faced the phase problem, considering the evolution of methods for phase evaluation as structural biology developed to the present day. During the explosive growth of macromolecular crystallography, practice in diffraction analysis evolved from a universal reliance on isomorphous replacement to the eventual domination of anomalous diffraction for de novo structure determination. As the Protein Data Bank (PDB) grew and familial relationships among proteins became clear, molecular replacement overtook all other phasing methods; however, experimental phasing remained essential for molecules without obvious precedents, with multi- and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD and SAD) predominating. While the mathematics-based direct methods had proved to be inadequate for typical macromolecules, they returned to crack substantial selenium substructures in SAD analyses of selenomethionyl proteins. Native SAD, exploiting the intrinsic S and P atoms of biomolecules, has become routine. Selenomethionyl SAD and MAD were the mainstays of structural genomics efforts to populate the PDB with novel proteins. A recent dividend has been paid in the success of PDB-trained artificial intelligence approaches for protein structure prediction. Currently, molecular replacement with AlphaFold models often obviates the need for experimental phase evaluation. For multiple reasons, we are now unfazed by the phase problem. Cryo-EM analysis is an attractive alternative to crystallography for many applications faced by today's structural biologists. It simply finesses the phase problem; however, the principles and procedures of diffraction analysis remain pertinent and are adopted in single-particle cryo-EM studies of biomolecules.", "pub_date": "2023-Sep-01"}, {"title": "Heterobimetallic Base Pair Programming in Designer 3D DNA Crystals.", "abstract": "Metal-mediated DNA (mmDNA) presents a pathway toward engineering bioinorganic and electronic behavior into DNA devices. Many chemical and biophysical forces drive the programmable chelation of metals between pyrimidine base pairs. Here, we developed a crystallographic method using the three-dimensional (3D) DNA tensegrity triangle motif to capture single- and multi-metal binding modes across granular changes to environmental pH using anomalous scattering. Leveraging this programmable crystal, we determined 28 biomolecular structures to capture mmDNA reactions. We found that silver(I) binds with increasing occupancy in T-T and U-U pairs at elevated pH levels, and we exploited this to capture silver(I) and mercury(II) within the same base pair and to isolate the titration points for homo- and heterometal base pair modes. We additionally determined the structure of a C-C pair with both silver(I) and mercury(II). Finally, we extend our paradigm to capture cadmium(II) in T-T pairs together with mercury(II) at high pH.

CD4-mimetic compounds (CD4mcs) bind the gp120 Env, block CD4 binding, and inactivate Env. Previous studies suggested that a C(5)-methylamino methyl moiety on a lead CD4mc, BNM-III-170, contributed to its antiviral potency. By replacing the C(5) chain with differentially substituted pyrrolidine, piperidine, and piperazine ring systems, guided by structural and computational analyses, we found that the 5-position of BNM-III-170 is remarkably tolerant of a variety of ring sizes and substitutions, both in regard to antiviral activity and sensitization to humoral responses. Crystallographic analyses of representative analogues from the pyrrolidine series revealed the potential for 5-substituents to hydrogen bond with gp120 Env residue Thr 283.

As an alternative to these cell-based systems, cell-free protein synthesis has proven to be an exquisite method for screening membrane protein targets in a variety of lipidic mimetics. Here we report a high-throughput screening workflow and apply it to screen 61 eukaryotic membrane protein targets. For each target, we tested its expression in lipidic mimetics: two detergents, two liposomes, and two nanodiscs. We show that 35 membrane proteins (57%) can be expressed in a soluble fraction in at least one of the mimetics with the two detergents performing significantly better than nanodiscs and liposomes, in that order. Using the established cell-free workflow, we studied the production and biophysical assays for mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) complexes.
