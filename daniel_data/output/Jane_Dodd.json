Animal-borne sensors can address data gaps, improve ocean model skill and support model validation, but previous studies in this area have focused almost exclusively on satellite-telemetered seabirds and seals. Here, for the first time, we develop the use of benthic species as animal oceanographers by combining archival (depth and temperature) data from animal-borne tags, passive acoustic telemetry and citizen-science mark-recapture records from 2016-17 for the Critically Endangered flapper skate (Dipturus intermedius) in Scotland. By comparing temperature observations to predictions from the West Scotland Coastal Ocean Modelling System, we quantify model skill and empirically validate an independent model update. The results from bottom-temperature and temperature-depth profile validation (5,324 observations) fill a key data gap in Scotland. For predictions in 2016, we identified a consistent warm bias (mean\u2009=\u20090.53\u00a0\u00b0C) but a subsequent model update reduced bias by an estimated 109% and improved model skill. This study uniquely demonstrates the use of benthic animal-borne sensors and citizen-science data for ocean model validation, broadening the range of animal oceanographers in aquatic environments.", "pub_date": "2022-Oct-05"}, {"title": "SpineRacks and SpinalJ for efficient analysis of neurons in a 3D reference atlas of the mouse spinal cord.", "abstract": "Spatial analysis of spinal neurons is currently limited by a lack of tools for efficient preparation and imaging of the whole spinal cord (SC) and the absence of a 3D reference atlas.

That these divergent responses can be activated in the same cell raises the question of how the BMP-dependent signaling apparatus is manipulated to produce chemotropic and transcriptional signals. RNA interference and site-directed mutagenesis were used to explore functional and structural BMP receptor requirements for BMP7-evoked chemotropic activity. We show that specific type II BMP receptor subunits, ActRIIA and BMPR2, are required for BMP7-induced growth cone collapse in developing spinal neurons and for chemotaxis of monocytes. Reintroduction of wild-type ActRIIA into monocytic cells lacking endogenous ActRIIA restores BMP7-evoked chemotaxis, whereas expression of an ActRIIA K76A receptor variant fails to rescue. BMP7-evoked Smad-dependent signaling is unaffected by either ActRIIA knockdown or expression of the ActRIIA K76A variant. In contrast, BMP7-evoked PI3K-dependent signaling is significantly disturbed in the presence of ActRIIA K76A. These results support a model for selective engagement of chemotropic BMPs with type II BMP receptors, through specific residues, that results in strict regulation of PI3K-dependent signal transduction.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.", "pub_date": "2019-Jul-16"}, {"title": "Structural distinctions in BMPs underlie divergent signaling in spinal neurons.", "abstract": "In dorsal spinal neurons and monocytes, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)7 activates distinct transduction pathways, one leading to inductive specification and the other to axon orientation and chemotaxis. BMP7-evoked induction, also stimulated by the closely related BMP6, acts through a Smad cascade, leading to nuclear signaling, and is not BMPR subunit selective. Orientation is evoked by BMP7, but not by BMP6, through PI3K-dependent cytoskeletal activation mediated by the type II BMPRs, ActRIIA and BMPRII and is independent of the Smad cascade. The responses can be stimulated concurrently and suggest that BMP7, but not BMP6, can selectively activate BMPR subunits that engage the divergent paths. Although structural and biochemical analyses of selected BMP/BMPR interfaces have identified key regions of interaction, how these translate into function by related BMPs is poorly understood. To determine the mechanisms underlying the distinct activities of BMP7 and the disparate properties of BMP7 and BMP6 in spinal cord development, we have performed a family-wide structure/function analysis of BMPs and used the information to predict and test sites within BMPs that may control agonist properties, in particular the ability of a BMP to orient axons, through interactions with BMPRs.", "pub_date": "2012-May-04"}, {"title": "Inductive specification and axonal orientation of spinal neurons mediated by divergent bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathways.", "abstract": "Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)7 evokes both inductive and axon orienting responses in dorsal interneurons (dI neurons) in the developing spinal cord. These events occur sequentially during the development of spinal neurons but in these and other cell types such inductive and acute chemotactic responses occur concurrently, highlighting the requirement for divergent intracellular signaling. Both type I and type II BMP receptor subtypes have been implicated selectively in orienting responses but it remains unclear how, in a given cell, divergence occurs.

The signaling pathways underlying these rapid processes likely diverge from those mediating classical transcriptional responses to BMPs but it remains unclear how BMP receptors are utilized to generate distinct intracellular mechanisms. We show that BMP7-evoked chemotaxis of monocytic cells depends on the activity of canonical type II BMP receptors. Although the three canonical type II BMP receptors are expressed in monocytic cells, inhibition of receptor subunit expression by RNAi reveals that ActRIIA and BMPRII, but not ActRIIB, are each essential for BMP7-evoked chemotaxis but not required individually for BMP-mediated induction. Furthermore, the chemotactic response to BMP7 does not involve canonical Smad4-dependent signaling but acts through PI3K-dependent signaling, illustrating selective activation of distinct intracellular events through differential engagement of receptors. We suggest a model of a BMP receptor complex in which the coordinated activity of ActRIIA and BMPRII receptor subunits selectively mediates the chemotactic response to BMP7.", "pub_date": "2009-Dec-08"}, {"title": "A molecular program for contralateral trajectory: Rig-1 control by LIM homeodomain transcription factors.", "abstract": "Despite increasing evidence for transcriptional control of neural connectivity, how transcription factors regulate discrete steps in axon guidance remains obscure. Projection neurons in the dorsal spinal cord relay sensory signals to higher brain centers. Some projection neurons send their axons ipsilaterally, whereas others, commissural neurons, send axons contralaterally. We show that two closely related LIM homeodomain proteins, Lhx2 and Lhx9, are expressed by a set of commissural relay neurons (dI1c neurons) and are required for the dI1c axon projection. Midline crossing by dI1c axons is lost in Lhx2/9 double mutants, a defect that results from loss of expression of Rig-1 from dI1c axons. Lhx2 binds to a conserved motif in the Rig-1 gene, suggesting that Lhx2/9 regulate directly the expression of Rig-1. Our findings reveal a link between the transcriptional programs that define neuronal subtype identity and the expression of receptors that guide distinctive aspects of their trajectory.", "pub_date": "2008-Aug-14"}, {"title": "Development: edging towards circuitry, behavior and disease.", "abstract": null, "pub_date": "2005"}, {"title": "A role for BMP heterodimers in roof plate-mediated repulsion of commissural axons.", "abstract": "During spinal cord development, commissural neurons extend their axons ventrally, away from the roof plate. The roof plate is the source of a diffusible repellent that orients commissural axons in vitro and, thus, may regulate the trajectory of commissural axons in vivo. Of three Bmps expressed in the roof plate, BMP7, but not BMP6 or GDF7, mimics the roof plate activity in vitro. We show here that expression of both Bmp7 and Gdf7 by roof plate cells is required for the fidelity of commissural axon growth in vivo. We also demonstrate that BMP7 and GDF7 heterodimerize in vitro and that, under these conditions, GDF7 enhances the axon-orienting activity of BMP7. Our findings suggest that a GDF7:BMP7 heterodimer functions as a roof plate-derived repellent that establishes the initial ventral trajectory of commissural axons.", "pub_date": "2003-May-08"}]}
