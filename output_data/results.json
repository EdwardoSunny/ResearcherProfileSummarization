The researcher has made significant contributions to creating 3D skin models that enable the study of immune cell trafficking, which is crucial for understanding skin diseases and developing therapeutic strategies. The development of organ-on-a-chip systems represents another important area of research, allowing for the study of human diseases and drug responses in a controlled microenvironment that simulates human physiology. In this context, microfluidic devices are utilized to create perfusable vascular networks and to study the interactions between immune cells and skin vasculature, facilitating real-time imaging of cellular behaviors and drug testing. The use of iPSCs is also prominent in this researcher's work, particularly in generating skin organoids and modeling diseases such as recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa through CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques. This approach allows for the correction of genetic defects and the study of their effects on skin structure and function. Vascular biology is another key area, with research focused on engineering tissue-specific blood vessels and understanding endothelial cell behavior in health and disease, including the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells in response to injury. The researcher has also explored the role of microphysiological systems in drug testing, emphasizing the importance of creating in vitro models that accurately reflect human tissue responses to pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the investigation of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy highlights the need for better understanding the mechanisms of drug-induced side effects, while studies on atopic dermatitis aim to elucidate the interactions between immune signaling and sensory neurons. Finally, the use of biomaterials and organoids is explored to enhance tissue morphogenesis and improve the functionality of engineered tissues, particularly in the context of cancer biology, where the effects of matrix stiffness and oxygen tension on tumor progression are examined. Overall, this researcher's work spans a diverse range of topics, all aimed at advancing our understanding of skin biology and improving therapeutic strategies for skin-related diseases.",
        "DivConq": "This researcher's research directions can be categorized into the following atomic topics and fields: organ-specific vasculature-on-a-chip systems, skin organoids, microphysiological systems (MPS), gene editing, tissue engineering, biomaterials, 3D skin models, immune cell behavior, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), itch sensory neuron-like cells, angiogenesis, psoriatic skin constructs, human-on-a-chip systems, and mpox pathogenesis. Organ-specific vasculature-on-a-chip systems are developed to replicate the unique vascular characteristics of different organs, enhancing the understanding of organ-specific drug delivery and tissue regeneration. The research on skin organoids focuses on generating pluripotent stem cell-derived skin organoids (PSOs) in a chemically-defined 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) environment, addressing issues like inverted anatomy and necrosis, and demonstrating the importance of ECM and morphogen gradients in skin development. Microphysiological systems (MPS) are highlighted for their role in drug testing, distinguishing between pumped and pumpless devices, which leverage gravity for fluid circulation, thus facilitating studies on drug toxicity and efficacy. In gene editing, the researcher employs CRISPR/Cas9 technology to correct mutations in the COL7A1 gene linked to recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, successfully generating functional skin equivalents in animal models. Tissue engineering is explored through the creation of human hair follicles within skin constructs, showcasing potential treatments for alopecia and chronic wounds, while biomaterials research emphasizes the need for precise control over biochemical cues in organoid culture to enhance tissue development. The development of advanced 3D skin models aims to investigate immune cell behavior, neuropathy mechanisms, and skin disease treatments, including the introduction of a biopsy-sized 3D skin-on-a-chip model for real-time imaging of immune cell interactions. The study of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) highlights the necessity for effective models to understand neuronal interactions in skin pathology. Additionally, the research explores the creation of human skin models innervated with itch sensory neuron-like cells, which respond to itch stimuli, providing a platform for drug development for atopic dermatitis. The angiogenic capabilities of various endothelial cell sources in engineered skin grafts are quantitatively compared, revealing insights into dermal maturation and graft viability. The development of a novel psoriatic human skin construct incorporating T cells for drug testing illustrates the model's relevance in studying inflammatory skin diseases. The design principles for human-on-a-chip systems are outlined, emphasizing their application in pharmacokinetics and drug development. Lastly, the research on mpox pathogenesis underscores the potential of a human skin-on-a-chip model to study the disease comprehensively, enhancing predictive capabilities for therapeutic interventions and contributing to effective evaluations of treatments and preventive measures against mpox."
